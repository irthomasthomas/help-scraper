CREATE-WEB-ACL()                                              CREATE-WEB-ACL()



NAME
       create-web-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a  WebACL per the specifications provided.

       A  web  ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control
       web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or  count)
       for  requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you
       assign a default action to take (allow, block)  for  any  request  that
       does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combi-
       nation of the types  Rule ,  RuleGroup , and managed  rule  group.  You
       can  associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources
       to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution,  an
       Amazon  API  Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync
       GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL af-
          ter you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an App-
          Sync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --default-action (structure)
          The action to perform if none of the Rules contained in  the  WebACL
          match.

          Block -> (structure)
              Specifies that WAF should block requests by default.

              CustomResponse -> (structure)
                 Defines a custom response for the web request.

                 For information about customizing web requests and responses,
                 see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the  WAF
                 Developer Guide .

                 ResponseCode -> (integer)
                     The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                     For  a list of status codes that you can use in your cus-
                     tom responses, see Supported status codes for custom  re-
                     sponse in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                     References  the response body that you want WAF to return
                     to the web request client. You can define  a  custom  re-
                     sponse for a rule action or a default web ACL action that
                     is set to block. To do this, you  first  define  the  re-
                     sponse  body  key  and  value in the CustomResponseBodies
                     setting for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you  want  to
                     use  it.  Then, in the rule action or web ACL default ac-
                     tion BlockAction setting, you reference the response body
                     using this key.

                 ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                     The HTTP headers to use in the response. Duplicate header
                     names are not allowed.

                     For information about the limits on count  and  size  for
                     custom  request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A custom header for custom request and  response  han-
                        dling.  This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRe-
                        questHandling .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the custom header.

                            For custom request header insertion, when WAF  in-
                            serts  the  header  into  the request, it prefixes
                            this name x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                            the  headers  that are already in the request. For
                            example, for the header name sample , WAF  inserts
                            the header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the custom header.

              Specifies that WAF should allow requests by default.

              CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                 Defines custom handling for the web request.

                 For information about customizing web requests and responses,
                 see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the  WAF
                 Developer Guide .

                 InsertHeaders -> (list)
                     The  HTTP  headers  to insert into the request. Duplicate
                     header names are not allowed.

                     For information about the limits on count  and  size  for
                     custom  request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A custom header for custom request and  response  han-
                        dling.  This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRe-
                        questHandling .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the custom header.

                            For custom request header insertion, when WAF  in-
                            serts  the  header  into  the request, it prefixes
                            this name x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                            the  headers  that are already in the request. For
                            example, for the header name sample , WAF  inserts
                            the header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the custom header.

          }

       --description (string)
          A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

       --rules (list)
          The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you want
          to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one  top-level  state-
          ment that WAF uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters
          that govern how WAF handles them.

          (structure)
              A single rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or   RuleGroup  to
              identify  web  requests that you want to allow, block, or count.
              Each rule includes one top-level  Statement  that  WAF  uses  to
              identify  matching  web requests, and parameters that govern how
              WAF handles them.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule. You can't change the name of a Rule af-
                 ter you create it.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 If  you define more than one Rule in a WebACL , WAF evaluates
                 each request against the Rules in order based on the value of
                 Priority . WAF processes rules with lower priority first. The
                 priorities don't need to be consecutive, but they must all be
                 different.

              Statement -> (structure)
                 The  WAF  processing  statement  for  the  rule,  for example
                 ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

                 ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that defines a string match  search  for
                     WAF  to  apply  to web requests. The byte match statement
                     provides the bytes to search for,  the  location  in  re-
                     quests  that  you want WAF to search, and other settings.
                     The bytes to search for are typically a string that  cor-
                     responds  with  ASCII  characters. In the WAF console and
                     the developer guide, this is called a string match state-
                     ment.

                     SearchString -> (blob)
                        A  string  value  that you want WAF to search for. WAF
                        searches only in the part of  web  requests  that  you
                        designate  for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The maxi-
                        mum length of the value is 200 bytes.

                        Valid values depend on the component that you  specify
                        for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                        o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search
                          for. This indicates the type of operation  specified
                          in the request.

                        o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF to search for
                          in the URI path, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and
                        a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                            If you're using the WAF API

                        Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the value. The
                        maximum length of the value before  you  base64-encode
                        it is 200 bytes.

                        For  example,  suppose the value of Type is HEADER and
                        the value of Data is  User-Agent  .  If  you  want  to
                        search  the  User-Agent  header for the value BadBot ,
                        you base64-encode BadBot  using  MIME  base64-encoding
                        and  include  the  resulting  value, QmFkQm90 , in the
                        value of SearchString .
                            If you're using the CLI or one of the  Amazon  Web
                            Services SDKs

                        The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK au-
                        tomatically base64 encodes the value.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The part of the web request that you want WAF  to  in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name of the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately, you can filter and inspect all  head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a single query argument. Provide the name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or  SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part of
                            the web request that identifies  a  resource,  for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  query  string. This is the part of a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as plain  text.  The  re-
                            quest  body  immediately follows the request head-
                            ers. This is the part of a request  that  contains
                            any  additional data that you want to send to your
                            web server as the HTTP request body, such as  data
                            from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see  the  Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF
                               inspects the results of these  pattern  matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match  all of the elements. See also Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide  the  include  paths   using   JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]  .
                                   For  information about this syntax, see the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't  use  this  option  to include all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the JSON to  match  against  using
                               the  MatchPattern  .  If  you specify All , WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  headers. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Headers
                            object,  to  define  the set of headers to and the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            headers  and  only  the first 200 headers are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,  WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request headers when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  headers. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the headers normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-
                               ies":  {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToInclude2", "Key-
                               ToInclude3"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the cookies to inspect with the
                               rule inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request cookies when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  cookies. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  cookies
                               and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the cookies normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations  in a rule statement, WAF performs all
                        transformations on the content of the  request  compo-
                        nent  identified  by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations that are  defined  for  a  rule
                               statement.  WAF  processes all transformations,
                               from lowest priority  to  highest,  before  in-
                               specting  the  transformed content. The priori-
                               ties don't need to  be  consecutive,  but  they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You  can  specify  the following transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64  -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -  Decode  a Base64 -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation  that ignores characters that aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line  command  and use unusual for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-
                                   mand.

                               o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                               o Delete  spaces  before  the following charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace  the  following  characters  with   a
                                 space: , ;

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert  uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these  char-
                                   acters with a space character (decimal 32):

                               o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE - Decode  characters  that  were
                                   encoded  using  CSS  2.x  escape rules syn-
                                   data.html#characters . This  function  uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it can help  to  uncover  ASCII  characters
                                   that  were  encoded using CSS encoding that
                                   wouldnt typically  be  encoded.  It's  also
                                   useful  in  countering  evasion, which is a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal  characters.  For example, ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE -  Decode  the  following
                                   ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n
                                   , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,  \xHH
                                   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO  (octal).  Encodings
                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace HTML-encoded
                                   characters   with   unencoded   characters.
                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  these  opera-
                                   tions:

                               o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                               o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking
                                 space, decimal 160

                               o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a "less than"
                                 symbol

                               o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with
                                 the corresponding characters

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 decimal  format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the
                                 corresponding characters
                                   JS_DECODE - Decode  JavaScript  escape  se-
                                   quences.  If  a  \   u  HHHH code is in the
                                   full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E  ,
                                   then  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                   adjust the lower byte.  If  not,  only  the
                                   lower  byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from  the  data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE - Specify NONE if you don't  want  any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove multiple slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references  that are not at the begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the  same  as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but first converts back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL  bytes  from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each occurrence
                                   of a C-style comment (/* ... */  )  with  a
                                   single  space.  Multiple consecutive occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments  are  also  replaced  with a space
                                   (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone  termi-
                                   nation  of  a  comment  (*/  ) is not acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS - Replace NULL bytes  in  the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Exam-
                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the higher byte is
                                   used to detect and adjust the  lower  byte.
                                   Otherwise,  only the lower byte is used and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter  sequences to Unicode. This helps input
                                   normalization, and  minimizing  false-posi-
                                   tives  and  false-negatives for non-English
                                   languages.

                     PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                        The area within the portion of the  web  request  that
                        you want WAF to search for SearchString . Valid values
                        include the following:
                            CONTAINS

                        The specified part of the web request must include the
                        value  of SearchString , but the location doesn't mat-
                        ter.
                            CONTAINS_WORD

                        The specified part of the web request must include the
                        value  of SearchString , and SearchString must contain
                        only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z,  a-z,
                        0-9,  or _). In addition, SearchString must be a word,
                        which means that both of the following are true:

                        o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the  specified
                          part  of the web request or is preceded by a charac-
                          ter other than an alphanumeric character  or  under-
                          score  (_).  Examples  include the value of a header
                          and ;BadBot .

                        o SearchString is at the end of the specified part  of
                          the  web request or is followed by a character other
                          than an alphanumeric character  or  underscore  (_),
                          for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                            EXACTLY

                        The  value  of  the  specified part of the web request
                        must exactly match the value of SearchString .
                            STARTS_WITH

                        The value of SearchString must appear at the beginning
                        of the specified part of the web request.
                            ENDS_WITH

                        The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the end of
                        the specified part of the web request.

                 SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that inspects for  malicious  SQL  code.
                     Attackers  insert malicious SQL code into web requests to
                     do things like modify your database or extract data  from
                     it.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle  oversized request bodies, see the Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates  the
                            type  of  operation that the request is asking the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately  follows  the request headers. This is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data  that  you want to send to your web server as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle oversized request bodies, see the Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  All  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if it fails to completely
                               parse the JSON body. The options are  the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain text. WAF applies the text  transforma-
                                 tions  and  inspection  criteria that you de-
                                 fined for the JSON  inspection  to  the  body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If you don't provide this setting,  WAF  parses
                               and  evaluates the content only up to the first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF does its best  to  parse  the  entire  JSON
                               body,  but  might be forced to stop for reasons
                               such as  invalid  characters,  duplicate  keys,
                               truncation,  and  any  content  whose root node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF parses the JSON in the  following  examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify All , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the headers  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not support inspecting the entire  contents  of
                               request  headers  when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192
                               bytes) or 200  total  headers.  The  underlying
                               host  service forwards a maximum of 200 headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  - Inspect the headers normally, ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            cookies  and  only  the first 200 cookies are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "IncludedCook-
                               ies": {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToInclude2",  "Key-
                               ToInclude3"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify All ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the cookies  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not support inspecting the entire  contents  of
                               request  cookies  when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192
                               bytes) or 200  total  cookies.  The  underlying
                               host  service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies
                               and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  - Inspect the cookies normally, ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of the unusual
                        formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in  an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations in a rule statement, WAF performs  all
                        transformations  on  the content of the request compo-
                        nent identified by FieldToMatch ,  starting  from  the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations  that  are  defined  for a rule
                               statement. WAF processes  all  transformations,
                               from  lowest  priority  to  highest, before in-
                               specting the transformed content.  The  priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You can specify  the  following  transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode  a Base64 -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode  a  Base64  -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation that ignores characters that  aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line command and use  unusual  for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-
                                   mand.

                               o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                               o Delete spaces before  the  following  charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace   the  following  characters  with  a
                                 space: , ;

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to  lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  - Replace these char-
                                   acters with a space character (decimal 32):

                               o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters that were
                                   encoded using CSS  2.x  escape  rules  syn-
                                   data.html#characters  .  This function uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it  can  help  to  uncover ASCII characters
                                   that were encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                   wouldnt  typically  be  encoded.  It's also
                                   useful in countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal characters. For  example,  ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the following
                                   ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,  \n
                                   ,  \r  , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" , \xHH
                                   (hexadecimal),  \0OOO  (octal).   Encodings
                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE -  Replace  HTML-encoded
                                   characters   with   unencoded   characters.
                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  these  opera-
                                   tions:

                               o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                               o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking
                                 space, decimal 160

                               o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less  than"
                                 symbol

                               o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                               o Replaces  characters  that are represented in
                                 hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with
                                 the corresponding characters

                               o Replaces  characters  that are represented in
                                 decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with  the
                                 corresponding characters
                                   JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript escape se-
                                   quences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in  the
                                   full-width  ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                   then the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                   adjust  the  lower  byte.  If not, only the
                                   lower byte is used and the higher  byte  is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5  -  Calculate an MD5 hash from the data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE  -  Specify NONE if you don't want any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple  slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references that are not at the  begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is the same as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH , but first  converts  back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove all NULL bytes from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  occurrence
                                   of  a  C-style  comment (/* ... */ ) with a
                                   single space. Multiple  consecutive  occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments are also  replaced  with  a  space
                                   (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone termi-
                                   nation of a comment  (*/  )  is  not  acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes in the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Exam-
                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range of FF01-FF5E ,  the  higher  byte  is
                                   used  to  detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                   Otherwise, only the lower byte is used  and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter sequences to Unicode. This helps  input
                                   normalization,  and  minimizing false-posi-
                                   tives and false-negatives  for  non-English

                     SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                        The  sensitivity  that  you want WAF to use to inspect
                        for SQL injection attacks.
                            HIGH detects more attacks, but might generate more
                            false  positives,  especially if your web requests
                            frequently contain unusual strings.  For  informa-
                            tion  about identifying and mitigating false posi-
                            tives, see Testing and tuning in the WAF Developer
                            Guide .

                            LOW  is  generally  a  better choice for resources
                            that already have other  protections  against  SQL
                            injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for
                            false positives.

                        Default: LOW

                 XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that inspects for  cross-site  scripting
                     (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnera-
                     bilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject mali-
                     cious  client-site  scripts  into  other  legitimate  web
                     browsers.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The part of the web request that you want WAF  to  in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name of the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately, you can filter and inspect all  head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a single query argument. Provide the name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or  SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part of
                            the web request that identifies  a  resource,  for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  query  string. This is the part of a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as plain  text.  The  re-
                            quest  body  immediately follows the request head-
                            ers. This is the part of a request  that  contains
                            any  additional data that you want to send to your
                            web server as the HTTP request body, such as  data
                            from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see  the  Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF
                               inspects the results of these  pattern  matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match  all of the elements. See also Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide  the  include  paths   using   JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]  .
                                   For  information about this syntax, see the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-

                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't  use  this  option  to include all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the JSON to  match  against  using
                               the  MatchPattern  .  If  you specify All , WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  headers. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Headers
                            object,  to  define  the set of headers to and the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            headers  and  only  the first 200 headers are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,  WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request headers when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  headers. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the headers normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-
                               ies":  {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToInclude2", "Key-
                               ToInclude3"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the cookies to inspect with the
                               rule inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request cookies when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  cookies. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  cookies
                               and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the cookies normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations  in a rule statement, WAF performs all
                        transformations on the content of the  request  compo-
                        nent  identified  by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations that are  defined  for  a  rule
                               statement.  WAF  processes all transformations,
                               from lowest priority  to  highest,  before  in-
                               specting  the  transformed content. The priori-
                               ties don't need to  be  consecutive,  but  they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You  can  specify  the following transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64  -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -  Decode  a Base64 -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation  that ignores characters that aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line  command  and use unusual for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-
                                   mand.

                               o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                               o Delete  spaces  before  the following charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace  the  following  characters  with   a
                                 space: , ;

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert  uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these  char-
                                   acters with a space character (decimal 32):

                               o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE - Decode  characters  that  were
                                   encoded  using  CSS  2.x  escape rules syn-
                                   data.html#characters . This  function  uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it can help  to  uncover  ASCII  characters
                                   that  were  encoded using CSS encoding that
                                   wouldnt typically  be  encoded.  It's  also
                                   useful  in  countering  evasion, which is a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal  characters.  For example, ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE -  Decode  the  following
                                   ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n
                                   , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,  \xHH
                                   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO  (octal).  Encodings
                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace HTML-encoded
                                   characters   with   unencoded   characters.
                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  these  opera-
                                   tions:

                               o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                               o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking
                                 space, decimal 160

                               o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a "less than"

                               o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with
                                 the corresponding characters

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 decimal  format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the

                                   JS_DECODE - Decode  JavaScript  escape  se-
                                   quences.  If  a  \   u  HHHH code is in the
                                   full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E  ,
                                   then  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                   adjust the lower byte.  If  not,  only  the
                                   lower  byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from  the  data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE - Specify NONE if you don't  want  any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove multiple slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references  that are not at the begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the  same  as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but first converts back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL  bytes  from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each occurrence
                                   of a C-style comment (/* ... */  )  with  a
                                   single  space.  Multiple consecutive occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments  are  also  replaced  with a space
                                   (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone  termi-
                                   nation  of  a  comment  (*/  ) is not acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS - Replace NULL bytes  in  the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Exam-
                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the higher byte is
                                   used to detect and adjust the  lower  byte.
                                   Otherwise,  only the lower byte is used and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter  sequences to Unicode. This helps input
                                   normalization, and  minimizing  false-posi-
                                   tives  and  false-negatives for non-English
                                   languages.

                 SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that compares a number of bytes  against
                     the size of a request component, using a comparison oper-
                     ator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For  ex-
                     ample,  you  can  use a size constraint statement to look
                     for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                     If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF in-
                     spects  only  the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the request
                     body for your web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes,  you
                     could  use  a size constraint statement to block requests
                     that have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                     If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to
                     filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one charac-
                     ter. For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine  characters
                     long.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle  oversized request bodies, see the Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates  the
                            type  of  operation that the request is asking the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately  follows  the request headers. This is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data  that  you want to send to your web server as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle oversized request bodies, see the Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  All  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if it fails to completely
                               parse the JSON body. The options are  the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain text. WAF applies the text  transforma-
                                 tions  and  inspection  criteria that you de-
                                 fined for the JSON  inspection  to  the  body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If you don't provide this setting,  WAF  parses
                               and  evaluates the content only up to the first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF does its best  to  parse  the  entire  JSON
                               body,  but  might be forced to stop for reasons
                               such as  invalid  characters,  duplicate  keys,
                               truncation,  and  any  content  whose root node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF parses the JSON in the  following  examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify All , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the headers  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not support inspecting the entire  contents  of
                               request  headers  when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192
                               bytes) or 200  total  headers.  The  underlying
                               host  service forwards a maximum of 200 headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  - Inspect the headers normally, ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            cookies  and  only  the first 200 cookies are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "IncludedCook-

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify All ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the cookies  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not support inspecting the entire  contents  of
                               request  cookies  when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192

                               host  service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies
                               and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  - Inspect the cookies normally, ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator to use to compare the request part to the
                        size setting.

                     Size -> (long)
                        The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, af-
                        ter any transformations.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of the unusual
                        formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in  an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations in a rule statement, WAF performs  all
                        transformations  on  the content of the request compo-
                        nent identified by FieldToMatch ,  starting  from  the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations  that  are  defined  for a rule
                               statement. WAF processes  all  transformations,
                               from  lowest  priority  to  highest, before in-
                               specting the transformed content.  The  priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You can specify  the  following  transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode  a Base64 -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode  a  Base64  -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation that ignores characters that  aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line command and use  unusual  for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-

                               o Delete spaces before  the  following  charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace   the  following  characters  with  a

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to  lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  - Replace these char-

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters that were
                                   encoded using CSS  2.x  escape  rules  syn-
                                   data.html#characters  .  This function uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it  can  help  to  uncover ASCII characters
                                   that were encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                   wouldnt  typically  be  encoded.  It's also
                                   useful in countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal characters. For  example,  ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the following
                                   ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,  \n
                                   ,  \r  , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" , \xHH
                                   (hexadecimal),  \0OOO  (octal).   Encodings
                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE -  Replace  HTML-encoded
                                   characters   with   unencoded   characters.
                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  these  opera-
                                   tions:

                               o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                               o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking
                                 space, decimal 160

                               o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less  than"
                                 symbol

                               o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                               o Replaces  characters  that are represented in
                                 hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with
                                 the corresponding characters

                               o Replaces  characters  that are represented in
                                 decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with  the
                                 corresponding characters
                                   JS_DECODE  -  Decode  JavaScript escape se-
                                   quences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is  in  the
                                   full-width  ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E ,
                                   then the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                   adjust  the  lower  byte.  If not, only the
                                   lower byte is used and the higher  byte  is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5  -  Calculate an MD5 hash from the data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE  -  Specify NONE if you don't want any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple  slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references that are not at the  begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is the same as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH , but first  converts  back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove all NULL bytes from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  occurrence
                                   of  a  C-style  comment (/* ... */ ) with a
                                   single space. Multiple  consecutive  occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments are also  replaced  with  a  space
                                   (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone termi-
                                   nation of a comment  (*/  )  is  not  acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes in the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Exam-
                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range of FF01-FF5E ,  the  higher  byte  is
                                   used  to  detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                   Otherwise, only the lower byte is used  and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter sequences to Unicode. This helps  input
                                   normalization,  and  minimizing false-posi-
                                   tives and false-negatives  for  non-English
                                   languages.

                 GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule statement that labels web requests by country and
                     region and that matches against  web  requests  based  on
                     country  code. A geo match rule labels every request that
                     it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

                     o To manage requests only by country, you  can  use  this
                       statement  by itself and specify the countries that you
                       want to match against in the CountryCodes array.

                     o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count ac-
                       tion  so that it only labels requests. Then, add one or
                       more label match rules to run after the geo match  rule
                       and  configure them to match against the geographic la-
                       bels and handle the requests as needed.

                     WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and  region
                     codes  from  the International Organization for Standard-
                     ization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes us-
                     ing  either  the IP address in the web request origin or,
                     if you specify it, the address  in  the  geo  match  For-
                     wardedIPConfig .

                     If  you use the web request origin, the label formats are
                     awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region
                     code>  and awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country code>
                     .

                     If you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats  are
                     awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO re-
                     gion code> and awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO  coun-
                     try code> .

                     For  additional details, see Geographic match rule state-
                     ment in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     CountryCodes -> (list)
                        An array of two-character country codes that you  want
                        to  match  against, for example, [ "US", "CN" ] , from
                        the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                        tional standard.

                        When you use a geo match statement just for the region
                        and country labels that it adds to requests, you still
                        have  to  supply a country code for the rule to evalu-
                        ate. In this case, you  configure  the  rule  to  only
                        count  matching  requests,  but it will still generate
                        logging and count metrics for any matches. You can re-
                        duce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by
                        specifying a country that's unlikely to be a source of
                        traffic to your site.

                        (string)

                     ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  for  inspecting IP addresses in an
                        HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the  IP
                        address  that's  reported  by  the web request origin.
                        Commonly, this is the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If  the  specified header isn't present in the re-
                            quest, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web  re-
                            quest at all.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The  name of the HTTP header to use for the IP ad-
                            dress. For example,  to  use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The  match  status to assign to the web request if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                 RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to run the rules that  are  defined
                     in  a   RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule group with
                     your rules, then provide the ARN of  the  rule  group  in
                     this statement.

                     You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for exam-
                     ple for use inside a NotStatement or  OrStatement  .  You
                     can  only use a rule group reference statement at the top
                     level inside a web ACL.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                     ExcludedRules -> (list)
                        Rules in the referenced rule group whose  actions  are
                        set to Count .

                        NOTE:
                            Instead  of this option, use RuleActionOverrides .
                            It accepts any  valid  action  setting,  including
                            Count .

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a single rule in a rule group whose ac-
                            tion you want to override to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               .  It accepts any valid action setting, includ-
                               ing Count .

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the rule whose action you  want  to
                               override to Count .

                     RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                        Action  settings  to  use in the place of the rule ac-
                        tions that are configured inside the rule  group.  You
                        specify  one  override  for each rule whose action you

                        You can use overrides for testing, for example you can
                        override all of rule actions to Count and then monitor
                        the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule
                        group would handle your web traffic. You can also per-
                        manently override some or all actions, to  modify  how
                        the rule group manages your web traffic.

                            specify  one  override  for each rule whose action

                 IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule statement used to detect web requests coming from
                     particular IP addresses or address ranges. To  use  this,
                     create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to
                     detect, then use the ARN of that set in  this  statement.
                     To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                     Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You cre-
                     ate and maintain the set independent of your rules.  This
                     allows  you to use the single set in multiple rules. When
                     you update the referenced set, WAF automatically  updates
                     all rules that reference it.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this
                        statement references.

                     IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in  an
                        HTTP  header that you specify, instead of using the IP
                        address that's reported by  the  web  request  origin.
                        Commonly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If the specified header isn't present in  the  re-
                            quest,  WAF  doesn't apply the rule to the web re-
                            quest at all.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP  ad-
                            dress.  For  example,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The match status to assign to the web  request  if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                        Position -> (string)
                            The  position  in  the header to search for the IP
                            address. The header can contain  IP  addresses  of
                            the original client and also of proxies. For exam-
                            ple,  the  header   value   could   be   10.1.1.1,
                            127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10 where the first IP address
                            identifies the original client and the rest  iden-
                            tify proxies that the request went through.

                            The options for this setting are the following:

                            o FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list
                              of IP addresses in the header. This  is  usually
                              the client's original IP.

                            o LAST  -  Inspect the last IP address in the list
                              of IP addresses in the header.

                            o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for
                              a  match. If the header contains more than 10 IP
                              addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

                 RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to search  web  request  components
                     for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create
                     a  RegexPatternSet that specifies  the  expressions  that
                     you  want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in this
                     statement. A web request matches  the  pattern  set  rule
                     statement  if  the  request  component matches any of the
                     patterns in the set. To create a regex pattern  set,  see
                     CreateRegexPatternSet .

                     Each  regex pattern set rule statement references a regex
                     pattern set. You create and maintain the set  independent
                     of  your  rules. This allows you to use the single set in
                     multiple rules. When you update the referenced  set,  WAF
                     automatically updates all rules that reference it.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet
                        that this statement references.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The part of the web request that you want WAF  to  in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name of the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately, you can filter and inspect all  head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect  a single query argument. Provide the name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or  SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                            Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part of
                            the web request that identifies  a  resource,  for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  query  string. This is the part of a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as plain  text.  The  re-
                            quest  body  immediately follows the request head-
                            ers. This is the part of a request  that  contains
                            any  additional data that you want to send to your
                            web server as the HTTP request body, such as  data
                            from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see  the  Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                            body are forwarded to WAF for  inspection  by  the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to handle oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF
                               inspects the results of these  pattern  matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match  all of the elements. See also Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide  the  include  paths   using   JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]  .
                                   For  information about this syntax, see the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-

                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't  use  this  option  to include all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the JSON to  match  against  using
                               the  MatchPattern  .  If  you specify All , WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing  the  entire  contents of the body of a web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                               service.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  headers. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Headers
                            object,  to  define  the set of headers to and the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            headers  and  only  the first 200 headers are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the headers whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,  WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request headers when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  headers. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the headers normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-
                               ies":  {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToInclude2", "Key-
                               ToInclude3"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies that  have  a  key
                                   that  matches  one of the strings specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect only the cookies whose  keys  don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the cookies to inspect with the
                               rule inspection criteria. If you specify All  ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not  support  inspecting the entire contents of
                               request cookies when they  exceed  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes)  or  200  total  cookies. The underlying
                               host service forwards a maximum of 200  cookies
                               and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the cookies normally,  ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations  in a rule statement, WAF performs all
                        transformations on the content of the  request  compo-
                        nent  identified  by  FieldToMatch , starting from the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations that are  defined  for  a  rule
                               statement.  WAF  processes all transformations,
                               from lowest priority  to  highest,  before  in-
                               specting  the  transformed content. The priori-
                               ties don't need to  be  consecutive,  but  they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You  can  specify  the following transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64  -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -  Decode  a Base64 -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation  that ignores characters that aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line  command  and use unusual for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-
                                   mand.

                               o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                               o Delete  spaces  before  the following charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace  the  following  characters  with   a
                                 space: , ;

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert  uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these  char-
                                   acters with a space character (decimal 32):

                               o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE - Decode  characters  that  were
                                   encoded  using  CSS  2.x  escape rules syn-
                                   data.html#characters . This  function  uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it can help  to  uncover  ASCII  characters
                                   that  were  encoded using CSS encoding that
                                   wouldnt typically  be  encoded.  It's  also
                                   useful  in  countering  evasion, which is a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal  characters.  For example, ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE -  Decode  the  following
                                   ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f , \n
                                   , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,  \xHH
                                   (hexadecimal),   \0OOO  (octal).  Encodings
                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace HTML-encoded
                                   characters   with   unencoded   characters.
                                   HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  these  opera-
                                   tions:

                               o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                               o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking
                                 space, decimal 160

                               o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a "less than"
                                 symbol

                               o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with
                                 the corresponding characters

                               o Replaces characters that are  represented  in
                                 decimal  format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the
                                 corresponding characters
                                   JS_DECODE - Decode  JavaScript  escape  se-
                                   quences.  If  a  \   u  HHHH code is in the
                                   full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E  ,
                                   then  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                   adjust the lower byte.  If  not,  only  the
                                   lower  byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from  the  data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE - Specify NONE if you don't  want  any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove multiple slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references  that are not at the begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the  same  as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but first converts back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL  bytes  from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each occurrence
                                   of a C-style comment (/* ... */  )  with  a
                                   single  space.  Multiple consecutive occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments  are  also  replaced  with a space
                                   (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone  termi-
                                   nation  of  a  comment  (*/  ) is not acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS - Replace NULL bytes  in  the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode SQL hex data. Exam-
                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the higher byte is
                                   used to detect and adjust the  lower  byte.
                                   Otherwise,  only the lower byte is used and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter  sequences to Unicode. This helps input
                                   normalization, and  minimizing  false-posi-
                                   tives  and  false-negatives for non-English

                     A rate-based rule tracks the rate of  requests  for  each
                     originating IP address, and triggers the rule action when
                     the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on  the  number
                     of  requests  in any 5-minute time span. You can use this
                     to put a temporary block on requests from an  IP  address
                     that is sending excessive requests.

                     WAF  tracks  and manages web requests separately for each
                     instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For  example,
                     if  you  provide the same rate-based rule settings in two
                     web ACLs, each of the two rule  statements  represents  a
                     separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own
                     tracking  and  management  by  WAF.  If  you   define   a
                     rate-based  rule  inside  a rule group, and then use that
                     rule group in multiple places, each use creates  a  sepa-
                     rate  instance  of  the rate-based rule that gets its own
                     tracking and management by WAF.

                     When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional  re-
                     quests  from  the IP address until the request rate falls
                     below the limit.

                     You can optionally  nest  another  statement  inside  the
                     rate-based  statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so
                     that it only counts requests that match the nested state-
                     ment. For example, based on recent requests that you have
                     seen from an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule
                     with  a  nested AND rule statement that contains the fol-
                     lowing nested statements:

                     o An IP match statement with an IP set that specifies the
                       address 192.0.2.44.

                     o A   string   match   statement  that  searches  in  the
                       User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                     In this rate-based rule, you also define  a  rate  limit.
                     For  this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that
                     meet the criteria of both of the  nested  statements  are
                     counted.  If  the  count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five
                     minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that  do  not
                     meet  the  criteria  of both of the nested statements are
                     not counted towards the rate limit and are  not  affected
                     by this rule.

                     You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement  inside  another
                     statement, for example inside a NotStatement or  OrState-
                     ment  .  You can define a RateBasedStatement inside a web
                     ACL and inside a rule group.

                     Limit -> (long)
                        The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a single
                        originating  IP  address.  If the statement includes a
                        ScopeDownStatement , this limit is applied only to the
                        requests that match the statement.

                     AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                        Setting  that  indicates  how to aggregate the request
                        counts. The options are the following:

                        o IP - Aggregate the request counts on the IP  address
                          from the web request origin.

                        o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts on the
                          first IP address in an HTTP header. If you use this,
                          configure  the  ForwardedIPConfig  ,  to specify the
                          header to use.

                     ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                        An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of
                        the  web requests that are evaluated by the rate-based
                        statement. Requests are only tracked by the rate-based
                        statement  if they match the scope-down statement. You
                        can use any  nestable   Statement  in  the  scope-down
                        statement,  and  you can nest statements at any level,
                        the same as you can for a rule statement.

                        ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string  match
                            search  for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte
                            match statement provides the bytes to search  for,
                            the  location  in  requests  that  you want WAF to
                            search, and other settings. The  bytes  to  search
                            for  are  typically a string that corresponds with
                            ASCII characters. In the WAF console and  the  de-
                            veloper  guide,  this  is  called  a  string match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF  searches  only in the part of web requests
                               that you designate for  inspection  in   Field-
                               ToMatch  .  The  maximum length of the value is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid values depend on the component  that  you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath  :  The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               If  SearchString includes alphabetic characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value.
                               The maximum length  of  the  value  before  you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For  example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you  want  to  search the User-Agent header for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing  MIME  base64-encoding  and include the re-
                               sulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value  of
                               SearchString .
                                   If  you're using the CLI or one of the Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The value that you want WAF to search for.  The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": {"KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToIn-
                                      clude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  cookies  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal cookies. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at
                                      most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the cookies nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The  area within the portion of the web request
                               that you want WAF to search for SearchString  .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString ,  and  Search-
                               String  must  contain only alphanumeric charac-
                               ters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,  or  _).  In
                               addition,  SearchString  must  be a word, which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified  part of the web request or is preceded
                                 by a character  other  than  an  alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString is at the end of  the  specified
                                 part  of  the web request or is followed by a
                                 character other than an alphanumeric  charac-
                                 ter  or  underscore (_), for example, BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The value of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest  must  exactly match the value of Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               beginning  of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that inspects for malicious SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders":  {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the headers nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": {"KeyToInclude1",  "KeyToIn-
                                      clude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request cookies when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal cookies. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at
                                      most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  cookies  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify one or more transformations in  a  rule
                               statement,  WAF performs all transformations on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority setting, before  inspecting  the  content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations  that  are de-
                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-
                                      cesses  all transformations, from lowest
                                      priority to highest,  before  inspecting
                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE - Command-line  transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness of attackers  who  in-
                                          ject   an   operating   system  com-
                                          mand-line command  and  use  unusual
                                          formatting  to  disguise some or all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace the following characters  with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented in hexadecimal format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple

                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate more  false  positives,  especially  if
                                   your  web  requests  frequently contain un-
                                   usual strings. For information about  iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see
                                   Testing and tuning  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   LOW  is  generally  a better choice for re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against  SQL injection attacks or that have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  inspects  for  cross-site
                            scripting  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a  vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request  bodies,  see  the  JsonBody object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders":  {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the headers nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": {"KeyToInclude1",  "KeyToIn-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings

                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request cookies when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal cookies. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at
                                      most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  cookies  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify one or more transformations in  a  rule
                               statement,  WAF performs all transformations on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority setting, before  inspecting  the  content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations  that  are de-
                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-
                                      cesses  all transformations, from lowest
                                      priority to highest,  before  inspecting
                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE - Command-line  transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness of attackers  who  in-
                                          ject   an   operating   system  com-
                                          mand-line command  and  use  unusual
                                          formatting  to  disguise some or all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace the following characters  with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented in hexadecimal format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple
                                          slashes, directory  self-references,
                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that compares a number  of  bytes
                            against  the  size of a request component, using a
                            comparison operator, such as greater than  (>)  or
                            less  than  (<).  For  example, you can use a size
                            constraint statement to  look  for  query  strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If  you configure WAF to inspect the request body,
                            WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB).  If
                            the  request  body for your web requests never ex-
                            ceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size  constraint
                            statement  to  block  requests that have a request
                            body greater than 8192 bytes.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest  to  filter  on,  the  slash  (/) in the URI
                            counts as one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text

                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": {"KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-

                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes

                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try and region and that matches  against  web  re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels every request that it inspects regardless  of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To  manage requests only by country, you can use
                              this statement by itself and specify  the  coun-
                              tries  that  you  want  to  match against in the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise, configure your geo  match  rule  with
                              Count  action  so  that it only labels requests.
                              Then, add one or more label match rules  to  run
                              after  the  geo match rule and configure them to
                              match against the geographic labels  and  handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and
                            region codes from the  International  Organization
                            for  Standardization  (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF de-
                            termines the codes using either the IP address  in
                            the  web request origin or, if you specify it, the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If you use the web request origin, the label  for-
                            mats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country
                            code>-<ISO   region   code>   and    awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label for-
                            mats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO  coun-
                            try   code>-<ISO   region  code>  and  awswaf:for-
                            wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            For additional details, see Geographic match  rule
                            statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An  array  of  two-character country codes that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN"  ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region  and  country labels that it adds to re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for  the  rule  to  evaluate. In this case, you
                               configure the rule to only count  matching  re-
                               quests,  but it will still generate logging and
                               count metrics for any matches. You  can  reduce
                               the  logging and metrics that the rule produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a
                            rule  group  with your rules, then provide the ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,
                            for  example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement or
                            OrStatement . You can only use a rule group refer-
                            ence statement at the top level inside a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions that are  configured  inside  the  rule
                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                               (structure)
                                   Action setting to use in  the  place  of  a
                                   rule  action  that is configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule to override.

                                   ActionToUse -> (structure)
                                      The override action to use, in place  of
                                      the configured action of the rule in the
                                      rule group.

                                      Block -> (structure)
                                          Instructs WAF to block the  web  re-
                                          quest.

                                          CustomResponse -> (structure)
                                             Defines a custom response for the
                                             web request.

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to detect web requests  com-
                            ing   from  particular  IP  addresses  or  address
                            ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that  speci-
                            fies  the  addresses  you want to detect, then use
                            the ARN of that set in this statement.  To  create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set.
                            You create and maintain  the  set  independent  of
                            your  rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the  referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the   IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The  position  in  the header to search for
                                   the IP address. The header can  contain  IP
                                   addresses  of  the original client and also
                                   of proxies. For example, the  header  value
                                   could  be  10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10
                                   where the first IP address  identifies  the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The options for this setting are  the  fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in
                                     the list of IP addresses in  the  header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY - Inspect all  IP  addresses  in  the
                                     header  for  a  match. If the header con-
                                     tains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF  in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions that you want to detect, then use  the
                            ARN  of  that set in this statement. A web request
                            matches the pattern set rule statement if the  re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set. To create a  regex  pattern  set,  see   Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent  of your rules. This allows you to use
                            the single set in multiple rules. When you  update
                            the  referenced set, WAF automatically updates all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-
                                          mentation JavaScript Object Notation
                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-

                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-

                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less

                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for
                            each originating IP address, and triggers the rule
                            action  when  the  rate  exceeds  a limit that you
                            specify on the number of requests in any  5-minute
                            time  span.  You  can  use this to put a temporary
                            block on requests from an IP address that is send-
                            ing excessive requests.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each instance of a rate-based rule that  you  use.
                            For  example,  if  you provide the same rate-based
                            rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of  the  two
                            rule  statements represents a separate instance of
                            the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking  and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside a rule group, and then use that rule  group
                            in  multiple  places,  each use creates a separate
                            instance of the rate-based rule that gets its  own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            When  the  rule  action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                            tional requests from the IP address until the  re-
                            quest rate falls below the limit.

                            You  can  optionally nest another statement inside
                            the rate-based statement, to narrow the  scope  of
                            the  rule  so  that  it  only counts requests that
                            match the nested statement. For example, based  on
                            recent  requests  that  you  have seen from an at-
                            tacker, you might create a rate-based rule with  a
                            nested  AND  rule statement that contains the fol-
                            lowing nested statements:

                            o An IP match statement with an IP set that speci-
                              fies the address 192.0.2.44.

                            o A  string  match  statement that searches in the
                              User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                            In this rate-based rule, you also  define  a  rate
                            limit.  For this example, the rate limit is 1,000.
                            Requests that meet the criteria  of  both  of  the
                            nested  statements  are  counted. If the count ex-
                            ceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,  the  rule
                            action  triggers.  Requests  that  do not meet the
                            criteria of both of the nested statements are  not
                            counted  towards  the  rate  limit and are not af-
                            fected by this rule.

                            You cannot nest a  RateBasedStatement  inside  an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or OrStatement . You can define a  RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single originating IP address. If the statement
                               includes  a  ScopeDownStatement , this limit is
                               applied only to the  requests  that  match  the
                               statement.

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts. The options are the following:

                               o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the  IP
                                 address from the web request origin.

                               o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts
                                 on the first IP address in an HTTP header. If
                                 you use this, configure the ForwardedIPConfig
                                 , to specify the header to use.

                            ( ... recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig ->  (struc-
                            ture)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This is required if AggregateKeyType is set  to
                               FORWARDED_IP .

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the request doesn't have a valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        AndStatement -> (structure)
                            A logical rule statement  used  to  combine  other
                            rule  statements  with AND logic. You provide more
                            than one  Statement within the AndStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The statements to combine with AND  logic.  You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                        OrStatement -> (structure)
                            A  logical  rule  statement  used to combine other
                            rule statements with OR logic.  You  provide  more
                            than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The  statements  to  combine with OR logic. You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                        NotStatement -> (structure)
                            A logical rule statement used to  negate  the  re-
                            sults  of  another rule statement. You provide one
                            Statement within the NotStatement .

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to run the  rules  that  are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the  rule
                            group  in this statement. You can retrieve the re-
                            quired names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRule-
                            Groups .

                            You  cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for
                            example for use inside a NotStatement or  OrState-
                            ment  .  It  can only be referenced as a top-level
                            statement within a rule.

                            NOTE:
                               You are charged additional fees  when  you  use
                               the  WAF Bot Control managed rule group AWSMan-

                            VendorName -> (string)
                               The  name of the managed rule group vendor. You
                               use this, along with the rule  group  name,  to
                               identify the rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use
                               this, along with the vendor name,  to  identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version  of the managed rule group to use.
                               If you specify this,  the  version  setting  is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this, WAF uses the  vendor's  default  version,
                               and  then keeps the version at the vendor's de-
                               fault when the vendor updates the managed  rule
                               group settings.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                                                        The name of the custom
                                                        header.

                                                        For   custom   request
                                                        header insertion, when
                                                        WAF inserts the header
                                                        into  the  request, it
                                                        prefixes   this   name
                                                        x-amzn-waf- , to avoid
                                                        confusion   with   the
                                                        headers  that  are al-
                                                        ready in the  request.
                                                        For  example,  for the
                                                        header name  sample  ,
                                                        WAF inserts the header
                                                        x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                    Value -> (string)
                                                        The value of the  cus-
                                                        tom header.

                        LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement to match against labels that have
                            been added to the web request by rules  that  have
                            already run in the web ACL.

                            The  label  match  statement provides the label or
                            namespace string to search for. The  label  string
                            can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully  qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                            namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added the label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                            qualified  name  in  your  label match string, WAF
                            performs the search for labels that were added  in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-
                               bel name or just the namespace.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The string to match against.  The  setting  you
                               provide  for  this  depends on the match state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If the Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,  then  this
                                 specification  must  include the name and can
                                 include any  number  of  preceding  namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then  this
                                 specification  can include any number of con-
                                 tiguous namespace strings,  and  can  include
                                 the  entire  label  namespace prefix from the
                                 rule group or web ACL where the label  origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels  are  case sensitive and components of a
                               label must be separated by colon,  for  example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                        RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": {"KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToIn-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings

                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  cookies  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal cookies. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and at
                                      most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the cookies nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes

                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-

                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and

                     ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  for  inspecting IP addresses in an
                        HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the  IP
                        address  that's  reported  by  the web request origin.
                        Commonly, this is the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If  the  specified header isn't present in the re-
                            quest, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web  re-
                            quest at all.

                        This  is  required  if AggregateKeyType is set to FOR-
                        WARDED_IP .

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP  ad-
                            dress.  For  example,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The match status to assign to the web  request  if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                 AndStatement -> (structure)
                     A  logical  rule  statement  used  to  combine other rule
                     statements with AND logic.  You  provide  more  than  one
                     Statement within the AndStatement .

                     Statements -> (list)
                        The  statements to combine with AND logic. You can use
                        any statements that can be nested.

                        (structure)
                            The processing guidance for a  Rule , used by  WAF
                            to  determine  whether  a  web request matches the
                            rule.

                            For example specifications, see the examples  sec-
                            tion of  CreateWebACL .

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-

                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest headers when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          "KeyToInclude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  cookies when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system

                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following
                                            characters: / (

                                          o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                                            lowercase (a-z)
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-

                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      JsonBody object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-

                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest headers when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that

                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the

                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system

                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             , but  with  support  for  Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the

                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all

                               SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                                   The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to
                                   inspect for SQL injection attacks.
                                      HIGH  detects  more  attacks,  but might
                                      generate  more  false  positives,  espe-
                                      cially  if  your web requests frequently
                                      contain unusual strings. For information

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources that already have other  protec-
                                      tions  against  SQL injection attacks or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement that inspects for cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) attacks. In  XSS  attacks,  the
                               attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign web-
                               site  as  a   vehicle   to   inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest cookies when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following
                                            characters: / (

                                            with a space: , ;

                                          o Replace  multiple  spaces with one

                                          o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                                            lowercase (a-z)
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   also   re-
                                             places multiple spaces  with  one

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that were encoded using  CSS  2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-
                                             cover  ASCII characters that were
                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             tal). Encodings that aren't valid
                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase
                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash  from
                                             the  data  in the input. The com-

                                             form.

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple
                                             slashes,   directory  self-refer-
                                             ences, and directory  back-refer-

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.

                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL

                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,  but  with  support  for Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion,  and minimizing false-posi-
                                             tives  and  false-negatives   for
                                             non-English languages.

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB). If the request body for your web  requests
                               never  exceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size
                               constraint statement  to  block  requests  that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-

                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-
                                          cludedCookies":    {"KeyToInclude1",
                                          "KeyToInclude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest cookies when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,

                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that labels web requests by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests  based  on  country  code. A geo match
                               rule labels every request that it inspects  re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To  manage  requests only by country, you can
                                 use this statement by itself and specify  the
                                 countries  that  you want to match against in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then, add one or more label  match  rules  to
                                 run  after  the  geo match rule and configure
                                 them to match against the  geographic  labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF  labels  requests using the alpha-2 country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF determines the codes using  either  the  IP
                               address  in  the  web request origin or, if you
                               specify it, the address in the geo  match  For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If  you  use  the web request origin, the label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If you use a forwarded IP  address,  the  label
                               formats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array  of  two-character  country  codes
                                   that  you  want to match against, for exam-
                                   ple, [ "US", "CN"  ]  ,  from  the  alpha-2
                                   country  ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the  region and country labels that it adds
                                   to requests, you still  have  to  supply  a
                                   country  code  for the rule to evaluate. In
                                   this case, you configure the rule  to  only
                                   count  matching requests, but it will still
                                   generate logging and count metrics for  any

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You can only  use  a  rule  group
                               reference  statement  at the top level inside a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group

                               RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                   Action  settings to use in the place of the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule  group.  You  specify one override for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You can use overrides for testing, for  ex-
                                   ample  you can override all of rule actions

                                   count  metrics  to  understand how the rule
                                   group would handle your  web  traffic.  You
                                   can  also  permanently override some or all
                                   actions, to modify how the rule group  man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest headers when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          "KeyToInclude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  cookies when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores  characters   that   aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system
                                             command-line  command and use un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following
                                            characters: / (

                                          o Replace  the  following characters
                                            with a space: , ;

                                          o Replace multiple spaces  with  one
                                            space

                                          o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                                            lowercase (a-z)
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                          o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                          o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                          o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                          o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   also   re-
                                             places  multiple  spaces with one
                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-
                                             cover ASCII characters that  were
                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on requests from an IP ad-
                               dress that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You  can  optionally nest another statement in-
                               side the rate-based statement,  to  narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule so that it only counts re-
                               quests that match the nested statement. For ex-
                               ample,  based  on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specifies the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests that meet the criteria of both
                               of the nested statements are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  the criteria of both of the nested state-
                               ments are not counted towards  the  rate  limit
                               and are not affected by this rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine  with  OR  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to negate the re-
                               sults  of  another  rule statement. You provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               NOTE:
                                   You are charged additional  fees  when  you
                                   use  the WAF Bot Control managed rule group
                                   AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet or the WAF
                                   Fraud  Control  account takeover prevention

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules in the referenced  rule  group  whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement to match against  labels  that
                               have  been  added  to  the web request by rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space  specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)

                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the
                                      JsonBody object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that

                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-

                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-

                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                 OrStatement -> (structure)
                     A  logical  rule  statement  used  to  combine other rule
                     statements with OR  logic.  You  provide  more  than  one
                     Statement within the OrStatement .

                     Statements -> (list)
                        The  statements  to combine with OR logic. You can use
                        any statements that can be nested.

                        (structure)
                            The processing guidance for a  Rule , used by  WAF
                            to  determine  whether  a  web request matches the
                            rule.

                            For example specifications, see the examples  sec-
                            tion of  CreateWebACL .

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-

                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest headers when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  cookies when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores  characters   that   aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system
                                             command-line  command and use un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following
                                            characters: / (

                                            with a space: , ;

                                          o Replace multiple spaces  with  one
                                            space

                                          o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                                            lowercase (a-z)
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                          o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                          o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                          o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                          o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   also   re-
                                             places  multiple  spaces with one
                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters  .  This function uses up to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-
                                             cover ASCII characters that  were
                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the
                                             following  ANSI  C   escape   se-
                                             quences: \a , \b , \f , \n , \r ,

                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-

                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define

                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of

                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must

                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the

                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-

                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to

                                      cially  if  your web requests frequently

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources that already have other  protec-
                                      tions  against  SQL injection attacks or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement that inspects for cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) attacks. In  XSS  attacks,  the
                               attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign web-
                               site  as  a   vehicle   to   inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of

                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest cookies when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some

                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-
                                             cover  ASCII characters that were
                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,  but  with  support  for Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB). If the request body for your web  requests
                               never  exceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size
                               constraint statement  to  block  requests  that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-
                                      dle  oversized  request  bodies, see the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the
                                      request body are forwarded  to  WAF  for
                                      inspection  by  the underlying host ser-
                                      vice. For information about how to  han-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-
                                          cludedCookies":    {"KeyToInclude1",
                                          "KeyToInclude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest cookies when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                          o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                                            lowercase (a-z)
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                          o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                          o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                          o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   also   re-
                                             places multiple spaces  with  one
                                             space.

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that were encoded using  CSS  2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-
                                             cover  ASCII characters that were
                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL
                                             bytes in  the  input  with  space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded

                                             code range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             tion,  and minimizing false-posi-
                                             tives  and  false-negatives   for

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that labels web requests by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests  based  on  country  code. A geo match
                               rule labels every request that it inspects  re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To  manage  requests only by country, you can
                                 use this statement by itself and specify  the
                                 countries  that  you want to match against in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then, add one or more label  match  rules  to
                                 run  after  the  geo match rule and configure
                                 them to match against the  geographic  labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF  labels  requests using the alpha-2 country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF determines the codes using  either  the  IP
                               address  in  the  web request origin or, if you
                               specify it, the address in the geo  match  For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If  you  use  the web request origin, the label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If you use a forwarded IP  address,  the  label
                               formats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               For  additional  details,  see Geographic match
                               rule statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array  of  two-character  country  codes
                                   that  you  want to match against, for exam-
                                   ple, [ "US", "CN"  ]  ,  from  the  alpha-2
                                   country  ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the  region and country labels that it adds
                                   to requests, you still  have  to  supply  a
                                   country  code  for the rule to evaluate. In
                                   this case, you configure the rule  to  only
                                   count  matching requests, but it will still
                                   generate logging and count metrics for  any
                                   matches.  You  can  reduce  the logging and
                                   metrics that the rule produces by  specify-
                                   ing  a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You can only  use  a  rule  group
                               reference  statement  at the top level inside a
                               web ACL.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   rule  group.  You  specify one override for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You can use overrides for testing, for  ex-

                                   group would handle your  web  traffic.  You
                                   can  also  permanently override some or all
                                   actions, to modify how the rule group  man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                                        Value -> (string)

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  the
                                      request  body  are  forwarded to WAF for
                                      inspection by the underlying  host  ser-
                                      vice.  For information about how to han-
                                      dle oversized request  bodies,  see  the
                                      JsonBody object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of the body of a web
                                          request when the body exceeds  8  KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the request body  are  forwarded  to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-
                                            spection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request whose body is over 8 KB.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":    {"KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2"} }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request are larger than WAF can
                                          inspect. WAF does  not  support  in-
                                          specting  the entire contents of re-
                                          quest headers when they exceed 8  KB
                                          (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally, according  to  the  rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  cookies when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  cookies.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 cookies and at most
                                          8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  cookies
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system
                                             command-line  command and use un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-
                                             cover ASCII characters that  were
                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE  -  Convert   uppercase

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a

                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             , but  with  support  for  Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E  , the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on requests from an IP ad-
                               dress that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You  can  optionally nest another statement in-
                               side the rate-based statement,  to  narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule so that it only counts re-
                               quests that match the nested statement. For ex-
                               ample,  based  on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specifies the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests that meet the criteria of both
                               of the nested statements are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  the criteria of both of the nested state-
                               ments are not counted towards  the  rate  limit
                               and are not affected by this rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               NOTE:
                                   You are charged additional  fees  when  you

                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)

                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                                                        Value -> (string)

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement to match against  labels  that
                               have  been  added  to  the web request by rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space  specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)

                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)

                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF

                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect the  body  nor-
                                            mally,  according  to the rule in-

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or

                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-

                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)

                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents of the body of  a  web
                                          request  when  the body exceeds 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of
                                          the  request  body  are forwarded to
                                          WAF by the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body nor-
                                            mally, according to the  rule  in-

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-

                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the

                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          All -> (structure)

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of

                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request are larger than WAF  can
                                          inspect.  WAF  does  not support in-
                                          specting the entire contents of  re-
                                          quest  headers when they exceed 8 KB
                                          (8192 bytes) or 200  total  headers.
                                          The underlying host service forwards
                                          a maximum of 200 headers and at most
                                          8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  headers
                                            normally,  according  to  the rule
                                            inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-

                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the

                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-

                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                            match statement provides the bytes to search  for,
                            the  location  in  requests  that  you want WAF to
                            search, and other settings. The  bytes  to  search
                            for  are  typically a string that corresponds with
                            ASCII characters. In the WAF console and  the  de-
                            veloper  guide,  this  is  called  a  string match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF  searches  only in the part of web requests
                               that you designate for  inspection  in   Field-
                               ToMatch  .  The  maximum length of the value is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid values depend on the component  that  you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath  :  The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               If  SearchString includes alphabetic characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value.
                               The maximum length  of  the  value  before  you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For  example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you  want  to  search the User-Agent header for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing  MIME  base64-encoding  and include the re-
                               sulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value  of
                               SearchString .
                                   If  you're using the CLI or one of the Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The value that you want WAF to search for.  The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up

                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-

                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-

                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The  area within the portion of the web request
                               that you want WAF to search for SearchString  .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString ,  and  Search-
                               String  must  contain only alphanumeric charac-
                               ters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,  or  _).  In
                               addition,  SearchString  must  be a word, which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified  part of the web request or is preceded
                                 by a character  other  than  an  alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString is at the end of  the  specified
                                 part  of  the web request or is followed by a
                                 character other than an alphanumeric  charac-
                                 ter  or  underscore (_), for example, BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The value of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest  must  exactly match the value of Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               beginning  of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that inspects for malicious SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request  bodies,  see  the  JsonBody object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire

                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders":  {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the headers nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-

                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations  that  are de-
                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-
                                      cesses  all transformations, from lowest
                                      priority to highest,  before  inspecting
                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE - Command-line  transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness of attackers  who  in-
                                          ject   an   operating   system  com-
                                          mand-line command  and  use  unusual
                                          formatting  to  disguise some or all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace the following characters  with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented in hexadecimal format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple
                                          slashes, directory  self-references,
                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and

                                          guages.

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate more  false  positives,  especially  if
                                   your  web  requests  frequently contain un-
                                   usual strings. For information about  iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see

                                   Guide .

                                   LOW  is  generally  a better choice for re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against  SQL injection attacks or that have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)

                            scripting  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a  vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request  bodies,  see  the  JsonBody object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-
                                          mentation JavaScript Object Notation
                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body

                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify one or more transformations in  a  rule
                               statement,  WAF performs all transformations on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority setting, before  inspecting  the  content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations  that  are de-
                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-

                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-

                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple
                                          slashes, directory  self-references,
                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that compares a number  of  bytes
                            against  the  size of a request component, using a
                            comparison operator, such as greater than  (>)  or
                            less  than  (<).  For  example, you can use a size
                            constraint statement to  look  for  query  strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If  you configure WAF to inspect the request body,
                            WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB).  If
                            the  request  body for your web requests never ex-
                            ceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size  constraint
                            statement  to  block  requests that have a request
                            body greater than 8192 bytes.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest  to  filter  on,  the  slash  (/) in the URI
                            counts as one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of

                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a

                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try and region and that matches  against  web  re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels every request that it inspects regardless  of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To  manage requests only by country, you can use
                              this statement by itself and specify  the  coun-
                              tries  that  you  want  to  match against in the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise, configure your geo  match  rule  with
                              Count  action  so  that it only labels requests.
                              Then, add one or more label match rules  to  run
                              after  the  geo match rule and configure them to
                              match against the geographic labels  and  handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and
                            region codes from the  International  Organization
                            for  Standardization  (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF de-
                            termines the codes using either the IP address  in
                            the  web request origin or, if you specify it, the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If you use the web request origin, the label  for-
                            mats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country
                            code>-<ISO   region   code>   and    awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label for-
                            mats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO  coun-
                            try   code>-<ISO   region  code>  and  awswaf:for-
                            wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            For additional details, see Geographic match  rule
                            statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An  array  of  two-character country codes that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN"  ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region  and  country labels that it adds to re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for  the  rule  to  evaluate. In this case, you
                               configure the rule to only count  matching  re-
                               quests,  but it will still generate logging and
                               count metrics for any matches. You  can  reduce
                               the  logging and metrics that the rule produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a
                            rule  group  with your rules, then provide the ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,
                            for  example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement or
                            OrStatement . You can only use a rule group refer-
                            ence statement at the top level inside a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions that are  configured  inside  the  rule
                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                               (structure)
                                   Action setting to use in  the  place  of  a

                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule to override.

                                                 to the  web  request  client.
                                                 You  can  define a custom re-

                                                 is set to block. To do  this,
                                                 you first define the response
                                                 body key  and  value  in  the

                                             the  request's token is valid and

                                                 (structure)
                                                    A custom header for custom
                                                    request  and response han-

                                                    Name -> (string)
                                                        The name of the custom
                                                        header.

                                                        x-amzn-waf- , to avoid
                                                        confusion   with   the

                                                    Value -> (string)
                                                        The  value of the cus-

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to detect web requests  com-
                            ing   from  particular  IP  addresses  or  address
                            ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that  speci-
                            fies  the  addresses  you want to detect, then use
                            the ARN of that set in this statement.  To  create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set.
                            You create and maintain  the  set  independent  of
                            your  rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the  referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the   IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The  position  in  the header to search for
                                   the IP address. The header can  contain  IP
                                   addresses  of  the original client and also
                                   of proxies. For example, the  header  value
                                   could  be  10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10
                                   where the first IP address  identifies  the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The options for this setting are  the  fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in
                                     the list of IP addresses in  the  header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY - Inspect all  IP  addresses  in  the
                                     header  for  a  match. If the header con-
                                     tains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF  in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions that you want to detect, then use  the
                            ARN  of  that set in this statement. A web request
                            matches the pattern set rule statement if the  re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set. To create a  regex  pattern  set,  see   Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent  of your rules. This allows you to use
                            the single set in multiple rules. When you  update
                            the  referenced set, WAF automatically updates all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  cookies  when

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the cookies nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-

                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a

                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-

                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for
                            each originating IP address, and triggers the rule
                            action  when  the  rate  exceeds  a limit that you
                            specify on the number of requests in any  5-minute
                            time  span.  You  can  use this to put a temporary
                            block on requests from an IP address that is send-
                            ing excessive requests.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each instance of a rate-based rule that  you  use.
                            For  example,  if  you provide the same rate-based
                            rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of  the  two
                            rule  statements represents a separate instance of
                            the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking  and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside a rule group, and then use that rule  group
                            in  multiple  places,  each use creates a separate
                            instance of the rate-based rule that gets its  own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            When  the  rule  action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                            tional requests from the IP address until the  re-
                            quest rate falls below the limit.

                            You  can  optionally nest another statement inside
                            the rate-based statement, to narrow the  scope  of
                            the  rule  so  that  it  only counts requests that
                            match the nested statement. For example, based  on
                            recent  requests  that  you  have seen from an at-
                            tacker, you might create a rate-based rule with  a
                            nested  AND  rule statement that contains the fol-
                            lowing nested statements:

                            o An IP match statement with an IP set that speci-
                              fies the address 192.0.2.44.

                            o A  string  match  statement that searches in the
                              User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                            In this rate-based rule, you also  define  a  rate
                            limit.  For this example, the rate limit is 1,000.
                            Requests that meet the criteria  of  both  of  the
                            nested  statements  are  counted. If the count ex-
                            ceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,  the  rule
                            action  triggers.  Requests  that  do not meet the
                            criteria of both of the nested statements are  not
                            counted  towards  the  rate  limit and are not af-
                            fected by this rule.

                            You cannot nest a  RateBasedStatement  inside  an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or OrStatement . You can define a  RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single originating IP address. If the statement
                               includes  a  ScopeDownStatement , this limit is
                               applied only to the  requests  that  match  the
                               statement.

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts. The options are the following:

                               o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the  IP
                                 address from the web request origin.

                               o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts
                                 on the first IP address in an HTTP header. If
                                 you use this, configure the ForwardedIPConfig
                                 , to specify the header to use.

                            ( ... recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig ->  (struc-
                            ture)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This is required if AggregateKeyType is set  to
                               FORWARDED_IP .

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in

                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        AndStatement -> (structure)
                            A logical rule statement  used  to  combine  other
                            rule  statements  with AND logic. You provide more
                            than one  Statement within the AndStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The statements to combine with AND  logic.  You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to run the  rules  that  are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the  rule
                            group  in this statement. You can retrieve the re-
                            quired names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRule-
                            Groups .

                            VendorName -> (string)
                               The  name of the managed rule group vendor. You
                               use this, along with the rule  group  name,  to
                               identify the rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use
                               this, along with the vendor name,  to  identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version  of the managed rule group to use.
                               If you specify this,  the  version  setting  is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this, WAF uses the  vendor's  default  version,
                               and  then keeps the version at the vendor's de-
                               fault when the vendor updates the managed  rule
                               group settings.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               rule  group. Many managed rule groups don't re-
                               quire this.

                               Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet configuration

                                   managed   rule  group.  Many  managed  rule
                                   groups don't require this.

                                   Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet  configu-
                                   ration object for the account takeover pre-

                                      LoginPath -> (string)
                                          The path of the login  endpoint  for
                                          your  application.  For example, for
                                          the URL  https://example.com/web/lo-
                                          gin  ,  you  would  provide the path

                                      RequestInspection -> (structure)
                                          The criteria  for  inspecting  login
                                          requests, used by the ATP rule group
                                          to validate credentials usage.

                                          PayloadType -> (string)
                                             The payload type for  your  login
                                             endpoint, either JSON or form en-

                                             username field.

                                             How  you  specify this depends on
                                             the payload type.

                                             o For JSON payloads, specify  the
                                               field name in JSON pointer syn-

                                               username field specification is
                                               /login/username and  the  pass-
                                               word   field  specification  is
                                               /login/password .

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use  the  HTML  form names. For
                                               example, for an HTML form  with
                                               input  elements named username1
                                               and password1  ,  the  username

                                               specification is password1 .

                                             Identifier -> (string)
                                                 The   name  of  the  username
                                                 field.      For       example
                                                 /form/username .

                                          PasswordField -> (structure)
                                             Details  about  your  login  page
                                             password field.

                                             How you specify this  depends  on
                                             the payload type.

                                             o For  JSON payloads, specify the

                                               word": "THE_PASSWORD" } } , the
                                               username field specification is
                                               /login/username  and  the pass-

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use the HTML  form  names.  For
                                               example,  for an HTML form with

                        LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement to match against labels that have
                            been added to the web request by rules  that  have
                            already run in the web ACL.

                            The  label  match  statement provides the label or
                            namespace string to search for. The  label  string
                            can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully  qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                            namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added the label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                            qualified  name  in  your  label match string, WAF
                            performs the search for labels that were added  in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-
                               bel name or just the namespace.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The string to match against.  The  setting  you
                               provide  for  this  depends on the match state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If the Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,  then  this
                                 specification  must  include the name and can
                                 include any  number  of  preceding  namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then  this
                                 specification  can include any number of con-
                                 tiguous namespace strings,  and  can  include
                                 the  entire  label  namespace prefix from the
                                 rule group or web ACL where the label  origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels  are  case sensitive and components of a
                               label must be separated by colon,  for  example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in

                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-

                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes

                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-

                 ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule  statement used to run the rules that are defined
                     in a managed rule group. To use this, provide the  vendor
                     name  and  the  name of the rule group in this statement.
                     You can retrieve the  required  names  by  calling   Lis-
                     tAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                     You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for example
                     for use inside a NotStatement or  OrStatement  .  It  can
                     only  be  referenced  as  a  top-level statement within a
                     rule.

                     NOTE:
                        You are charged additional fees when you use  the  WAF

                     VendorName -> (string)
                        The name of the managed rule  group  vendor.  You  use
                        this,  along with the rule group name, to identify the
                        rule group.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the managed  rule  group.  You  use  this,
                        along  with  the  vendor  name,  to  identify the rule
                        group.

                     Version -> (string)
                        The version of the managed rule group to use.  If  you
                        specify  this,  the version setting is fixed until you
                        change it. If you don't specify  this,  WAF  uses  the
                        vendor's  default  version, and then keeps the version
                        at the vendor's default when the  vendor  updates  the
                        managed rule group settings.

                     ExcludedRules -> (list)
                        Rules  in  the referenced rule group whose actions are
                        set to Count .

                        NOTE:
                            Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides  .
                            It  accepts  any  valid  action setting, including
                            Count .

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose  ac-
                            tion you want to override to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               . It accepts any valid action setting,  includ-
                               ing Count .

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of the rule whose action you want to

                        An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of
                        the  web  requests  that  are evaluated by the managed
                        rule group. Requests are only evaluated  by  the  rule
                        group  if they match the scope-down statement. You can
                        use any nestable  Statement in the  scope-down  state-
                        ment,  and  you  can nest statements at any level, the
                        same as you can for a rule statement.

                        ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string  match
                            search  for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte
                            match statement provides the bytes to search  for,
                            the  location  in  requests  that  you want WAF to
                            search, and other settings. The  bytes  to  search
                            for  are  typically a string that corresponds with
                            ASCII characters. In the WAF console and  the  de-
                            veloper  guide,  this  is  called  a  string match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF  searches  only in the part of web requests
                               that you designate for  inspection  in   Field-
                               ToMatch  .  The  maximum length of the value is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid values depend on the component  that  you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath  :  The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               If  SearchString includes alphabetic characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value.
                               The maximum length  of  the  value  before  you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For  example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you  want  to  search the User-Agent header for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing  MIME  base64-encoding  and include the re-
                               sulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value  of
                               SearchString .
                                   If  you're using the CLI or one of the Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The value that you want WAF to search for.  The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": {"KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented  in hexadecimal format, (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The  area within the portion of the web request
                               that you want WAF to search for SearchString  .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString ,  and  Search-
                               String  must  contain only alphanumeric charac-
                               ters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,  or  _).  In
                               addition,  SearchString  must  be a word, which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified  part of the web request or is preceded
                                 by a character  other  than  an  alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString is at the end of  the  specified
                                 part  of  the web request or is followed by a
                                 character other than an alphanumeric  charac-
                                 ter  or  underscore (_), for example, BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The value of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest  must  exactly match the value of Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               beginning  of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that inspects for malicious SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request  bodies,  see  the  JsonBody object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders":  {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the headers nor-
                                        mally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-

                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies

                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify one or more transformations in  a  rule
                               statement,  WAF performs all transformations on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority setting, before  inspecting  the  content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations  that  are de-
                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-
                                      cesses  all transformations, from lowest
                                      priority to highest,  before  inspecting
                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE - Command-line  transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness of attackers  who  in-
                                          ject   an   operating   system  com-
                                          mand-line command  and  use  unusual
                                          formatting  to  disguise some or all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace the following characters  with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented in hexadecimal format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple
                                          slashes, directory  self-references,
                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate more  false  positives,  especially  if
                                   your  web  requests  frequently contain un-
                                   usual strings. For information about  iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see

                                   LOW  is  generally  a better choice for re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against  SQL injection attacks or that have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  inspects  for  cross-site
                            scripting  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a  vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For
                                   information about how to  handle  oversized
                                   request  bodies,  see  the  JsonBody object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      All , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-

                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF  does not support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of  request  headers  when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the headers nor-

                                      fined for a  rule  statement.  WAF  pro-
                                      cesses  all transformations, from lowest
                                      priority to highest,  before  inspecting
                                      the  transformed content. The priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You  can specify the following transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation  that ignores charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE - Command-line  transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness of attackers  who  in-
                                          ject   an   operating   system  com-
                                          mand-line command  and  use  unusual
                                          formatting  to  disguise some or all
                                          of the command.

                                      o Delete the following characters: \ " '
                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace the following characters  with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters  with  a  space character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                      o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                      o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                      o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE  - Decode characters that
                                          were encoded using  CSS  2.x  escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding  process, so it can help to
                                          uncover ASCII characters  that  were
                                          encoded   using  CSS  encoding  that
                                          wouldnt typically be  encoded.  It's
                                          also  useful  in countering evasion,
                                          which is a combination  of  a  back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters. For example,  ja\vascript  for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  - Decode the fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b  ,  \f , \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ ,
                                          \? , \' , \" ,  \xHH  (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal  characters  into  a bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded  characters  with unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with  a  "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented in hexadecimal format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#xhhhh;  , with the corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces characters  that  are  repre-
                                        sented   in  decimal  format,  (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn; , with  the  corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences. If a \  u  HHHH  code  is
                                          in  the  full-width ASCII code range
                                          of FF01-FF5E , then the higher  byte
                                          is  used  to  detect  and adjust the
                                          lower byte. If not, only  the  lower
                                          byte  is used and the higher byte is
                                          zeroed, causing a possible  loss  of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE  -  Convert uppercase let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE - Specify  NONE  if  you  don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH   -  Remove  multiple
                                          slashes, directory  self-references,
                                          and  directory  back-references that
                                          are not at the beginning of the  in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same as NORMALIZE_PATH ,  but  first
                                          converts   backslash  characters  to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS  - Replace each oc-
                                          currence of a  C-style  comment  (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple consecutive occurrences are  not
                                          compressed.   Unterminated  comments
                                          are  also  replaced  with  a   space
                                          (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone
                                          termination of a comment  (*/  )  is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes
                                          in the input with  space  characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE   -  Decode  SQL  hex
                                          data. Example (0x414243  )  will  be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE  -  Decode  a URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE  ,
                                          but  with support for Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the  full-width  ASCII code range of
                                          FF01-FF5E , the higher byte is  used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise, only the  lower  byte  is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE  - Convert all UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and
                                          false-negatives for non-English lan-
                                          guages.

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that compares a number  of  bytes
                            against  the  size of a request component, using a
                            comparison operator, such as greater than  (>)  or
                            less  than  (<).  For  example, you can use a size
                            constraint statement to  look  for  query  strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If  you configure WAF to inspect the request body,
                            WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB).  If
                            the  request  body for your web requests never ex-
                            ceeds 8192 bytes, you could use a size  constraint
                            statement  to  block  requests that have a request
                            body greater than 8192 bytes.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest  to  filter  on,  the  slash  (/) in the URI
                            counts as one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,

                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                        tion criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-

                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace
                                          HTML-encoded characters  with  unen-
                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a

                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the
                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try and region and that matches  against  web  re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels every request that it inspects regardless  of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To  manage requests only by country, you can use
                              this statement by itself and specify  the  coun-
                              tries  that  you  want  to  match against in the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise, configure your geo  match  rule  with
                              Count  action  so  that it only labels requests.
                              Then, add one or more label match rules  to  run
                              after  the  geo match rule and configure them to
                              match against the geographic labels  and  handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and
                            region codes from the  International  Organization
                            for  Standardization  (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF de-
                            termines the codes using either the IP address  in
                            the  web request origin or, if you specify it, the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If you use the web request origin, the label  for-
                            mats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country
                            code>-<ISO   region   code>   and    awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label for-
                            mats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO  coun-
                            try   code>-<ISO   region  code>  and  awswaf:for-
                            wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            For additional details, see Geographic match  rule
                            statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An  array  of  two-character country codes that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN"  ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region  and  country labels that it adds to re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for  the  rule  to  evaluate. In this case, you
                               configure the rule to only count  matching  re-
                               quests,  but it will still generate logging and
                               count metrics for any matches. You  can  reduce
                               the  logging and metrics that the rule produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a
                            rule  group  with your rules, then provide the ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,
                            for  example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement or
                            OrStatement . You can only use a rule group refer-
                            ence statement at the top level inside a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions that are  configured  inside  the  rule
                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                               (structure)
                                   Action setting to use in  the  place  of  a
                                   rule  action  that is configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule to override.

                                      rule group.

                                      Block -> (structure)

                                                 to the  web  request  client.
                                                 You  can  define a custom re-

                                                 you first define the response
                                                 body key  and  value  in  the

                                                        x-amzn-waf- , to avoid

                                                    Value -> (string)

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to detect web requests  com-
                            ing   from  particular  IP  addresses  or  address
                            ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that  speci-
                            fies  the  addresses  you want to detect, then use
                            the ARN of that set in this statement.  To  create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set.
                            You create and maintain  the  set  independent  of
                            your  rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the  referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the   IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The  position  in  the header to search for
                                   the IP address. The header can  contain  IP
                                   addresses  of  the original client and also
                                   of proxies. For example, the  header  value
                                   could  be  10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10
                                   where the first IP address  identifies  the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The options for this setting are  the  fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in
                                     the list of IP addresses in  the  header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY - Inspect all  IP  addresses  in  the
                                     header  for  a  match. If the header con-
                                     tains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF  in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions that you want to detect, then use  the
                            ARN  of  that set in this statement. A web request
                            matches the pattern set rule statement if the  re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set. To create a  regex  pattern  set,  see   Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent  of your rules. This allows you to use
                            the single set in multiple rules. When you  update
                            the  referenced set, WAF automatically updates all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-

                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-
                                        mally,  according  to the rule inspec-

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection. If you
                               specify  one  or more transformations in a rule
                               statement, WAF performs all transformations  on
                               the content of the request component identified
                               by FieldToMatch , starting from the lowest pri-
                               ority  setting,  before  inspecting the content
                               for a match.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations  that  are  de-
                                      fined  for  a  rule  statement. WAF pro-
                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-

                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces
                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          HTML_ENTITY_DECODE     -     Replace

                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a

                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-

                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes
                                          from the input.

                                          REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  oc-
                                          currence  of  a  C-style comment (/*
                                          ... */ ) with a single space. Multi-
                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes
                                          in  the  input with space characters
                                          (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                          SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL   hex
                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for
                            each originating IP address, and triggers the rule
                            action  when  the  rate  exceeds  a limit that you
                            specify on the number of requests in any  5-minute
                            time  span.  You  can  use this to put a temporary
                            block on requests from an IP address that is send-
                            ing excessive requests.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each instance of a rate-based rule that  you  use.
                            For  example,  if  you provide the same rate-based
                            rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of  the  two
                            rule  statements represents a separate instance of
                            the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking  and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside a rule group, and then use that rule  group
                            in  multiple  places,  each use creates a separate
                            instance of the rate-based rule that gets its  own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            When  the  rule  action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                            tional requests from the IP address until the  re-
                            quest rate falls below the limit.

                            You  can  optionally nest another statement inside
                            the rate-based statement, to narrow the  scope  of
                            the  rule  so  that  it  only counts requests that
                            match the nested statement. For example, based  on
                            recent  requests  that  you  have seen from an at-
                            tacker, you might create a rate-based rule with  a
                            nested  AND  rule statement that contains the fol-
                            lowing nested statements:

                            o An IP match statement with an IP set that speci-
                              fies the address 192.0.2.44.

                            o A  string  match  statement that searches in the
                              User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                            In this rate-based rule, you also  define  a  rate
                            limit.  For this example, the rate limit is 1,000.
                            Requests that meet the criteria  of  both  of  the
                            nested  statements  are  counted. If the count ex-
                            ceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,  the  rule
                            action  triggers.  Requests  that  do not meet the
                            criteria of both of the nested statements are  not
                            counted  towards  the  rate  limit and are not af-
                            fected by this rule.

                            You cannot nest a  RateBasedStatement  inside  an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or OrStatement . You can define a  RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single originating IP address. If the statement
                               includes  a  ScopeDownStatement , this limit is
                               applied only to the  requests  that  match  the
                               statement.

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts. The options are the following:

                               o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the  IP
                                 address from the web request origin.

                               o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts
                                 on the first IP address in an HTTP header. If
                                 you use this, configure the ForwardedIPConfig
                                 , to specify the header to use.

                            ( ... recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig ->  (struc-
                            ture)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This is required if AggregateKeyType is set  to
                               FORWARDED_IP .

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the request doesn't have a valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        AndStatement -> (structure)
                            A logical rule statement  used  to  combine  other
                            rule  statements  with AND logic. You provide more
                            than one  Statement within the AndStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The statements to combine with AND  logic.  You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                        OrStatement -> (structure)
                            A  logical  rule  statement  used to combine other
                            rule statements with OR logic.  You  provide  more
                            than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The  statements  to  combine with OR logic. You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                        NotStatement -> (structure)
                            A logical rule statement used to  negate  the  re-
                            sults  of  another rule statement. You provide one
                            Statement within the NotStatement .

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to run the  rules  that  are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the  rule
                            group  in this statement. You can retrieve the re-
                            quired names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRule-
                            Groups .

                            You  cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for
                            example for use inside a NotStatement or  OrState-
                            ment  .  It  can only be referenced as a top-level
                            statement within a rule.

                            NOTE:
                               You are charged additional fees  when  you  use
                               the  WAF Bot Control managed rule group AWSMan-
                               agedRulesBotControlRuleSet  or  the  WAF  Fraud
                               Control  account takeover prevention (ATP) man-

                               more information, see WAF Pricing .

                            VendorName -> (string)
                               The  name of the managed rule group vendor. You
                               use this, along with the rule  group  name,  to
                               identify the rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use
                               this, along with the vendor name,  to  identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version  of the managed rule group to use.
                               If you specify this,  the  version  setting  is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this, WAF uses the  vendor's  default  version,
                               and  then keeps the version at the vendor's de-
                               fault when the vendor updates the managed  rule
                               group settings.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            (list)
                               Additional information that's used by a managed
                               rule  group. Many managed rule groups don't re-
                               quire this.

                               Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet configuration
                               object for the account takeover prevention man-
                               aged rule group, to provide information such as
                               the  sign-in  page  of your application and the
                               type of content to accept or  reject  from  the
                               client.

                               Use  the  AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet con-
                               figuration object to configure  the  protection
                               level  that you want the Bot Control rule group
                               to use.

                                   Additional information  that's  used  by  a
                                   managed   rule  group.  Many  managed  rule
                                   groups don't require this.

                                   Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet  configu-
                                   ration object for the account takeover pre-
                                   vention managed rule group, to provide  in-
                                   formation  such as the sign-in page of your
                                   application and the type of content to  ac-
                                   cept or reject from the client.

                                   Use   the  AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet
                                   configuration object to configure the  pro-
                                   tection level that you want the Bot Control

                                      LoginPath -> (string)
                                          The path of the login  endpoint  for
                                          your  application.  For example, for

                                             username field.

                                             How  you  specify this depends on
                                             the payload type.

                                             o For JSON payloads, specify  the
                                               field name in JSON pointer syn-

                                               /login/username and  the  pass-
                                               word   field  specification  is
                                               /login/password .

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use  the  HTML  form names. For
                                               example, for an HTML form  with
                                               input  elements named username1
                                               and password1  ,  the  username
                                               field  specification  is  user-
                                               name1 and  the  password  field
                                               specification is password1 .

                                             Identifier -> (string)
                                                 The   name  of  the  username
                                                 field.      For       example
                                                 /form/username .

                                          PasswordField -> (structure)
                                             Details  about  your  login  page
                                             password field.

                                             How you specify this  depends  on
                                             the payload type.

                                             o For  JSON payloads, specify the
                                               field name in JSON pointer syn-

                                               word": "THE_PASSWORD" } } , the
                                               username field specification is
                                               /login/username  and  the pass-

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use the HTML  form  names.  For
                                               example,  for an HTML form with
                                               input elements named  username1
                                               and  password1  ,  the username
                                               field  specification  is  user-
                                               name1  and  the  password field
                                               specification is password1 .

                                             Identifier -> (string)
                                                 The  name  of  the   password
                                                 field.       For      example

                        LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement to match against labels that have
                            been added to the web request by rules  that  have
                            already run in the web ACL.

                            The  label  match  statement provides the label or
                            namespace string to search for. The  label  string
                            can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully  qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                            namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added the label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                            qualified  name  in  your  label match string, WAF
                            performs the search for labels that were added  in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-

                            Key -> (string)

                               provide  for  this  depends on the match state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If the Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,  then  this
                                 specification  must  include the name and can
                                 include any  number  of  preceding  namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then  this
                                 specification  can include any number of con-
                                 tiguous namespace strings,  and  can  include
                                 the  entire  label  namespace prefix from the
                                 rule group or web ACL where the label  origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels  are  case sensitive and components of a
                               label must be separated by colon,  for  example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                        RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion  by  the  underlying host service. For

                                   request bodies, see the Body object config-
                                   uration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the  body of a web request when the body
                                      exceeds 8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only  the
                                      first  8 KB of the request body are for-
                                      warded to WAF  by  the  underlying  host
                                      service.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the body  normally,
                                        according  to the rule inspection cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the re-
                                   quest body are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                   tion by the underlying  host  service.  For
                                   information  about  how to handle oversized
                                   request bodies,  see  the  JsonBody  object
                                   configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      All  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the body of a web request when the  body
                                      exceeds  8  KB  (8192  bytes).  Only the
                                      first 8 KB of the request body are  for-
                                      warded  to  WAF  by  the underlying host
                                      service.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the body normally,
                                        according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                        teria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over 8 KB.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-

                                      clude2"} }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify All , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are larger than WAF can inspect.
                                      WAF does not support inspecting the  en-
                                      tire  contents  of  request headers when
                                      they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 to-
                                      tal headers. The underlying host service
                                      forwards a maximum of 200 headers and at
                                      most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  headers  nor-

                                      cesses all transformations, from  lowest
                                      priority  to  highest, before inspecting
                                      the transformed content. The  priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      You can specify the following  transfor-
                                      mation types:
                                          BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                          coded string.

                                          BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a  Base64
                                          -encoded string, but use a forgiving
                                          implementation that ignores  charac-
                                          ters that aren't valid.

                                          CMD_LINE  - Command-line transforma-
                                          tions. These are helpful in reducing
                                          effectiveness  of  attackers who in-
                                          ject  an   operating   system   com-
                                          mand-line  command  and  use unusual
                                          formatting to disguise some  or  all
                                          of the command.

                                        ^

                                      o Delete  spaces  before  the  following
                                        characters: / (

                                      o Replace  the following characters with
                                        a space: , ;

                                      o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                      o Convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                                        lowercase (a-z)
                                          COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these
                                          characters with  a  space  character
                                          (decimal 32):

                                      o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                      o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                      o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                          multiple spaces with one space.

                                          CSS_DECODE - Decode characters  that
                                          were  encoded  using  CSS 2.x escape
                                          rules syndata.html#characters . This
                                          function uses up to two bytes in the
                                          decoding process, so it can help  to
                                          uncover  ASCII  characters that were
                                          encoded  using  CSS  encoding   that
                                          wouldnt  typically  be encoded. It's
                                          also useful in  countering  evasion,
                                          which  is  a  combination of a back-
                                          slash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                          ters.  For  example, ja\vascript for
                                          javascript.

                                          ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the  fol-
                                          lowing ANSI C escape sequences: \a ,
                                          \b , \f , \n , \r , \t , \v ,  \\  ,
                                          \?  ,  \' , \" , \xHH (hexadecimal),
                                          \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't
                                          valid remain in the output.

                                          HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  a  string  of
                                          hexadecimal characters  into  a  bi-
                                          nary.

                                          coded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE
                                          performs these operations:

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                      o Replaces   (ampersand)nbsp;   with   a
                                        non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                      o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with a "less
                                        than" symbol

                                      o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                        sand)#xhhhh; , with the  corresponding
                                        characters

                                      o Replaces  characters  that  are repre-
                                        sented  in  decimal  format,   (amper-
                                        sand)#nnnn;  ,  with the corresponding
                                        characters
                                          JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape
                                          sequences.  If  a \  u  HHHH code is
                                          in the full-width ASCII  code  range
                                          of  FF01-FF5E , then the higher byte
                                          is used to  detect  and  adjust  the
                                          lower  byte.  If not, only the lower
                                          byte is used and the higher byte  is
                                          zeroed,  causing  a possible loss of
                                          information.

                                          LOWERCASE - Convert  uppercase  let-
                                          ters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                          data in the input. The computed hash
                                          is in a raw binary form.

                                          NONE  -  Specify  NONE  if you don't
                                          want any text transformations.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH  -  Remove   multiple
                                          slashes,  directory self-references,
                                          and directory  back-references  that
                                          are  not at the beginning of the in-
                                          put from an input string.

                                          NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is  the
                                          same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH , but first
                                          converts  backslash  characters   to
                                          forward slashes.

                                          ple  consecutive occurrences are not
                                          compressed.  Unterminated   comments
                                          are   also  replaced  with  a  space
                                          (ASCII 0x20). However, a  standalone
                                          termination  of  a  comment (*/ ) is
                                          not acted upon.

                                          data.  Example  (0x414243  ) will be
                                          decoded to (ABC ).

                                          URL_DECODE -  Decode  a  URL-encoded
                                          value.

                                          URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE ,
                                          but with support for  Microsoft-spe-
                                          cific %u encoding. If the code is in
                                          the full-width ASCII code  range  of
                                          FF01-FF5E  , the higher byte is used
                                          to detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                          Otherwise,  only  the  lower byte is
                                          used and the higher byte is zeroed.

                                          UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all  UTF-8
                                          character sequences to Unicode. This
                                          helps input normalization, and mini-
                                          mizing      false-positives      and

                                   plication.   For   example,   for  the  URL
                                   https://example.com/web/login ,  you  would
                                   provide the path /web/login .

                                   The  rule group inspects only HTTP POST re-

                                   The  criteria  for  inspecting responses to
                                   login requests, used by the ATP rule  group
                                   to track login failure rates.

                                   The  ATP rule group evaluates the responses
                                   that your protected resources send back  to
                                   client  login  attempts,  keeping  count of
                                   successful and failed attempts from each IP
                                   address  and client session. Using this in-

                                   attempts in a short amount of time.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Response inspection is available only in

                                      will  not  be  enabled. You can only use
                                      the response inspection capabilities  of
                                      the  ATP  managed rule group in web ACLs

                                      SuccessCodes -> (list)
                                          Status  codes  in  the response that
                                          indicate a successful login attempt.
                                          To be counted as a successful login,
                                          the response status code must  match
                                          one  of  these.  Each  code  must be
                                          unique among the success and failure
                                          status codes.

                                          (structure)
                                             A custom header  for  custom  re-
                                             quest and response handling. This
                                             is used  in   CustomResponse  and
                                             CustomRequestHandling .

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The   name   of   the  custom
                                                 header.

                                                 For custom request header in-
                                                 sertion, when WAF inserts the
                                                 header into the  request,  it
                                                 prefixes       this      name
                                                 x-amzn-waf- , to avoid confu-
                                                 sion  with  the  headers that
                                                 are already in  the  request.
                                                 For  example,  for the header
                                                 name sample , WAF inserts the
                                                 header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                             Value -> (string)
                                                 The   value   of  the  custom
                                                 header.

                 LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement to match against labels that  have  been
                     added  to  the web request by rules that have already run
                     in the web ACL.

                     The label match statement provides the label or namespace
                     string  to  search  for. The label string can represent a
                     part or all of the fully qualified label  name  that  had
                     been  added  to  the  web request. Fully qualified labels
                     have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                     prefix  identifies  the  rule group or web ACL context of
                     the rule that added the label. If you do not provide  the
                     fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF per-
                     forms the search for labels that were added in  the  same
                     context as the label match statement.

                     Scope -> (string)
                        Specify whether you want to match using the label name
                        or just the namespace.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The string to match against. The setting  you  provide
                        for  this  depends on the match statement's Scope set-
                        ting:

                        o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then this  specifica-
                          tion  must include the name and can include any num-
                          ber of preceding namespace specifications and prefix
                          up to providing the fully qualified label name.

                        o If  the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then this speci-
                          fication can include any number of contiguous  name-
                          space  strings,  and  can  include  the entire label
                          namespace prefix from the  rule  group  or  web  ACL
                          where the label originates.

                        Labels  are  case  sensitive and components of a label
                        must be separated by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                 RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to search  web  request  components
                     for a match against a single regular expression.

                     RegexString -> (string)
                        The string representing the regular expression.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle  oversized request bodies, see the Body
                            object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates  the
                            type  of  operation that the request is asking the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately  follows  the request headers. This is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data  that  you want to send to your web server as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  the  request
                            body  are  forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the
                            underlying host service. For information about how
                            to  handle oversized request bodies, see the Json-
                            Body object configuration.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  All  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if it fails to completely
                               parse the JSON body. The options are  the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain text. WAF applies the text  transforma-
                                 tions  and  inspection  criteria that you de-
                                 fined for the JSON  inspection  to  the  body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If you don't provide this setting,  WAF  parses
                               and  evaluates the content only up to the first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF does its best  to  parse  the  entire  JSON
                               body,  but  might be forced to stop for reasons
                               such as  invalid  characters,  duplicate  keys,
                               truncation,  and  any  content  whose root node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF parses the JSON in the  following  examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the body  of  a  web
                               request  when  the  body  exceeds  8  KB  (8192
                               bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the request body
                               are  forwarded  to  WAF  by the underlying host
                               service.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the body normally, accord-
                                 ing to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over 8 KB.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify All , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the headers  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does
                               not support inspecting the entire  contents  of
                               request  headers  when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192
                               bytes) or 200  total  headers.  The  underlying
                               host  service forwards a maximum of 200 headers
                               and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  - Inspect the headers normally, ac-
                                 cording to the rule inspection criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must configure
                            scope and pattern matching filters in the  Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes)  of  a  request's
                            cookies  and  only  the first 200 cookies are for-
                            warded to WAF for  inspection  by  the  underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies  the pattern matching filters to the cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The  filter  to  use  to identify the subset of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You must specify exactly  one  setting:  either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "IncludedCook-

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify All ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the cookies  of  the  re-
                               quest are larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text  transformations  eliminate  some  of the unusual
                        formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in  an
                        effort to bypass detection. If you specify one or more
                        transformations in a rule statement, WAF performs  all
                        transformations  on  the content of the request compo-
                        nent identified by FieldToMatch ,  starting  from  the
                        lowest priority setting, before inspecting the content
                        for a match.

                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations  that  are  defined  for a rule
                               statement. WAF processes  all  transformations,
                               from  lowest  priority  to  highest, before in-
                               specting the transformed content.  The  priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               You can specify  the  following  transformation
                               types:
                                   BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode  a Base64 -encoded
                                   string.

                                   BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode  a  Base64  -en-
                                   coded string, but use a forgiving implemen-
                                   tation that ignores characters that  aren't
                                   valid.

                                   CMD_LINE  -  Command-line  transformations.
                                   These are helpful in reducing effectiveness
                                   of attackers who inject an operating system
                                   command-line command and use  unusual  for-
                                   matting to disguise some or all of the com-
                                   mand.

                               o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                               o Delete spaces before  the  following  charac-
                                 ters: / (

                               o Replace   the  following  characters  with  a
                                 space: , ;

                               o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                               o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to  lowercase
                                 (a-z)
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  - Replace these char-
                                   acters with a space character (decimal 32):

                               o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                               o \t , tab, decimal 9

                               o \n , newline, decimal 10

                               o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                               o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                               o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                   COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple
                                   spaces with one space.

                                   CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters that were
                                   encoded using CSS  2.x  escape  rules  syn-
                                   data.html#characters  .  This function uses
                                   up to two bytes in the decoding process, so
                                   it  can  help  to  uncover ASCII characters

                                   wouldnt  typically  be  encoded.  It's also
                                   useful in countering evasion,  which  is  a
                                   combination of a backslash and non-hexadec-
                                   imal characters. For  example,  ja\vascript
                                   for javascript.

                                   that aren't valid remain in the output.

                                   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal
                                   characters into a binary.

                                   then the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                   adjust  the  lower  byte.  If not, only the
                                   lower byte is used and the higher  byte  is
                                   zeroed, causing a possible loss of informa-
                                   tion.

                                   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z)
                                   to lowercase (a-z).

                                   MD5  -  Calculate an MD5 hash from the data
                                   in the input. The computed hash is in a raw
                                   binary form.

                                   NONE  -  Specify NONE if you don't want any
                                   text transformations.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple  slashes,
                                   directory  self-references,  and  directory
                                   back-references that are not at the  begin-
                                   ning of the input from an input string.

                                   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  -  This  is the same as
                                   NORMALIZE_PATH , but first  converts  back-
                                   slash characters to forward slashes.

                                   REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove all NULL bytes from
                                   the input.

                                   REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each  occurrence
                                   of  a  C-style  comment (/* ... */ ) with a
                                   single space. Multiple  consecutive  occur-
                                   rences  are  not  compressed.  Unterminated
                                   comments are also  replaced  with  a  space
                                   (ASCII  0x20). However, a standalone termi-
                                   nation of a comment  (*/  )  is  not  acted
                                   upon.

                                   REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace NULL bytes in the
                                   input with space characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                   ple (0x414243 ) will be decoded to (ABC ).

                                   URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE , but with
                                   support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding.
                                   If the code is in the full-width ASCII code
                                   range of FF01-FF5E ,  the  higher  byte  is
                                   used  to  detect and adjust the lower byte.
                                   Otherwise, only the lower byte is used  and
                                   the higher byte is zeroed.

                                   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 charac-
                                   ter sequences to Unicode. This helps  input
                                   normalization,  and  minimizing false-posi-
                                   tives and false-negatives  for  non-English

              Action -> (structure)
                 The  action  that  WAF  should  take on a web request when it
                 matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level can
                 override the rule action setting.

                 This is used only for rules whose statements do not reference
                 a rule group. Rule statements that reference a rule group in-
                 clude  RuleGroupReferenceStatement and ManagedRuleGroupState-
                 ment .

                 You must specify either this Action setting or the rule Over-
                 rideAction setting, but not both:

                 o If  the rule statement does not reference a rule group, use
                   this rule action setting and not the rule  override  action
                   setting.

                 o If  the  rule  statement  references  a rule group, use the
                   override action setting and not this action setting.

                 Block -> (structure)
                     Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                     CustomResponse -> (structure)
                        Defines a custom response for the web request.

                            The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                            For a list of status codes that  you  can  use  in
                            your  custom responses, see Supported status codes
                            for custom response in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                            References the response body that you want WAF  to
                            return to the web request client. You can define a
                            custom response for a rule action or a default web
                            ACL  action  that is set to block. To do this, you
                            first define the response body key  and  value  in
                            the  CustomResponseBodies  setting for the  WebACL
                            or  RuleGroup where you want to use it.  Then,  in
                            the rule action or web ACL default action BlockAc-
                            tion setting, you reference the response body  us-
                            ing this key.

                        ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                            The HTTP headers to use in the response. Duplicate

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the   header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                            (structure)
                               A custom header for custom request and response
                               handling.  This  is used in  CustomResponse and
                               CustomRequestHandling .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the custom header.

                 Challenge -> (structure)
                     Instructs WAF to run a Challenge check  against  the  web
                     request.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the custom header.

              OverrideAction -> (structure)
                 The action to use in the place of  the  action  that  results
                 from  the  rule  group evaluation. Set the override action to
                 none to leave the result of the rule group alone. Set  it  to
                 count to override the result to count only.

                 You  can  only  use this for rule statements that reference a
                 rule group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement and ManagedRule-
                 GroupStatement .

                 NOTE:
                     This  option  is  usually set to none. It does not affect
                     how the rules in the rule group  are  evaluated.  If  you
                     want  the  rules in the rule group to only count matches,
                     do not use this and instead use the rule action  override
                     option,  with  Count action, in your rule group reference
                     statement settings.

                 Count -> (structure)
                     Override the rule group evaluation result to count only.

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how  the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If you
                        want the  rules  in  the  rule  group  to  only  count
                        matches,  do not use this and instead use the rule ac-
                        tion override option, with Count action, in your  rule
                        group reference statement settings.

                            (structure)
                               A custom header for custom request and response
                               handling.  This  is used in  CustomResponse and

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the custom header.

                 None -> (structure)
                     Don't override the rule group evaluation result. This  is
                     the most common setting.

              RuleLabels -> (list)
                 Labels  to  apply  to  web requests that match the rule match
                 statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching web
                 requests.  A  fully qualified label is the concatenation of a
                 label namespace and a rule label. The rule's  rule  group  or
                 web ACL defines the label namespace.

                 Rules  that  run  after  this  rule  in the web ACL can match
                 against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement .

                 For each label, provide a  case-sensitive  string  containing
                 optional  namespaces  and a label name, according to the fol-
                 lowing guidelines:

                 o Separate each component of the label with a colon.

                 o Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

                 o You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.

                 o Don't use the following reserved words in your label speci-
                   fication: aws , waf , managed , rulegroup , webacl , regex-
                   patternset , or ipset .

                 For example, myLabelName or nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLabelName
                 .

                 (structure)
                     A single label container. This is used as an element of a
                     label array in multiple contexts, for example, in RuleLa-
                     bels  inside  a   Rule  and  in Labels inside a  Sampled-
                     HTTPRequest .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The label string.

              VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
                 Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request
                 sample collection.

                 SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                     A  boolean indicating whether WAF should store a sampling
                     of the web requests that match the rules.  You  can  view
                     the sampled requests through the WAF console.

                 CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                     A  boolean  indicating  whether  the  associated resource
                     sends metrics to  Amazon  CloudWatch.  For  the  list  of
                     available metrics, see WAF Metrics .

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     A  name  of  the  Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The
                     name can contain only the characters: A-Z,  a-z,  0-9,  -
                     (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to
                     128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or  met-
                     ric  names that are reserved for WAF, for example All and
                     Default_Action .

              CaptchaConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations.  If  you
                 don't specify this, WAF uses the CAPTCHA configuration that's
                 defined for the web ACL.

                 ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                     Determines how long a CAPTCHA timestamp in the token  re-
                     mains  valid  after  the  client  successfully  solves  a
                     CAPTCHA puzzle.

                     ImmunityTime -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  a  CAPTCHA  or
                        challenge  timestamp  is  considered valid by WAF. The
                        default setting is 300.

                        For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

              ChallengeConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies how WAF should handle Challenge evaluations. If you
                 don't  specify  this,  WAF  uses  the challenge configuration
                 that's defined for the web ACL.

                 ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                     Determines how long a challenge timestamp  in  the  token
                     remains valid after the client successfully responds to a
                     challenge.

                     ImmunityTime -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  a  CAPTCHA  or
                        challenge  timestamp  is  considered valid by WAF. The
                        default setting is 300.

                        For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

       --visibility-config (structure)
          Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample
          collection.

          SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
              A  boolean indicating whether WAF should store a sampling of the
              web requests that match the rules. You can view the sampled  re-
              quests through the WAF console.

          CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              A  boolean indicating whether the associated resource sends met-
              rics to Amazon CloudWatch. For the list  of  available  metrics,
              see WAF Metrics .

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  name  of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The name can
              contain only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -  (hyphen),  and  _
              (underscore).  The  name can be from one to 128 characters long.
              It can't contain whitespace or metric names  that  are  reserved
              for WAF, for example All and Default_Action .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SampledRequestsEnabled=boolean,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=boolean,MetricName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SampledRequestsEnabled": true|false,
            "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true|false,
            "MetricName": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A  tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags are
              key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and  manage  your
              resources,  for purposes like billing or other management. Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and  the tag value represents a specific value within that cate-
              gory, such as "test," "development,"  or  "production".  Or  you
              might  set  the  tag key to "customer" and the value to the cus-
              tomer name or ID. You can specify one or more  tags  to  add  to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You  can  tag  the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
              through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and  regex  pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --custom-response-bodies (map)
          A map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you create  a
          rule  with a block action, you can send a custom response to the web
          request. You define these for the web ACL, and then use them in  the
          rules and default actions that you define in the web ACL.

          For  information  about  customizing web requests and responses, see
          Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the  WAF  Developer
          Guide .

          For  information  about  the limits on count and size for custom re-
          quest and response settings, see WAF quotas  in  the  WAF  Developer
          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The  response body to use in a custom response to a web request.
              This is referenced by key from  CustomResponse   CustomResponse-
              BodyKey .

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  type  of content in the payload that you are defining in
                 the Content string.

              Content -> (string)
                 The payload of the custom response.

                 You can use JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do  this,
                 you must specify JSON content in the ContentType setting.

                 For information about the limits on count and size for custom
                 request and response settings, see WAF quotas in the WAF  De-
                 veloper Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=ContentType=string,Content=string,KeyName2=ContentType=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "ContentType": "TEXT_PLAIN"|"TEXT_HTML"|"APPLICATION_JSON",
                "Content": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --captcha-config (structure)
          Specifies  how  WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations for rules that
          don't have their own CaptchaConfig settings. If  you  don't  specify
          this, WAF uses its default settings for CaptchaConfig .

          ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
              Determines  how  long  a  CAPTCHA timestamp in the token remains
              valid after the client successfully solves a CAPTCHA puzzle.

              ImmunityTime -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA  or  challenge
                 timestamp  is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is
                 300.

                 For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
              "ImmunityTime": long
            }
          }

       --challenge-config (structure)
          Specifies how WAF should handle challenge evaluations for rules that
          don't  have their own ChallengeConfig settings. If you don't specify
          this, WAF uses its default settings for ChallengeConfig .

          ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
              Determines how long a challenge timestamp in the  token  remains
              valid after the client successfully responds to a challenge.

              ImmunityTime -> (long)
                 The  amount  of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA or challenge
                 timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting  is
                 300.

                 For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
              "ImmunityTime": long
            }
          }

       --token-domains (list)
          Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token.
          This enables the use of tokens across multiple  protected  websites.
          When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't  specify
          a  list  of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of
          the protected resource. With a token domain list,  WAF  accepts  the
          resource's  host  domain  plus all domains in the token domain list,
          including their prefixed subdomains.

          Example  JSON:  "TokenDomains":  {   "mywebsite.com",   "myotherweb-
          site.com" }

          Public  suffixes  aren't allowed. For example, you can't use usa.gov
          or co.uk as token domains.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a web ACL

       The following create-web-acl command creates a  web  ACL  for  regional
       use. The rule statements for the web ACL are provided in a JSON-format-
       ted file.

          aws wafv2 create-web-acl \
              --name TestWebAcl \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --default-action Allow={} \
              --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=TestWebAclMetrics \
              --rules file://waf-rule.json \
              --region us-west-2

OUTPUT
       Summary -> (structure)
          High-level information about a  WebACL , returned by operations like
          create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
          use to retrieve and manage a WebACL , and the ARN, that you  provide
          to operations like  AssociateWebACL .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID  is  returned  in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

          LockToken -> (string)
              A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your
              get  and  list  requests, to mark the state of the entity at the
              time of the request. To make changes to  the  entity  associated
              with  the token, you provide the token to operations like update
              and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no  changes  have
              been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change
              has been made, the update fails with  a  WAFOptimisticLockExcep-
              tion  .  If  this happens, perform another get , and use the new
              token returned by that operation.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
