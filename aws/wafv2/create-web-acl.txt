CREATE-WEB-ACL()                                              CREATE-WEB-ACL()



NAME
       create-web-acl -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a  WebACL per the specifications provided.

       A  web  ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control
       web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines what to  look  for
       in  web  requests and an action that WAF applies to requests that match
       the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (al-
       low,  block)  for any request that does not match any of the rules. The
       rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types  Rule ,  RuleGroup
       ,  and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more
       Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an  Ama-
       zon  CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Appli-
       cation Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API, an  Amazon  Cognito  user
       pool,  an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access
       instance.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL af-
          ter you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an  App  Runner  ser-
          vice, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --default-action (structure)
          The  action  to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL
          match.

          Block -> (structure)
              Specifies that WAF should block requests by default.

              CustomResponse -> (structure)
                 Defines a custom response for the web request.

                 For information about customizing web requests and responses,
                 see  Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the WAF
                 Developer Guide .

                 ResponseCode -> (integer)
                     The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                     For a list of status codes that you can use in your  cus-
                     tom  responses, see Supported status codes for custom re-
                     sponse in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                     References the response body that you want WAF to  return
                     to  the  web  request client. You can define a custom re-
                     sponse for a rule action or a default web ACL action that
                     is  set  to  block.  To do this, you first define the re-
                     sponse body key and  value  in  the  CustomResponseBodies
                     setting  for  the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to
                     use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL  default  ac-
                     tion BlockAction setting, you reference the response body
                     using this key.

                 ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                     The HTTP headers to use in the response. You can  specify
                     any  header  name  except  for  content-type  . Duplicate
                     header names are not allowed.

                     For information about the limits on count  and  size  for
                     custom  request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A custom header for custom request and  response  han-
                        dling.  This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRe-
                        questHandling .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the custom header.

                            For custom request header insertion, when WAF  in-
                            serts  the  header  into  the request, it prefixes
                            this name x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                            the  headers  that are already in the request. For
                            example, for the header name sample , WAF  inserts
                            the header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the custom header.

          Allow -> (structure)
              Specifies that WAF should allow requests by default.

              CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                 Defines custom handling for the web request.

                 For information about customizing web requests and responses,
                 see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the  WAF
                 Developer Guide .

                 InsertHeaders -> (list)
                     The  HTTP  headers  to insert into the request. Duplicate
                     header names are not allowed.

                     For information about the limits on count  and  size  for
                     custom  request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A custom header for custom request and  response  han-
                        dling.  This is used in  CustomResponse and  CustomRe-
                        questHandling .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the custom header.

                            For custom request header insertion, when WAF  in-
                            serts  the  header  into  the request, it prefixes
                            this name x-amzn-waf- , to  avoid  confusion  with
                            the  headers  that are already in the request. For
                            example, for the header name sample , WAF  inserts
                            the header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the custom header.

       JSON Syntax:

              "CustomResponse": {
                "ResponseCode": integer,
                "CustomResponseBodyKey": "string",

              }
            }
          }

       --description (string)
          A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

       --rules (list)
          The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you want
          to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement that WAF  uses
          to  identify  matching  web requests, and parameters that govern how
          WAF handles them.

          (structure)
              A single rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or   RuleGroup  to
              identify  web requests that you want to manage in some way. Each
              rule includes one top-level  Statement that WAF uses to identify
              matching  web  requests, and parameters that govern how WAF han-
              dles them.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

                 If you change the name of a Rule after you create it and  you
                 want the rule's metric name to reflect the change, update the
                 metric name in  the  rule's  VisibilityConfig  settings.  WAF
                 doesn't  automatically update the metric name when you update
                 the rule name.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL , WAF  evaluates
                 each request against the Rules in order based on the value of
                 Priority . WAF processes rules with lower priority first. The
                 priorities don't need to be consecutive, but they must all be
                 different.

              Statement -> (structure)
                 The WAF  processing  statement  for  the  rule,  for  example
                 ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

                 ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule  statement that defines a string match search for
                     WAF to apply to web requests. The  byte  match  statement
                     provides  the  bytes  to  search for, the location in re-
                     quests that you want WAF to search, and  other  settings.
                     The  bytes to search for are typically a string that cor-
                     responds with ASCII characters. In the  WAF  console  and
                     the developer guide, this is called a string match state-
                     ment.

                     SearchString -> (blob)
                        A string value that you want WAF to  search  for.  WAF
                        searches  only  in  the  part of web requests that you
                        designate for inspection in  FieldToMatch . The  maxi-
                        mum length of the value is 200 bytes.

                        Valid  values depend on the component that you specify
                        for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                        o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to search
                          for.  This indicates the type of operation specified
                          in the request.

                        o UriPath : The value that you want WAF to search  for
                          in the URI path, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o JA3Fingerprint  :  Match  against  the request's JA3
                          fingerprint. The JA3 fingerprint is  a  32-character
                          hash  derived from the TLS Client Hello of an incom-
                          ing request. This fingerprint  serves  as  a  unique
                          identifier  for  the client's TLS configuration. You
                          can use this choice only with a string match  ByteM-
                          atchStatement  with  the PositionalConstraint set to
                          EXACTLY .  You can obtain the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                          client  requests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is
                          able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in
                          the  logs. For information about the logging fields,
                          see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        o HeaderOrder : The list of header names to match for.
                          WAF  creates a string that contains the ordered list
                          of header names, from the headers  in  the  web  re-
                          quest, and then matches against that string.

                        If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and
                        a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                            If you're using the WAF API

                        Specify a base64-encoded version  of  the  value.  The
                        maximum  length  of the value before you base64-encode
                        it is 200 bytes.

                        For example, suppose the value of Type is  HEADER  and
                        the  value  of  Data  is  User-Agent  . If you want to
                        search the User-Agent header for the  value  BadBot  ,
                        you  base64-encode  BadBot  using MIME base64-encoding
                        and include the resulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the
                        value of SearchString .
                            If  you're  using the CLI or one of the Amazon Web
                            Services SDKs

                        The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK au-
                        tomatically base64 encodes the value.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            For information about how to handle oversized  re-
                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-
                               ies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify ALL ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  cookies  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cookies nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                     PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                        The area within the portion of the  web  request  that
                        you want WAF to search for SearchString . Valid values
                        include the following:
                            CONTAINS

                        The specified part of the web request must include the
                        value  of SearchString , but the location doesn't mat-
                        ter.
                            CONTAINS_WORD

                        The specified part of the web request must include the
                        value  of SearchString , and SearchString must contain
                        only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z,  a-z,
                        0-9,  or _). In addition, SearchString must be a word,
                        which means that both of the following are true:

                        o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the  specified
                          part  of the web request or is preceded by a charac-
                          ter other than an alphanumeric character  or  under-
                          score  (_).  Examples  include the value of a header
                          and ;BadBot .

                        o SearchString is at the end of the specified part  of
                          the  web request or is followed by a character other
                          than an alphanumeric character  or  underscore  (_),
                          for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                            EXACTLY

                        The  value  of  the  specified part of the web request
                        must exactly match the value of SearchString .
                            STARTS_WITH

                        The value of SearchString must appear at the beginning
                        of the specified part of the web request.
                            ENDS_WITH

                        The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the end of
                        the specified part of the web request.

                 SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that inspects for  malicious  SQL  code.
                     Attackers  insert malicious SQL code into web requests to
                     do things like modify your database or extract data  from
                     it.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            quest bodies, see the Body object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            For information about how to handle oversized  re-
                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-

                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can

                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                     SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                        The sensitivity that you want WAF to  use  to  inspect
                        for SQL injection attacks.
                            HIGH detects more attacks, but might generate more
                            false positives, especially if your  web  requests
                            frequently  contain  unusual strings. For informa-
                            tion about identifying and mitigating false  posi-
                            tives, see Testing and tuning in the WAF Developer
                            Guide .

                            LOW is generally a  better  choice  for  resources
                            that  already  have  other protections against SQL
                            injection attacks or that have a low tolerance for
                            false positives.

                        Default: LOW

                 XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule  statement that inspects for cross-site scripting
                     (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses vulnera-
                     bilities in a benign website as a vehicle to inject mali-
                     cious  client-site  scripts  into  other  legitimate  web
                     browsers.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            quest bodies, see the Body object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            For information about how to handle oversized  re-
                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify ALL ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the

                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-

                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                 SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that compares a number of bytes  against
                     the size of a request component, using a comparison oper-
                     ator, such as greater than (>) or less than (<). For  ex-
                     ample,  you  can  use a size constraint statement to look
                     for query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                     If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF in-
                     spects  only  the  number  of bytes of the body up to the
                     limit for the web ACL. By default, for regional web ACLs,
                     this  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront web
                     ACLs, this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                     web ACLs, you can increase the limit in the web ACL Asso-
                     ciationConfig , for additional fees. If you know that the
                     request  body  for  your web requests should never exceed
                     the inspection limit, you could  use  a  size  constraint
                     statement  to  block  requests that have a larger request
                     body size.

                     If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to
                     filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one charac-
                     ter. For example, the URI /logo.jpg  is  nine  characters
                     long.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            For  information about how to handle oversized re-
                            quest bodies, see the Body object configuration.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            For information about how to handle oversized  re-
                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "ExcludedHead-
                               ers": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            cookies and only the first 200  cookies  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize cookie content in the Cookies object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  cook-
                            ies that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               cookies to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                               Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "IncludedCook-
                               ies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the cookies whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the cookies to  inspect  with  the
                               rule  inspection criteria. If you specify ALL ,
                               WAF inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  cookies  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cookies nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator to use to compare the request part to the
                        size setting.

                     Size -> (long)
                        The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, af-
                        ter any transformations.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                 GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement that labels web requests by country  and
                     region  and  that  matches  against web requests based on
                     country code. A geo match rule labels every request  that
                     it inspects regardless of whether it finds a match.

                     o To  manage  requests  only by country, you can use this
                       statement by itself and specify the countries that  you
                       want to match against in the CountryCodes array.

                     o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with Count ac-
                       tion so that it only labels requests. Then, add one  or
                       more  label match rules to run after the geo match rule
                       and configure them to match against the geographic  la-
                       bels and handle the requests as needed.

                     WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and region
                     codes from the International Organization  for  Standard-
                     ization (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF determines the codes us-
                     ing either the IP address in the web request  origin  or,
                     if  you  specify  it,  the  address in the geo match For-
                     wardedIPConfig .

                     If you use the web request origin, the label formats  are
                     awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO region
                     code> and awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO country  code>
                     .

                     If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label formats are
                     awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO re-
                     gion  code> and awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO coun-
                     try code> .

                     For additional details, see Geographic match rule  state-
                     ment in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     CountryCodes -> (list)
                        An  array of two-character country codes that you want
                        to match against, for example, [ "US", "CN" ]  ,  from
                        the alpha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                        tional standard.

                        When you use a geo match statement just for the region
                        and country labels that it adds to requests, you still
                        have to supply a country code for the rule  to  evalu-
                        ate.  In  this  case,  you  configure the rule to only
                        count matching requests, but it  will  still  generate
                        logging and count metrics for any matches. You can re-
                        duce the logging and metrics that the rule produces by
                        specifying a country that's unlikely to be a source of
                        traffic to your site.

                        (string)

                     ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in  an
                        HTTP  header that you specify, instead of using the IP
                        address that's reported by  the  web  request  origin.
                        Commonly,  this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If the specified header isn't present in  the  re-
                            quest,  WAF  doesn't apply the rule to the web re-
                            quest at all.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP  ad-
                            dress.  For  example,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The match status to assign to the web  request  if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                 RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule  statement used to run the rules that are defined
                     in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a rule  group  with
                     your  rules,  then  provide  the ARN of the rule group in
                     this statement.

                     You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for exam-
                     ple  for  use  inside a NotStatement or OrStatement . You
                     cannot use a rule group reference  statement  inside  an-
                     other  rule group. You can only reference a rule group as
                     a top-level statement within a rule that you define in  a
                     web ACL.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                     ExcludedRules -> (list)
                        Rules  in  the referenced rule group whose actions are
                        set to Count .

                        NOTE:
                            Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides  .
                            It  accepts  any  valid  action setting, including
                            Count .

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a single rule in a rule group whose  ac-
                            tion you want to override to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               . It accepts any valid action setting,  includ-
                               ing Count .

                            Name -> (string)

                     RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                        Action settings to use in the place of  the  rule  ac-
                        tions  that  are configured inside the rule group. You
                        specify one override for each rule  whose  action  you
                        want to change.

                        You can use overrides for testing, for example you can
                        override all of rule actions to Count and then monitor
                        the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule
                        group would handle your web traffic. You can also per-
                        manently  override  some or all actions, to modify how
                        the rule group manages your web traffic.

                            how the rule group would handle your web  traffic.
                            You  can also permanently override some or all ac-
                            tions, to modify how the rule group  manages  your
                            web traffic.

                 IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to detect web requests coming  from
                     particular  IP  addresses or address ranges. To use this,
                     create an  IPSet that specifies the addresses you want to
                     detect,  then  use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                     To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                     Each IP set rule statement references an IP set. You cre-
                     ate  and maintain the set independent of your rules. This
                     allows you to use the single set in multiple rules.  When
                     you  update the referenced set, WAF automatically updates
                     all rules that reference it.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that this
                        statement references.

                     IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  for  inspecting IP addresses in an
                        HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the  IP
                        address  that's  reported  by  the web request origin.
                        Commonly, this is the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If  the  specified header isn't present in the re-
                            quest, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web  re-
                            quest at all.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The  name of the HTTP header to use for the IP ad-
                            dress. For example,  to  use  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The  match  status to assign to the web request if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                        Position -> (string)
                            The position in the header to search  for  the  IP
                            address.  The  header  can contain IP addresses of
                            the original client and also of proxies. For exam-
                            ple,   the   header   value   could  be  10.1.1.1,
                            127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10 where the first IP  address
                            identifies  the original client and the rest iden-
                            tify proxies that the request went through.

                            The options for this setting are the following:

                            o FIRST - Inspect the first IP address in the list
                              of  IP  addresses in the header. This is usually
                              the client's original IP.

                            o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in  the  list
                              of IP addresses in the header.

                            o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the header for
                              a match. If the header contains more than 10  IP
                              addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

                 RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                     A  rule  statement  used to search web request components
                     for matches with regular expressions. To use this, create
                     a   RegexPatternSet  that  specifies the expressions that
                     you want to detect, then use the ARN of that set in  this
                     statement.  A  web  request  matches the pattern set rule
                     statement if the request component  matches  any  of  the
                     patterns  in  the set. To create a regex pattern set, see
                     CreateRegexPatternSet .

                     Each regex pattern set rule statement references a  regex
                     pattern  set. You create and maintain the set independent
                     of your rules. This allows you to use the single  set  in
                     multiple  rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                     automatically updates all rules that reference it.

                     ARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPatternSet
                        that this statement references.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure

                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can

                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an effort to bypass detection.

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                 RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                     A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate  lim-
                     its requests when they are coming at too fast a rate. The
                     rule categorizes requests according to  your  aggregation
                     criteria,  collects  them into aggregation instances, and
                     counts and rate limits the requests for each instance.

                     You can specify individual aggregation keys, like IP  ad-
                     dress  or  HTTP  method. You can also specify aggregation
                     key combinations, like IP address  and  HTTP  method,  or
                     HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

                     Each  unique  set of values for the aggregation keys that
                     you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with  the
                     value  from  each key contributing to the aggregation in-
                     stance definition.

                     For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests  with
                     the following IP address and HTTP method values:

                     o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                     o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                     o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                     o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                     The rule would create different aggregation instances ac-
                     cording to your aggregation criteria, for example:

                     o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the  IP  address,
                       then  each  individual  address  is  an aggregation in-
                       stance, and WAF counts requests  separately  for  each.
                       The  aggregation  instances  and request counts for our
                       example would be the following:

                       o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                       o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                     o If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method,  then  each
                       individual  HTTP method is an aggregation instance. The
                       aggregation instances and request counts for our  exam-
                       ple would be the following:

                       o HTTP method POST: count 2

                       o HTTP method GET: count 2

                     o If  the  aggregation  criteria  is  IP address and HTTP
                       method, then each IP address and each HTTP method would
                       contribute  to  the  combined aggregation instance. The
                       aggregation instances and request counts for our  exam-
                       ple would be the following:

                       o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

                       o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

                       o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

                     For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combina-
                     tion of values for the keys defines a  separate  aggrega-
                     tion instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits individu-
                     ally.

                     You can optionally  nest  another  statement  inside  the
                     rate-based  statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so
                     that it only counts and rate limits requests  that  match
                     the  nested statement. You can use this nested scope-down
                     statement in conjunction with your aggregation key speci-
                     fications  or  you  can just count and rate limit all re-
                     quests that match the scope-down statement, without addi-
                     tional  aggregation.  When  you choose to just manage all
                     requests that match a scope-down statement, the  aggrega-
                     tion instance is singular for the rule.

                     You  cannot  nest  a  RateBasedStatement  inside  another
                     statement, for example inside a NotStatement or  OrState-
                     ment  .  You can define a RateBasedStatement inside a web
                     ACL and inside a rule group.

                     For additional information about the  options,  see  Rate
                     limiting  web  requests using rate-based rules in the WAF
                     Developer Guide .

                     If you only aggregate on the  individual  IP  address  or
                     forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP ad-
                     dresses that WAF is currently rate limiting  for  a  rule
                     through  the  API call GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys .
                     This option is not available for other  aggregation  con-
                     figurations.

                     WAF  tracks  and manages web requests separately for each
                     instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For  example,
                     if  you  provide the same rate-based rule settings in two
                     web ACLs, each of the two rule  statements  represents  a
                     separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own
                     tracking  and  management  by  WAF.  If  you   define   a
                     rate-based  rule  inside  a rule group, and then use that
                     rule group in multiple places, each use creates  a  sepa-
                     rate  instance  of  the rate-based rule that gets its own
                     tracking and management by WAF.

                     Limit -> (long)
                        The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a single
                        aggregation  instance  for the rate-based rule. If the
                        rate-based statement includes a  ScopeDownStatement  ,
                        this  limit is applied only to the requests that match
                        the statement.

                        Examples:

                        o If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is the
                          limit on requests from any single IP address.

                        o If  you  aggregate  on the HTTP method and the query
                          argument name "city", then this is the limit on  re-
                          quests for any single method, city pair.

                     EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                        The  amount  of  time, in seconds, that WAF should in-
                        clude in its request counts,  looking  back  from  the
                        current  time. For example, for a setting of 120, when
                        WAF checks the rate, it counts the requests for the  2
                        minutes  immediately preceding the current time. Valid
                        settings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

                        This setting doesn't determine how  often  WAF  checks
                        the  rate,  but  how  far  back  it looks each time it
                        checks. WAF checks the rate about every 10 seconds.

                        Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                     AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                        Setting that indicates how to  aggregate  the  request
                        counts.

                        NOTE:
                            Web  requests  that  are missing any of the compo-
                            nents specified in the aggregation keys are  omit-
                            ted  from  the rate-based rule evaluation and han-
                            dling.

                        o CONSTANT - Count and limit the requests  that  match
                          the  rate-based  rule's  scope-down  statement. With
                          this option, the counted requests aren't further ag-
                          gregated. The scope-down statement is the only spec-
                          ification used. When the count of all requests  that
                          satisfy  the  scope-down  statement  goes  over  the
                          limit, WAF applies the rule action to  all  requests
                          that  satisfy  the  scope-down statement.  With this
                          option, you must  configure  the  ScopeDownStatement
                          property.

                        o CUSTOM_KEYS - Aggregate the request counts using one
                          or more web  request  components  as  the  aggregate
                          keys.  With this option, you must specify the aggre-
                          gate keys in the CustomKeys property.  To  aggregate
                          on  only the IP address or only the forwarded IP ad-
                          dress, don't use custom keys. Instead, set  the  ag-
                          gregate key type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                        o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts on the
                          first IP address in an HTTP header.  With  this  op-
                          tion, you must specify the header to use in the For-
                          wardedIPConfig property.  To aggregate on a combina-
                          tion  of  the forwarded IP address with other aggre-
                          gate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                        o IP - Aggregate the request counts on the IP  address
                          from  the web request origin. To aggregate on a com-
                          bination of the  IP  address  with  other  aggregate
                          keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                     ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                        An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of
                        the web requests that are evaluated and managed by the
                        rate-based statement. When you use a scope-down state-
                        ment, the rate-based rule only tracks and rate  limits
                        requests  that match the scope-down statement. You can
                        use any nestable  Statement in the  scope-down  state-
                        ment,  and  you  can nest statements at any level, the
                        same as you can for a rule statement.

                        ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string  match
                            search  for WAF to apply to web requests. The byte
                            match statement provides the bytes to search  for,
                            the  location  in  requests  that  you want WAF to
                            search, and other settings. The  bytes  to  search
                            for  are  typically a string that corresponds with
                            ASCII characters. In the WAF console and  the  de-
                            veloper  guide,  this  is  called  a  string match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF  searches  only in the part of web requests
                               that you designate for  inspection  in   Field-
                               ToMatch  .  The  maximum length of the value is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid values depend on the component  that  you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath  :  The  value  that  you want WAF to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               o JA3Fingerprint  : Match against the request's
                                 JA3 fingerprint. The  JA3  fingerprint  is  a
                                 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client
                                 Hello of an incoming  request.  This  finger-
                                 print  serves  as a unique identifier for the
                                 client's TLS configuration. You can use  this
                                 choice  only  with  a string match ByteMatch-
                                 Statement with the  PositionalConstraint  set
                                 to  EXACTLY .  You can obtain the JA3 finger-
                                 print for client requests from  the  web  ACL
                                 logs. If WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                 print, it includes it in the logs. For infor-
                                 mation  about  the  logging  fields,  see Log
                                 fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               o HeaderOrder : The list  of  header  names  to
                                 match for. WAF creates a string that contains
                                 the ordered list of header  names,  from  the
                                 headers  in the web request, and then matches
                                 against that string.

                               If SearchString includes alphabetic  characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify a base64-encoded version of the  value.
                               The  maximum  length  of  the  value before you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type  is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you want to search the  User-Agent  header  for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing MIME base64-encoding and  include  the  re-
                               sulting  value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value of
                               SearchString .
                                   If you're using the CLI or one of the  Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The  value that you want WAF to search for. The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-

                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text

                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The  area within the portion of the web request
                               that you want WAF to search for SearchString  .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The  specified part of the web request must in-
                               clude the value of SearchString ,  and  Search-
                               String  must  contain only alphanumeric charac-
                               ters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9,  or  _).  In
                               addition,  SearchString  must  be a word, which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified  part of the web request or is preceded
                                 by a character  other  than  an  alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString is at the end of  the  specified
                                 part  of  the web request or is followed by a
                                 character other than an alphanumeric  charac-
                                 ter  or  underscore (_), for example, BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The value of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest  must  exactly match the value of Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               beginning  of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The value of SearchString must  appear  at  the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that inspects for malicious SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-
                                   ject configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two

                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate  more  false  positives,  especially if
                                   your web requests  frequently  contain  un-
                                   usual  strings. For information about iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see
                                   Testing  and  tuning  in  the WAF Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   LOW is generally a better  choice  for  re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against SQL injection attacks or that  have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  that  inspects  for cross-site
                            scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS attacks,  the  at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a vehicle to inject malicious client-site  scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-
                                          mentation JavaScript Object Notation
                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that compares a number  of  bytes
                            against  the  size of a request component, using a
                            comparison operator, such as greater than  (>)  or
                            less  than  (<).  For  example, you can use a size
                            constraint statement to  look  for  query  strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If  you configure WAF to inspect the request body,
                            WAF inspects only the number of bytes of the  body
                            up  to  the limit for the web ACL. By default, for
                            regional web ACLs,  this  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                            bytes)  and for CloudFront web ACLs, this limit is
                            16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront web ACLs, you
                            can increase the limit in the web ACL Association-
                            Config , for additional fees. If you know that the
                            request  body  for  your web requests should never
                            exceed the inspection limit, you could use a  size
                            constraint statement to block requests that have a
                            larger request body size.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest  to  filter  on,  the  slash  (/) in the URI
                            counts as one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   sized  request bodies, see the JsonBody ob-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-

                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-

                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)

                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The size, in byte, to compare  to  the  request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try  and  region  and that matches against web re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels  every request that it inspects regardless of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To manage requests only by country, you can  use
                              this  statement  by itself and specify the coun-
                              tries that you want  to  match  against  in  the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise,  configure  your  geo match rule with
                              Count action so that it  only  labels  requests.
                              Then,  add  one or more label match rules to run
                              after the geo match rule and configure  them  to
                              match  against  the geographic labels and handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country  and
                            region  codes  from the International Organization
                            for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.  WAF  de-
                            termines  the codes using either the IP address in
                            the web request origin or, if you specify it,  the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If  you use the web request origin, the label for-
                            mats are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO  country
                            code>-<ISO    region   code>   and   awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If you use a forwarded IP address, the label  for-
                            mats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO coun-
                            try  code>-<ISO  region  code>   and   awswaf:for-
                            wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            For  additional details, see Geographic match rule
                            statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An array of two-character  country  codes  that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN" ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes  of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region and country labels that it adds  to  re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for the rule to evaluate.  In  this  case,  you
                               configure  the  rule to only count matching re-
                               quests, but it will still generate logging  and
                               count  metrics  for any matches. You can reduce
                               the logging and metrics that the rule  produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The configuration for inspecting  IP  addresses
                               in  an HTTP header that you specify, instead of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request  origin.  Commonly,  this is the X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header, but  you  can  specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the request doesn't have a valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to run the  rules  that  are
                            defined  in  a   RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                            rule group with your rules, then provide  the  ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                            for example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement  or
                            OrStatement  .  You cannot use a rule group refer-
                            ence statement inside another rule group. You  can
                            only  reference a rule group as a top-level state-
                            ment within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules in the referenced rule  group  whose  ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides . It accepts any  valid  action  set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  single  rule  in a rule group
                                   whose action you want to override to  Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the rule whose action you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions  that  are  configured  inside the rule

                               you can override all of rule actions  to  Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your

                               some or all actions, to  modify  how  the  rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                                                    Value -> (string)
                                                        The value of the  cus-
                                                        tom header.

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule statement used to detect web requests com-
                            ing  from  particular  IP  addresses  or   address
                            ranges.  To use this, create an  IPSet that speci-
                            fies the addresses you want to  detect,  then  use
                            the  ARN  of that set in this statement. To create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each IP set rule statement references an  IP  set.
                            You  create  and  maintain  the set independent of
                            your rules. This allows you to use the single  set
                            in  multiple rules. When you update the referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the  IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The configuration for inspecting  IP  addresses
                               in  an HTTP header that you specify, instead of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request  origin.  Commonly,  this is the X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header, but  you  can  specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the request doesn't have a valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The position in the header  to  search  for
                                   the  IP  address. The header can contain IP
                                   addresses of the original client  and  also
                                   of  proxies.  For example, the header value
                                   could be 10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10
                                   where  the  first IP address identifies the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The  options  for this setting are the fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST - Inspect the first IP  address  in
                                     the  list  of IP addresses in the header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY  -  Inspect  all  IP addresses in the
                                     header for a match. If  the  header  con-
                                     tains  more than 10 IP addresses, WAF in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions  that you want to detect, then use the
                            ARN of that set in this statement. A  web  request
                            matches  the pattern set rule statement if the re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set.  To  create  a  regex  pattern set, see  Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent of your rules. This allows you to  use
                            the  single set in multiple rules. When you update
                            the referenced set, WAF automatically updates  all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the  Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings

                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rate-based  rule  counts  incoming requests and
                            rate limits requests when they are coming  at  too
                            fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests accord-
                            ing to your aggregation  criteria,  collects  them
                            into  aggregation  instances,  and counts and rate
                            limits the requests for each instance.

                            You can specify individual aggregation keys,  like
                            IP  address  or  HTTP method. You can also specify
                            aggregation key combinations, like IP address  and
                            HTTP  method,  or HTTP method, query argument, and
                            cookie.

                            Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys
                            that  you  specify  is  a separate aggregation in-
                            stance, with the value from each key  contributing
                            to the aggregation instance definition.

                            For  example,  assume  the  rule evaluates web re-
                            quests with the  following  IP  address  and  HTTP
                            method values:

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            The  rule  would  create different aggregation in-
                            stances according to  your  aggregation  criteria,
                            for example:

                            o If  the  aggregation criteria is just the IP ad-
                              dress, then each individual address is an aggre-
                              gation  instance,  and WAF counts requests sepa-
                              rately for each. The aggregation  instances  and
                              request counts for our example would be the fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                              o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                            o If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then
                              each  individual  HTTP  method is an aggregation
                              instance. The aggregation instances and  request
                              counts for our example would be the following:

                              o HTTP method POST: count 2

                              o HTTP method GET: count 2

                            o If  the  aggregation  criteria is IP address and
                              HTTP method, then each IP address and each  HTTP
                              method would contribute to the combined aggrega-
                              tion instance. The aggregation instances and re-
                              quest  counts  for our example would be the fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

                              o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST:  count
                                1

                            For  any  n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique
                            combination of values for the keys defines a sepa-
                            rate  aggregation  instance,  which WAF counts and
                            rate-limits individually.

                            You can optionally nest another  statement  inside
                            the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the scope of
                            the rule so that it only counts  and  rate  limits
                            requests  that match the nested statement. You can
                            use this nested scope-down statement  in  conjunc-
                            tion  with  your aggregation key specifications or
                            you can just count and  rate  limit  all  requests
                            that match the scope-down statement, without addi-
                            tional aggregation. When you choose to just manage
                            all  requests  that  match a scope-down statement,
                            the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                            You cannot nest a  RateBasedStatement  inside  an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or OrStatement . You can define a  RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            For  additional information about the options, see
                            Rate limiting web requests using rate-based  rules
                            in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            If you only aggregate on the individual IP address
                            or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list
                            of  IP addresses that WAF is currently rate limit-
                            ing for a rule through the API call  GetRateBased-
                            StatementManagedKeys  .  This option is not avail-
                            able for other aggregation configurations.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each  instance  of a rate-based rule that you use.
                            For example, if you provide  the  same  rate-based
                            rule  settings  in  two  web ACLs, each of the two
                            rule statements represents a separate instance  of
                            the  rate-based rule and gets its own tracking and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside  a rule group, and then use that rule group
                            in multiple places, each use  creates  a  separate
                            instance  of the rate-based rule that gets its own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single  aggregation instance for the rate-based
                               rule. If the rate-based  statement  includes  a
                               ScopeDownStatement , this limit is applied only
                               to the requests that match the statement.

                               Examples:

                               o If you aggregate on just the IP address, this
                                 is  the  limit on requests from any single IP
                                 address.

                               o If you aggregate on the HTTP method  and  the
                                 query  argument name "city", then this is the
                                 limit on requests for any single method, city
                                 pair.

                            EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should
                               include in its  request  counts,  looking  back
                               from  the current time. For example, for a set-
                               ting of 120,  when  WAF  checks  the  rate,  it
                               counts  the  requests for the 2 minutes immedi-
                               ately preceding the current  time.  Valid  set-
                               tings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

                               This  setting  doesn't  determine how often WAF
                               checks the rate, but how far back it looks each
                               time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every
                               10 seconds.

                               Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts.

                               NOTE:
                                   Web  requests  that  are missing any of the
                                   components  specified  in  the  aggregation
                                   keys  are  omitted from the rate-based rule
                                   evaluation and handling.

                               o CONSTANT - Count and limit the requests  that
                                 match the rate-based rule's scope-down state-
                                 ment. With this option, the counted  requests
                                 aren't  further  aggregated.  The  scope-down
                                 statement is  the  only  specification  used.
                                 When  the  count of all requests that satisfy
                                 the scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                 WAF  applies  the rule action to all requests
                                 that satisfy the scope-down statement.   With
                                 this  option,  you  must configure the Scope-
                                 DownStatement property.

                               o CUSTOM_KEYS - Aggregate  the  request  counts
                                 using  one  or more web request components as
                                 the aggregate keys.  With  this  option,  you
                                 must  specify  the aggregate keys in the Cus-
                                 tomKeys property.  To aggregate on  only  the
                                 IP  address or only the forwarded IP address,
                                 don't use custom keys. Instead, set  the  ag-
                                 gregate key type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                               o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts
                                 on the first IP address in  an  HTTP  header.
                                 With this option, you must specify the header
                                 to use in the ForwardedIPConfig property.  To
                                 aggregate  on  a combination of the forwarded
                                 IP address with  other  aggregate  keys,  use
                                 CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This is required if you specify a forwarded  IP
                               in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the HTTP header to use for the
                                   IP address. For example, to use the  X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:

                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the request doesn't have a valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            CustomKeys -> (list)
                               Specifies  the  aggregate  keys  to  use  in  a
                               rate-base rule.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single custom aggregate key for
                                   a rate-base rule.

                                   NOTE:

                                      components  specified in the aggregation
                                      keys are  omitted  from  the  rate-based

                                   Header -> (structure)
                                      Use the value of a header in the request
                                      as an aggregate key. Each distinct value
                                      in  the header contributes to the aggre-
                                      gation instance. If  you  use  a  single
                                      header  as  your  custom  key, then each
                                      value fully defines an  aggregation  in-
                                      stance.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the header to use.

                                      Use  the request's HTTP method as an ag-
                                      gregate key. Each distinct  HTTP  method
                                      contributes to the aggregation instance.

                                   ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                      Use the first  IP  address  in  an  HTTP
                                      header  as  an  aggregate key. Each dis-
                                      tinct forwarded IP  address  contributes
                                      to the aggregation instance.

                                      When  you  specify an IP or forwarded IP
                                      in the custom  key  settings,  you  must
                                      also  specify  at least one other key to
                                      use. You can aggregate on only the  for-
                                      warded  IP  address  by  specifying FOR-
                                      WARDED_IP in your rate-based statement's
                                      AggregateKeyType .

                                      With  this  option, you must specify the
                                      header to use in the  rate-based  rule's
                                      ForwardedIPConfig property.

                                   IP -> (structure)
                                      Use the request's originating IP address
                                      as an aggregate key.  Each  distinct  IP
                                      address  contributes  to the aggregation
                                      instance.

                                      When you specify an IP or  forwarded  IP
                                      in  the  custom  key  settings, you must
                                      also specify at least one other  key  to
                                      use.  You  can  aggregate on only the IP
                                      address  by  specifying   IP   in   your
                                      rate-based  statement's AggregateKeyType
                                      .

                                      Use the specified label namespace as  an
                                      aggregate key. Each distinct fully qual-
                                      ified label name that has the  specified
                                      label  namespace  contributes to the ag-
                                      gregation instance. If you use just  one
                                      label namespace as your custom key, then
                                      each label name fully defines an  aggre-
                                      gation instance.

                                      This  uses  only  labels  that have been
                                      added to the request by rules  that  are
                                      evaluated before this rate-based rule in
                                      the web ACL.

                                      Use the request's URI path as an  aggre-
                                      gate  key.  Each  distinct URI path con-
                                      tributes to the aggregation instance. If
                                      you use just the URI path as your custom
                                      key, then each URI path fully defines an

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to run the  rules  that  are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the  rule
                            group  in this statement. You can retrieve the re-
                            quired names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRule-
                            Groups .

                            You  cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for
                            example for use inside a NotStatement or  OrState-
                            ment  . You cannot use a managed rule group inside
                            another rule group. You can only reference a  man-
                            aged  rule group as a top-level statement within a
                            rule that you define in a web ACL.

                               The name of the managed rule group vendor.  You
                               use  this,  along  with the rule group name, to
                               identify a rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the managed  rule  group.  You  use
                               this,  along  with the vendor name, to identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The version of the managed rule group  to  use.
                               If  you  specify  this,  the version setting is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this,  WAF  uses  the vendor's default version,
                               and then keeps the version at the vendor's  de-
                               fault  when the vendor updates the managed rule
                               group settings.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules in the referenced rule  group  whose  ac-

                               mitigation require additional configuration:

                               o Use the AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet configura-
                                 tion object to configure the account creation
                                 fraud prevention managed rule group. The con-

                                 phone number fields.

                               o Use  the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet configura-
                                 tion object to configure the account takeover
                                 prevention managed rule group. The configura-
                                 tion includes the sign-in page of your appli-
                                 cation and the locations in the login request
                                 payload of data  such  as  the  username  and

                                     the registration  and  sign-up  pages  of
                                     your application and the locations in the
                                     account creation request payload of data,
                                     such  as  the user email and phone number
                                     fields.

                                   o Use the AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet config-
                                     uration  object  to configure the account
                                     takeover prevention managed  rule  group.
                                     The  configuration  includes  the sign-in
                                     page of your application  and  the  loca-
                                     tions  in  the  login  request payload of
                                     data such as the username and password.

                                   o Use the  AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet
                                     configuration  object  to  configure  the
                                     protection level that you  want  the  Bot
                                     Control rule group to use.

                                          The path of the login  endpoint  for
                                          your  application.  For example, for
                                          the URL  https://example.com/web/lo-
                                          gin  ,  you  would  provide the path
                                          /web/login . Login paths that  start
                                          with  the  path that you provide are
                                          considered  a  match.  For   example
                                          /web/login  matches  the login paths
                                          /web/login    ,    /web/login/     ,
                                          /web/loginPage    ,   and   /web/lo-
                                          gin/thisPage , but doesn't match the
                                          login  path /home/web/login or /web-
                                          site/login .

                                          The rule group  inspects  only  HTTP

                                      RequestInspection -> (structure)
                                          The criteria  for  inspecting  login
                                          requests, used by the ATP rule group
                                          to validate credentials usage.

                                          PayloadType -> (string)
                                             The payload type for  your  login
                                             endpoint, either JSON or form en-

                                          UsernameField -> (structure)
                                             The name of the field in the  re-
                                             quest  payload that contains your
                                             customer's username.

                                             How you specify this  depends  on
                                             the  request  inspection  payload
                                             type.

                                             o For JSON payloads, specify  the
                                               field name in JSON pointer syn-
                                               tax. For information about  the

                                               .   For  example,  for the JSON
                                               payload { "form": { "username":
                                               "THE_USERNAME"  } } , the user-

                                               /form/username .

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use the HTML  form  names.  For
                                               example,  for an HTML form with
                                               the input element  named  user-

                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully qualified labels  have  a  prefix,  optional
                            namespaces,  and label name. The prefix identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added  the  label. If you do not provide the fully
                            qualified name in your  label  match  string,  WAF
                            performs  the search for labels that were added in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-
                               bel name or just the namespace.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  string  to  match against. The setting you
                               provide for this depends on  the  match  state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If  the  Scope  indicates  LABEL  , then this
                                 specification must include the name  and  can
                                 include  any  number  of  preceding namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If  the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then this
                                 specification can include any number of  con-
                                 tiguous  namespace  strings,  and can include
                                 the entire label namespace  prefix  from  the
                                 rule  group or web ACL where the label origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels are case sensitive and components  of  a
                               label  must  be separated by colon, for example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                        RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-
                                   ject configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  for  inspecting IP addresses in an
                        HTTP header that you specify, instead of using the  IP
                        address  that's  reported  by  the web request origin.
                        Commonly, this is the  X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                        but you can specify any header name.

                        NOTE:
                            If  the  specified header isn't present in the re-
                            quest, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web  re-
                            quest at all.

                        This  is required if you specify a forwarded IP in the
                        rule's aggregate key settings.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header to use for the IP  ad-
                            dress.  For  example,  to  use the X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, set this to X-Forwarded-For .

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The match status to assign to the web  request  if
                            the request doesn't have a valid IP address in the
                            specified position.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                     CustomKeys -> (list)
                        Specifies  the  aggregate  keys  to use in a rate-base
                        rule.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a single  custom  aggregate  key  for  a
                            rate-base rule.

                            NOTE:
                               Web requests that are missing any of the compo-
                               nents specified in  the  aggregation  keys  are
                               omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and
                               handling.

                            Header -> (structure)
                               Use the value of a header in the request as  an
                               aggregate  key.  Each  distinct  value  in  the
                               header contributes to the aggregation instance.
                               If  you use a single header as your custom key,
                               then each value fully  defines  an  aggregation
                               instance.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the header to use.

                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            HTTPMethod -> (structure)
                               Use  the  request's HTTP method as an aggregate
                               key. Each distinct HTTP method  contributes  to
                               the  aggregation  instance. If you use just the
                               HTTP method  as  your  custom  key,  then  each
                               method fully defines an aggregation instance.

                            ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                               Use  the  first IP address in an HTTP header as
                               an aggregate key. Each  distinct  forwarded  IP
                               address  contributes  to  the  aggregation  in-
                               stance.

                               When you specify an IP or forwarded IP  in  the
                               custom  key  settings, you must also specify at
                               least one other key to use. You  can  aggregate
                               on  only the forwarded IP address by specifying
                               FORWARDED_IP in your rate-based statement's Ag-
                               gregateKeyType .

                               With  this  option, you must specify the header
                               to use in the rate-based rule's ForwardedIPCon-
                               fig property.

                            IP -> (structure)
                               Use  the request's originating IP address as an
                               aggregate key. Each distinct  IP  address  con-
                               tributes to the aggregation instance.

                               When  you  specify an IP or forwarded IP in the
                               custom key settings, you must also  specify  at
                               least  one  other key to use. You can aggregate
                               on only the IP address by specifying IP in your
                               rate-based statement's AggregateKeyType .

                            LabelNamespace -> (structure)
                               Use  the specified label namespace as an aggre-
                               gate key. Each distinct fully  qualified  label
                               name  that  has  the  specified label namespace
                               contributes to the aggregation instance. If you
                               use  just  one  label  namespace as your custom
                               key, then each label name fully defines an  ag-
                               gregation instance.

                               This  uses  only labels that have been added to
                               the request by rules that are evaluated  before
                               this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

                               For  information  about  label  namespaces  and
                               names, see Label syntax and naming requirements
                               in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               Namespace -> (string)
                                   The namespace to use for aggregation.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Use the request's URI path as an aggregate key.
                               Each distinct URI path contributes to  the  ag-
                               gregation  instance.  If  you  use just the URI
                               path as your custom key,  then  each  URI  path
                               fully defines an aggregation instance.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                 AndStatement -> (structure)
                     A logical rule  statement  used  to  combine  other  rule
                     statements  with  AND  logic.  You  provide more than one
                     Statement within the AndStatement .

                     Statements -> (list)
                        The statements to combine with AND logic. You can  use
                        any statements that can be nested.

                        (structure)
                            The  processing guidance for a  Rule , used by WAF
                            to determine whether a  web  request  matches  the
                            rule.

                            For  example specifications, see the examples sec-
                            tion of  CreateWebACL .

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  for  WAF  to apply to web requests. The
                               byte match  statement  provides  the  bytes  to
                               search  for,  the location in requests that you
                               want WAF to search,  and  other  settings.  The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds with ASCII characters. In  the  WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A string value that you want WAF to  search
                                   for.  WAF  searches only in the part of web
                                   requests that you designate for  inspection
                                   in   FieldToMatch  .  The maximum length of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid values depend on the  component  that
                                   you  specify for inspection in FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method : The HTTP method  that  you  want
                                     WAF  to  search  for.  This indicates the
                                     type of operation specified  in  the  re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF to
                                     search for in the URI path, for  example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   o JA3Fingerprint  :  Match  against the re-
                                     quest's JA3 fingerprint. The JA3  finger-
                                     print is a 32-character hash derived from
                                     the TLS Client Hello of an  incoming  re-
                                     quest.   This  fingerprint  serves  as  a
                                     unique identifier for  the  client's  TLS
                                     configuration.  You  can  use this choice
                                     only with a string match  ByteMatchState-
                                     ment with the PositionalConstraint set to
                                     EXACTLY .  You can obtain the JA3 finger-
                                     print  for  client  requests from the web
                                     ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the
                                     fingerprint,  it includes it in the logs.
                                     For information about the logging fields,
                                     see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide
                                     .

                                   o HeaderOrder : The list of header names to
                                     match for. WAF creates a string that con-
                                     tains the ordered list of  header  names,
                                     from  the headers in the web request, and
                                     then matches against that string.

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the

                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-

                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as
                                      they  appear in the web request that WAF
                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter  hash  derived from the TLS Client
                                      Hello of an incoming request. This  fin-
                                      gerprint  serves  as a unique identifier
                                      for the client's TLS configuration.  WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each request that has enough TLS  Client
                                      Hello  information  for the calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You can obtain the JA3  fingerprint  for
                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation

                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)

                               PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                   The  area within the portion of the web re-
                                   quest that  you  want  WAF  to  search  for
                                   SearchString  .  Valid  values  include the
                                   following:
                                      CONTAINS

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include  the  value  of  SearchString , and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _). In addition,  SearchString  must  be  a
                                   word,  which means that both of the follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the
                                     specified  part  of the web request or is
                                     preceded by a character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric  character  or underscore (_).
                                     Examples include the value  of  a  header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString  is at the end of the speci-
                                     fied part of the web request or  is  fol-

                                   The  value of the specified part of the web
                                   request must exactly  match  the  value  of
                                   SearchString .
                                      STARTS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the beginning of the specified part of  the
                                   web request.
                                      ENDS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the end of the specified part  of  the  web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that inspects for malicious
                               SQL code. Attackers insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to

                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match

                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text

                               SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                                   The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to
                                   inspect for SQL injection attacks.
                                      HIGH  detects  more  attacks,  but might
                                      generate  more  false  positives,  espe-
                                      cially  if  your web requests frequently
                                      contain unusual strings. For information

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources that already have other  protec-
                                      tions  against  SQL injection attacks or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement that inspects for cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) attacks. In  XSS  attacks,  the
                               attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign web-
                               site  as  a   vehicle   to   inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-
                                             net Engineering Task Force (IETF)

                                             Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request

                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes  of
                               the  body  up  to the limit for the web ACL. By
                               default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8
                               KB  (8,192  bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs,
                               this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  Cloud-
                               Front  web  ACLs, you can increase the limit in
                               the web ACL AssociationConfig , for  additional
                               fees.  If  you  know  that the request body for
                               your web requests should never exceed  the  in-
                               spection limit, you could use a size constraint
                               statement to block requests that have a  larger
                               request body size.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)

                                          you   specify   ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-

                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The  operator to use to compare the request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The size, in byte, to compare  to  the  re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting

                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation

                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that labels  web  requests  by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests based on country  code.  A  geo  match
                               rule  labels every request that it inspects re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To manage requests only by country,  you  can
                                 use  this statement by itself and specify the
                                 countries that you want to match  against  in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then,  add  one  or more label match rules to
                                 run after the geo match  rule  and  configure
                                 them  to  match against the geographic labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF labels requests using the  alpha-2  country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF  determines  the  codes using either the IP
                               address in the web request origin  or,  if  you
                               specify  it,  the address in the geo match For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If you use the web request  origin,  the  label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If  you  use  a forwarded IP address, the label
                               formats are  awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               For additional details,  see  Geographic  match
                               rule statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An  array  of  two-character  country codes
                                   that you want to match against,  for  exam-
                                   ple,  [  "US",  "CN"  ]  , from the alpha-2
                                   country ISO codes of the ISO 3166  interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the region and country labels that it  adds
                                   to  requests,  you  still  have to supply a
                                   country code for the rule to  evaluate.  In
                                   this  case,  you configure the rule to only
                                   count matching requests, but it will  still
                                   generate  logging and count metrics for any
                                   matches. You can  reduce  the  logging  and
                                   metrics  that the rule produces by specify-
                                   ing a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be  a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  . You cannot use a rule group ref-
                               erence statement inside another rule group. You
                               can  only reference a rule group as a top-level
                               statement within a rule that you  define  in  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules in the referenced  rule  group  whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                   Action settings to use in the place of  the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   (structure)

                                                           ,  WAF  inserts the

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the
                                                           custom header.

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of

                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule counts incoming requests  and
                               rate  limits  requests  when they are coming at
                               too fast a rate. The rule categorizes  requests
                               according  to  your  aggregation criteria, col-
                               lects  them  into  aggregation  instances,  and
                               counts  and  rate  limits the requests for each
                               instance.

                               You can specify  individual  aggregation  keys,
                               like  IP  address  or HTTP method. You can also
                               specify aggregation key combinations,  like  IP
                               address  and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query
                               argument, and cookie.

                               Each unique set of values for  the  aggregation
                               keys that you specify is a separate aggregation
                               instance, with the value  from  each  key  con-
                               tributing  to  the aggregation instance defini-
                               tion.

                               For example, assume the rule evaluates web  re-
                               quests  with  the following IP address and HTTP
                               method values:

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               The rule would create different aggregation in-
                               stances according to your aggregation criteria,
                               for example:

                               o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the  IP
                                 address,  then  each individual address is an
                                 aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
                                 separately  for  each.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances and request counts  for  our  example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                 o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                               o If  the  aggregation criteria is HTTP method,
                                 then each individual HTTP method is an aggre-
                                 gation  instance.  The  aggregation instances
                                 and request counts for our example  would  be
                                 the following:

                                 o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                 o HTTP method GET: count 2

                               o If the aggregation criteria is IP address and
                                 HTTP method, then each IP  address  and  each
                                 HTTP  method would contribute to the combined
                                 aggregation  instance.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances  and  request  counts for our example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP  address  10.1.1.1,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count
                                   2

                                 o IP address  127.0.0.0,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                               For  any  n-tuple  of  aggregation  keys,  each
                               unique combination of values for the  keys  de-
                               fines  a  separate  aggregation instance, which
                               WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

                               You can optionally nest another  statement  in-
                               side  the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the
                               scope of the rule so that it  only  counts  and
                               rate  limits  requests  that  match  the nested
                               statement. You can use this  nested  scope-down
                               statement  in conjunction with your aggregation
                               key specifications or you can  just  count  and
                               rate   limit   all   requests  that  match  the
                               scope-down statement, without additional aggre-
                               gation.  When you choose to just manage all re-
                               quests that match a scope-down  statement,  the
                               aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               For  additional  information about the options,
                               see Rate limiting web requests using rate-based
                               rules in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               If  you only aggregate on the individual IP ad-
                               dress or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve
                               the  list of IP addresses that WAF is currently
                               rate limiting for a rule through the  API  call
                               GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys  . This option
                               is not available for other aggregation configu-
                               rations.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for  a  single aggregation instance for the
                                   rate-based rule. If the  rate-based  state-
                                   ment  includes  a ScopeDownStatement , this
                                   limit is applied only to the requests  that
                                   match the statement.

                                   Examples:

                                   o If  you aggregate on just the IP address,
                                     this is the limit on  requests  from  any
                                     single IP address.

                                   o If  you  aggregate on the HTTP method and
                                     the query argument name "city", then this
                                     is  the  limit on requests for any single
                                     method, city pair.

                               EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                                   The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  WAF
                                   should include in its request counts, look-
                                   ing back from the current time.  For  exam-
                                   ple,  for a setting of 120, when WAF checks
                                   the rate, it counts the requests for the  2
                                   minutes  immediately  preceding the current
                                   time. Valid settings are 60, 120, 300,  and
                                   600.

                                   This  setting  doesn't  determine how often
                                   WAF checks the rate, but how  far  back  it
                                   looks  each  time it checks. WAF checks the
                                   rate about every 10 seconds.

                                   Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components specified in the  aggregation
                                      keys  are  omitted  from  the rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   o CONSTANT - Count and limit  the  requests
                                     that    match   the   rate-based   rule's
                                     scope-down statement. With  this  option,
                                     the  counted  requests aren't further ag-
                                     gregated. The scope-down statement is the
                                     only  specification  used. When the count
                                     of  all   requests   that   satisfy   the
                                     scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                     WAF applies the rule action  to  all  re-
                                     quests that satisfy the scope-down state-
                                     ment.  With this option, you must config-
                                     ure the ScopeDownStatement property.

                                   o CUSTOM_KEYS   -   Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts using one or more web request com-
                                     ponents  as the aggregate keys. With this
                                     option, you must  specify  the  aggregate
                                     keys  in the CustomKeys property.  To ag-
                                     gregate on only the IP  address  or  only
                                     the  forwarded IP address, don't use cus-
                                     tom keys. Instead, set the aggregate  key
                                     type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  With this option, you must spec-
                                     ify the header to use in the ForwardedIP-
                                     Config  property.  To aggregate on a com-
                                     bination of the forwarded IP address with
                                     other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web  request  origin.
                                     To  aggregate  on a combination of the IP
                                     address with other  aggregate  keys,  use
                                     CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               (   ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                               (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if you specify a forwarded
                                   IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               CustomKeys -> (list)
                                   Specifies the aggregate keys to  use  in  a
                                   rate-base rule.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single custom aggregate key
                                      for a rate-base rule.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the  components specified in the ag-
                                          gregation keys are omitted from  the

                                      Header -> (structure)
                                          Use the value of a header in the re-
                                          quest as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct value in the  header  contrib-
                                          utes to the aggregation instance. If
                                          you use a single header as your cus-
                                          tom  key,  then each value fully de-
                                          fines an aggregation instance.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the header to use.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate

                                      QueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Use the specified query argument  as
                                          an   aggregate  key.  Each  distinct
                                          value for the named  query  argument
                                          contributes  to  the aggregation in-
                                          stance. If you use  a  single  query
                                          argument  as  your  custom key, then
                                          each value fully defines an aggrega-

                                          Use the request's HTTP method as  an
                                          aggregate  key.  Each  distinct HTTP
                                          method contributes to  the  aggrega-

                                      ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                          Use the first IP address in an  HTTP
                                          header  as  an  aggregate  key. Each
                                          distinct forwarded IP  address  con-
                                          tributes   to  the  aggregation  in-

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded
                                          IP  in  the custom key settings, you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key  to  use.  You  can aggregate on
                                          only the  forwarded  IP  address  by
                                          specifying   FORWARDED_IP   in  your

                                          Use the request's originating IP ad-
                                          dress as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct  IP address contributes to the
                                          aggregation instance.

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded

                                          Use the specified label namespace as
                                          an   aggregate  key.  Each  distinct

                                          namespace as your custom  key,  then
                                          each label name fully defines an ag-

                                          This uses only labels that have been
                                          added  to  the request by rules that

                                          as  your  custom  key, then each URI
                                          path fully  defines  an  aggregation
                                          instance.

                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-

                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify a rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)

                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space specifications  and  prefix  up  to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  ALL  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match

                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys

                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                 OrStatement -> (structure)
                     A  logical  rule  statement  used  to  combine other rule
                     statements with OR  logic.  You  provide  more  than  one
                     Statement within the OrStatement .

                     Statements -> (list)
                        The  statements  to combine with OR logic. You can use
                        any statements that can be nested.

                        (structure)
                            The processing guidance for a  Rule , used by  WAF
                            to  determine  whether  a  web request matches the
                            rule.

                            For example specifications, see the examples  sec-
                            tion of  CreateWebACL .

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   o JA3Fingerprint : Match  against  the  re-
                                     quest's  JA3 fingerprint. The JA3 finger-
                                     print is a 32-character hash derived from
                                     the  TLS  Client Hello of an incoming re-
                                     quest.  This  fingerprint  serves  as   a
                                     unique  identifier  for  the client's TLS
                                     configuration. You can  use  this  choice
                                     only  with a string match ByteMatchState-
                                     ment with the PositionalConstraint set to
                                     EXACTLY .  You can obtain the JA3 finger-
                                     print for client requests  from  the  web
                                     ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the
                                     fingerprint, it includes it in the  logs.
                                     For information about the logging fields,
                                     see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide
                                     .

                                   o HeaderOrder : The list of header names to
                                     match for. WAF creates a string that con-
                                     tains  the  ordered list of header names,
                                     from the headers in the web request,  and
                                     then matches against that string.

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters A-Z and a-z, note that  the  value  is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the
                                   value. The maximum length of the value  be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For  example,  suppose the value of Type is
                                   HEADER and the value of Data is  User-Agent
                                   .  If  you  want  to  search the User-Agent
                                   header  for  the   value   BadBot   ,   you
                                   base64-encode  BadBot using MIME base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available

                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-

                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-

                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value  of  SearchString  ,  and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _).  In  addition,  SearchString  must be a
                                   word, which means that both of the  follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the
                                     specified part of the web request  or  is
                                     preceded by a character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric character or  underscore  (_).
                                     Examples  include  the  value of a header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString is at the end of the  speci-
                                     fied  part  of the web request or is fol-

                                   The value of SearchString  must  appear  at
                                   the  end  of  the specified part of the web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that  inspects  for  malicious
                               SQL  code.  Attackers insert malicious SQL code
                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  ALL  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts of the cookies to inspect
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the

                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You can obtain the JA3  fingerprint  for
                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text

                               SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                                   The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to
                                   inspect for SQL injection attacks.
                                      HIGH detects  more  attacks,  but  might
                                      generate  more  false  positives,  espe-
                                      cially if your web  requests  frequently
                                      contain unusual strings. For information
                                      about identifying and  mitigating  false

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources  that already have other protec-
                                      tions against SQL injection  attacks  or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that inspects  for  cross-site
                               scripting  (XSS)  attacks.  In XSS attacks, the
                               attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign  web-
                               site   as   a   vehicle   to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  ALL  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as
                                      they  appear in the web request that WAF
                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter  hash  derived from the TLS Client
                                      Hello of an incoming request. This  fin-
                                      gerprint  serves  as a unique identifier
                                      for the client's TLS configuration.  WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each request that has enough TLS  Client
                                      Hello  information  for the calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You can obtain the JA3  fingerprint  for
                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body,  WAF inspects only the number of bytes of
                               the body up to the limit for the  web  ACL.  By
                               default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8
                               KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront  web  ACLs,
                               this  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For Cloud-
                               Front web ACLs, you can increase the  limit  in
                               the  web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional
                               fees. If you know that  the  request  body  for
                               your  web  requests should never exceed the in-
                               spection limit, you could use a size constraint
                               statement  to block requests that have a larger
                               request body size.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional

                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-

                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  ALL  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value

                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must

                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to

                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter  hash  derived from the TLS Client
                                      Hello of an incoming request. This  fin-
                                      gerprint  serves  as a unique identifier
                                      for the client's TLS configuration.  WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each request that has enough TLS  Client
                                      Hello  information  for the calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You can obtain the JA3  fingerprint  for
                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-
                                      ration.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that labels web requests by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests  based  on  country  code. A geo match
                               rule labels every request that it inspects  re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To  manage  requests only by country, you can
                                 use this statement by itself and specify  the
                                 countries  that  you want to match against in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then, add one or more label  match  rules  to
                                 run  after  the  geo match rule and configure
                                 them to match against the  geographic  labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF  labels  requests using the alpha-2 country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF determines the codes using  either  the  IP
                               address  in  the  web request origin or, if you
                               specify it, the address in the geo  match  For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If  you  use  the web request origin, the label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If you use a forwarded IP  address,  the  label
                               formats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               rule statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array  of  two-character  country  codes
                                   that  you  want to match against, for exam-
                                   ple, [ "US", "CN"  ]  ,  from  the  alpha-2
                                   country  ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the  region and country labels that it adds
                                   to requests, you still  have  to  supply  a
                                   country  code  for the rule to evaluate. In
                                   this case, you configure the rule  to  only
                                   count  matching requests, but it will still
                                   generate logging and count metrics for  any
                                   matches.  You  can  reduce  the logging and
                                   metrics that the rule produces by  specify-
                                   ing  a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You cannot use a rule group  ref-
                               erence statement inside another rule group. You
                               can only reference a rule group as a  top-level
                               statement  within  a  rule that you define in a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead of this option, use  RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                   Action  settings to use in the place of the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule  group.  You  specify one override for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You can use overrides for testing, for  ex-
                                   ample  you can override all of rule actions
                                   to Count and  then  monitor  the  resulting
                                   count  metrics  to  understand how the rule
                                   group would handle your  web  traffic.  You
                                   can  also  permanently override some or all
                                   actions, to modify how the rule group  man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Action  setting to use in the place of a
                                      rule action that  is  configured  inside
                                      the rule group. You specify one override
                                      for each rule whose action you  want  to
                                      change.

                                      You  can  use overrides for testing, for
                                      example you can override all of rule ac-

                                      the  rule  group  would  handle your web
                                      traffic. You can also permanently  over-
                                      ride  some or all actions, to modify how
                                      the rule group manages your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the rule to override.

                                          The override action to use, in place
                                          of the configured action of the rule
                                          in the rule group.

                                          Block -> (structure)
                                             Instructs WAF to  block  the  web
                                             request.

                                             CustomResponse -> (structure)
                                                 Defines a custom response for
                                                 the web request.

                                                           avoid     confusion
                                                           with   the  headers
                                                           that are already in
                                                           the   request.  For
                                                           example,  for   the
                                                           header  name sample
                                                           , WAF  inserts  the
                                                           header
                                                           x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the
                                                           custom header.

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  ALL  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  ALL , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All does not require a  match  to
                                             be  found in the keys and a match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter  hash  derived from the TLS Client
                                      Hello of an incoming request. This  fin-
                                      gerprint  serves  as a unique identifier
                                      for the client's TLS configuration.  WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each request that has enough TLS  Client
                                      Hello  information  for the calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-

                                      You can obtain the JA3  fingerprint  for
                                      client  requests  from the web ACL logs.
                                      If WAF is able to calculate the  finger-
                                      print,  it  includes it in the logs. For
                                      information about  the  logging  fields,
                                      see  Log  fields  in  the  WAF Developer

                                      Provide the JA3 fingerprint string  from
                                      the  logs in your string match statement
                                      specification, to match with any  future
                                      requests that have the same TLS configu-

                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the

                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-

                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rate-based rule counts incoming requests and
                               rate limits requests when they  are  coming  at
                               too  fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests
                               according to your  aggregation  criteria,  col-
                               lects  them  into  aggregation  instances,  and
                               counts and rate limits the  requests  for  each
                               instance.

                               You  can  specify  individual aggregation keys,
                               like IP address or HTTP method.  You  can  also
                               specify  aggregation  key combinations, like IP
                               address and HTTP method, or HTTP method,  query
                               argument, and cookie.

                               Each  unique  set of values for the aggregation
                               keys that you specify is a separate aggregation
                               instance,  with  the  value  from each key con-
                               tributing to the aggregation  instance  defini-
                               tion.

                               For  example, assume the rule evaluates web re-
                               quests with the following IP address  and  HTTP
                               method values:

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               The rule would create different aggregation in-
                               stances according to your aggregation criteria,
                               for example:

                               o If  the  aggregation  criteria is just the IP
                                 address, then each individual address  is  an
                                 aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
                                 separately  for  each.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances  and  request  counts for our example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                 o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                               o If the aggregation criteria is  HTTP  method,
                                 then each individual HTTP method is an aggre-
                                 gation instance.  The  aggregation  instances
                                 and  request  counts for our example would be
                                 the following:

                                 o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                 o HTTP method GET: count 2

                               o If the aggregation criteria is IP address and
                                 HTTP  method,  then  each IP address and each
                                 HTTP method would contribute to the  combined
                                 aggregation  instance.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances and request counts  for  our  example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP  address  10.1.1.1,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count
                                   2

                                 o IP  address  127.0.0.0,  HTTP  method POST:
                                   count 1

                               For  any  n-tuple  of  aggregation  keys,  each
                               unique  combination  of values for the keys de-
                               fines a separate  aggregation  instance,  which
                               WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

                               You  can  optionally nest another statement in-
                               side the rate-based statement,  to  narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule so that it only counts and
                               rate limits  requests  that  match  the  nested
                               statement.  You  can use this nested scope-down
                               statement in conjunction with your  aggregation
                               key  specifications  or  you can just count and
                               rate  limit  all  requests   that   match   the
                               scope-down statement, without additional aggre-
                               gation. When you choose to just manage all  re-
                               quests  that  match a scope-down statement, the
                               aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment or OrStatement . You can  define  a  Rate-
                               BasedStatement  inside  a  web ACL and inside a
                               rule group.

                               For additional information about  the  options,
                               see Rate limiting web requests using rate-based
                               rules in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               If you only aggregate on the individual IP  ad-
                               dress or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve
                               the list of IP addresses that WAF is  currently
                               rate  limiting  for a rule through the API call
                               GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys . This  option
                               is not available for other aggregation configu-
                               rations.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single aggregation instance  for  the
                                   rate-based  rule.  If the rate-based state-
                                   ment includes a ScopeDownStatement  ,  this
                                   limit  is applied only to the requests that
                                   match the statement.

                                   Examples:

                                   o If you aggregate on just the IP  address,
                                     this  is  the  limit on requests from any
                                     single IP address.

                                   o If you aggregate on the HTTP  method  and
                                     the query argument name "city", then this
                                     is the limit on requests for  any  single
                                     method, city pair.

                               EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                                   The  amount  of  time, in seconds, that WAF
                                   should include in its request counts, look-
                                   ing  back  from the current time. For exam-
                                   ple, for a setting of 120, when WAF  checks
                                   the  rate, it counts the requests for the 2
                                   minutes immediately preceding  the  current
                                   time.  Valid settings are 60, 120, 300, and
                                   600.

                                   This setting doesn't  determine  how  often
                                   WAF  checks  the  rate, but how far back it
                                   looks each time it checks. WAF  checks  the
                                   rate about every 10 seconds.

                                   Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components  specified in the aggregation
                                      keys are  omitted  from  the  rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   o CONSTANT  -  Count and limit the requests
                                     that   match   the   rate-based    rule's
                                     scope-down  statement.  With this option,
                                     the counted requests aren't  further  ag-
                                     gregated. The scope-down statement is the
                                     only specification used. When  the  count
                                     of   all   requests   that   satisfy  the
                                     scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                     WAF  applies  the  rule action to all re-
                                     quests that satisfy the scope-down state-
                                     ment.  With this option, you must config-
                                     ure the ScopeDownStatement property.

                                   o CUSTOM_KEYS  -  Aggregate   the   request
                                     counts using one or more web request com-
                                     ponents as the aggregate keys. With  this
                                     option,  you  must  specify the aggregate
                                     keys in the CustomKeys property.  To  ag-
                                     gregate  on  only  the IP address or only
                                     the forwarded IP address, don't use  cus-
                                     tom  keys. Instead, set the aggregate key
                                     type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  With this option, you must spec-
                                     ify the header to use in the ForwardedIP-
                                     Config property.  To aggregate on a  com-
                                     bination of the forwarded IP address with
                                     other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the
                                     IP  address  from the web request origin.
                                     To aggregate on a combination of  the  IP
                                     address  with  other  aggregate keys, use
                                     CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if you specify a forwarded
                                   IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               CustomKeys -> (list)
                                   Specifies  the  aggregate  keys to use in a
                                   rate-base rule.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single custom aggregate  key
                                      for a rate-base rule.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of

                                          Use  the request's HTTP method as an
                                          aggregate key.  Each  distinct  HTTP
                                          method  contributes  to the aggrega-

                                          each method fully defines an  aggre-

                                      ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                          Use  the first IP address in an HTTP
                                          header as  an  aggregate  key.  Each
                                          distinct  forwarded  IP address con-

                                          When  you specify an IP or forwarded
                                          IP in the custom key  settings,  you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key to use.  You  can  aggregate  on
                                          only  the  forwarded  IP  address by
                                          specifying  FORWARDED_IP   in   your

                                          With this option, you  must  specify
                                          the  header to use in the rate-based

                                      IP -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's originating IP ad-
                                          dress as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct IP address contributes to  the
                                          aggregation instance.

                                          When  you specify an IP or forwarded
                                          IP in the custom key  settings,  you

                                          only the IP address by specifying IP
                                          in your rate-based  statement's  Ag-

                                          Use the specified label namespace as
                                          an  aggregate  key.  Each   distinct
                                          fully  qualified label name that has
                                          the specified label  namespace  con-

                                          stance. If you use  just  one  label
                                          namespace  as  your custom key, then
                                          each label name fully defines an ag-

                                          This uses only labels that have been
                                          added to the request by  rules  that
                                          are evaluated before this rate-based

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's URI path as an ag-

                                          contributes to the  aggregation  in-
                                          stance. If you use just the URI path
                                          as your custom key,  then  each  URI
                                          path  fully  defines  an aggregation

                                             used in rule match statements, to

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule  statements  with  AND  logic. You provide
                               more than one  Statement within  the  AndState-

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to combine with AND logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to  combine with OR logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a managed rule group. To  use  this,
                               provide  the  vendor  name  and the name of the
                               rule group in this statement. You can  retrieve
                               the  required names by calling  ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You cannot  use  a  managed  rule
                               group  inside  another rule group. You can only
                               reference a managed rule group as  a  top-level
                               statement  within  a  rule that you define in a
                               web ACL.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify a rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)

                                             sponses to login  requests,  used
                                             by  the  ATP  rule group to track
                                             login failure rates.

                                                 able  only  in  web ACLs that
                                                 protect   Amazon   CloudFront

                                             The  ATP rule group evaluates the

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement to match against  labels  that
                               have  been  added  to  the web request by rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space  specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the

                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                             keys or the values  or  both.  To
                                             require  a  match in the keys and
                                             in the values, use a logical  AND
                                             statement  to  combine  two match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.
                                             All  does  not require a match to
                                             be found in the keys and a  match
                                             to be found in the values. It re-
                                             quires a match to be found in the
                                             keys  or  the  values or both. To
                                             require a match in the  keys  and
                                             in  the values, use a logical AND
                                             statement to  combine  two  match
                                             rules, one that inspects the keys
                                             and  another  that  inspects  the
                                             values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print. The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-char-
                                      acter hash derived from the  TLS  Client
                                      Hello  of an incoming request. This fin-
                                      gerprint serves as a  unique  identifier
                                      for  the client's TLS configuration. WAF
                                      calculates and logs this fingerprint for
                                      each  request that has enough TLS Client
                                      Hello information for  the  calculation.
                                      Almost all web requests include this in-
                                      formation.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      You  can  obtain the JA3 fingerprint for
                                      client requests from the web  ACL  logs.
                                      If  WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                      print, it includes it in the  logs.  For
                                      information  about  the  logging fields,
                                      see Log  fields  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                      Guide .

                                      Provide  the JA3 fingerprint string from
                                      the logs in your string match  statement
                                      specification,  to match with any future

                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                 NotStatement -> (structure)
                     A logical rule statement used to negate  the  results  of
                     another rule statement. You provide one  Statement within
                     the NotStatement .

                     Statement -> (structure)
                        The statement to negate. You  can  use  any  statement
                        that can be nested.

                        ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  that  defines  a  string match
                            search for WAF to apply to web requests. The  byte
                            match  statement provides the bytes to search for,
                            the location in requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                            search,  and  other  settings. The bytes to search
                            for are typically a string that  corresponds  with
                            ASCII  characters.  In the WAF console and the de-
                            veloper guide,  this  is  called  a  string  match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF searches only in the part of  web  requests
                               that  you  designate  for inspection in  Field-
                               ToMatch . The maximum length of  the  value  is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid  values  depend on the component that you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath : The value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               o JA3Fingerprint : Match against the  request's
                                 JA3  fingerprint.  The  JA3  fingerprint is a
                                 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client
                                 Hello  of  an  incoming request. This finger-
                                 print serves as a unique identifier  for  the
                                 client's  TLS configuration. You can use this
                                 choice only with a  string  match  ByteMatch-
                                 Statement  with  the PositionalConstraint set
                                 to EXACTLY .  You can obtain the JA3  finger-
                                 print  for  client  requests from the web ACL
                                 logs. If WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                 print, it includes it in the logs. For infor-
                                 mation about  the  logging  fields,  see  Log
                                 fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               o HeaderOrder  :  The  list  of header names to
                                 match for. WAF creates a string that contains
                                 the  ordered  list  of header names, from the
                                 headers in the web request, and then  matches
                                 against that string.

                               If  SearchString includes alphabetic characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value.
                               The maximum length  of  the  value  before  you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For  example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you  want  to  search the User-Agent header for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing  MIME  base64-encoding  and include the re-
                               sulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value  of
                               SearchString .
                                   If  you're using the CLI or one of the Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The value that you want WAF to search for.  The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The area within the portion of the web  request
                               that  you want WAF to search for SearchString .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The specified part of the web request must  in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The specified part of the web request must  in-
                               clude  the  value of SearchString , and Search-
                               String must contain only  alphanumeric  charac-
                               ters  or  underscore  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In
                               addition, SearchString must be  a  word,  which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified part of the web request or is  preceded
                                 by  a  character  other  than an alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString  is  at the end of the specified
                                 part of the web request or is followed  by  a
                                 character  other than an alphanumeric charac-
                                 ter or underscore (_), for  example,  BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The  value of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest must exactly match the value  of  Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the
                               beginning of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that inspects for  malicious  SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate more  false  positives,  especially  if
                                   your  web  requests  frequently contain un-
                                   usual strings. For information about  iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see
                                   Testing and tuning  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   LOW  is  generally  a better choice for re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against  SQL injection attacks or that have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  inspects  for  cross-site
                            scripting  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a  vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-

                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that compares a number of bytes
                            against the size of a request component,  using  a
                            comparison  operator,  such as greater than (>) or
                            less than (<). For example, you  can  use  a  size
                            constraint  statement  to  look  for query strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If you configure WAF to inspect the request  body,
                            WAF  inspects only the number of bytes of the body
                            up to the limit for the web ACL. By  default,  for
                            regional  web  ACLs,  this  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                            bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs, this limit  is
                            16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront web ACLs, you
                            can increase the limit in the web ACL Association-
                            Config , for additional fees. If you know that the
                            request body for your web  requests  should  never
                            exceed  the inspection limit, you could use a size
                            constraint statement to block requests that have a
                            larger request body size.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest to filter on,  the  slash  (/)  in  the  URI
                            counts  as  one  character.  For  example, the URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the JsonBody  ob-
                                   ject configuration.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try and region and that matches  against  web  re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels every request that it inspects regardless  of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To  manage requests only by country, you can use
                              this statement by itself and specify  the  coun-
                              tries  that  you  want  to  match against in the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise, configure your geo  match  rule  with
                              Count  action  so  that it only labels requests.
                              Then, add one or more label match rules  to  run
                              after  the  geo match rule and configure them to
                              match against the geographic labels  and  handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and
                            region codes from the  International  Organization
                            for  Standardization  (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF de-
                            termines the codes using either the IP address  in
                            the  web request origin or, if you specify it, the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If you use the web request origin, the label  for-
                            mats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country
                            code>-<ISO   region   code>   and    awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label for-
                            mats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO  coun-
                            try   code>-<ISO   region  code>  and  awswaf:for-

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An  array  of  two-character country codes that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN"  ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region  and  country labels that it adds to re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for  the  rule  to  evaluate. In this case, you
                               configure the rule to only count  matching  re-
                               quests,  but it will still generate logging and
                               count metrics for any matches. You  can  reduce
                               the  logging and metrics that the rule produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a
                            rule  group  with your rules, then provide the ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,
                            for  example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement or
                            OrStatement . You cannot use a rule  group  refer-
                            ence  statement inside another rule group. You can
                            only reference a rule group as a top-level  state-
                            ment within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions that are  configured  inside  the  rule
                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                               (structure)
                                   Action setting to use in  the  place  of  a
                                   rule  action  that is configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule to override.

                                      The override action to use, in place  of
                                      the configured action of the rule in the
                                      rule group.

                                      Block -> (structure)
                                          Instructs WAF to block the  web  re-
                                          quest.

                                          CustomResponse -> (structure)
                                             Defines a custom response for the

                                                 to the  web  request  client.
                                                 You  can  define a custom re-

                                                 is set to block. To do  this,
                                                 you first define the response
                                                 body key  and  value  in  the

                                                 Then, in the rule  action  or
                                                 web ACL default action Block-

                                                    Value -> (string)
                                                        The  value of the cus-

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to detect web requests  com-
                            ing   from  particular  IP  addresses  or  address
                            ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that  speci-
                            fies  the  addresses  you want to detect, then use
                            the ARN of that set in this statement.  To  create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set.
                            You create and maintain  the  set  independent  of
                            your  rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the  referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the   IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The  position  in  the header to search for
                                   the IP address. The header can  contain  IP
                                   addresses  of  the original client and also
                                   of proxies. For example, the  header  value
                                   could  be  10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10
                                   where the first IP address  identifies  the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The options for this setting are  the  fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in
                                     the list of IP addresses in  the  header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY - Inspect all  IP  addresses  in  the
                                     header  for  a  match. If the header con-
                                     tains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF  in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions that you want to detect, then use  the
                            ARN  of  that set in this statement. A web request
                            matches the pattern set rule statement if the  re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set. To create a  regex  pattern  set,  see   Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent  of your rules. This allows you to use
                            the single set in multiple rules. When you  update
                            the  referenced set, WAF automatically updates all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-
                                          mentation JavaScript Object Notation
                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two

                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A rate-based rule  counts  incoming  requests  and
                            rate  limits  requests when they are coming at too
                            fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests accord-
                            ing  to  your  aggregation criteria, collects them
                            into aggregation instances, and  counts  and  rate
                            limits the requests for each instance.

                            You  can specify individual aggregation keys, like
                            IP address or HTTP method. You  can  also  specify
                            aggregation  key combinations, like IP address and
                            HTTP method, or HTTP method, query  argument,  and
                            cookie.

                            Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys
                            that you specify is  a  separate  aggregation  in-
                            stance,  with the value from each key contributing
                            to the aggregation instance definition.

                            For example, assume the  rule  evaluates  web  re-
                            quests  with  the  following  IP  address and HTTP
                            method values:

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            The rule would create  different  aggregation  in-
                            stances  according  to  your aggregation criteria,
                            for example:

                            o If the aggregation criteria is just the  IP  ad-
                              dress, then each individual address is an aggre-
                              gation instance, and WAF counts  requests  sepa-
                              rately  for  each. The aggregation instances and
                              request counts for our example would be the fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                              o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                            o If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then
                              each individual HTTP method  is  an  aggregation
                              instance.  The aggregation instances and request
                              counts for our example would be the following:

                              o HTTP method POST: count 2

                              o HTTP method GET: count 2

                            o If the aggregation criteria is  IP  address  and
                              HTTP  method, then each IP address and each HTTP
                              method would contribute to the combined aggrega-
                              tion instance. The aggregation instances and re-
                              quest counts for our example would be  the  fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

                              o IP  address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count
                                1

                            For any n-tuple of aggregation keys,  each  unique
                            combination of values for the keys defines a sepa-
                            rate aggregation instance, which  WAF  counts  and
                            rate-limits individually.

                            You  can  optionally nest another statement inside
                            the rate-based statement, to narrow the  scope  of
                            the  rule  so  that it only counts and rate limits
                            requests that match the nested statement. You  can
                            use  this  nested scope-down statement in conjunc-
                            tion with your aggregation key  specifications  or
                            you  can  just  count  and rate limit all requests
                            that match the scope-down statement, without addi-
                            tional aggregation. When you choose to just manage
                            all requests that match  a  scope-down  statement,
                            the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                            You  cannot  nest  a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or  OrStatement . You can define a RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            For additional information about the options,  see
                            Rate  limiting web requests using rate-based rules
                            in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            If you only aggregate on the individual IP address
                            or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list
                            of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate  limit-
                            ing  for a rule through the API call GetRateBased-
                            StatementManagedKeys . This option is  not  avail-
                            able for other aggregation configurations.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each instance of a rate-based rule that  you  use.
                            For  example,  if  you provide the same rate-based
                            rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of  the  two
                            rule  statements represents a separate instance of
                            the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking  and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside a rule group, and then use that rule  group
                            in  multiple  places,  each use creates a separate
                            instance of the rate-based rule that gets its  own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single aggregation instance for the  rate-based
                               rule.  If  the  rate-based statement includes a
                               ScopeDownStatement , this limit is applied only
                               to the requests that match the statement.

                               Examples:

                               o If you aggregate on just the IP address, this
                                 is the limit on requests from any  single  IP
                                 address.

                               o If  you  aggregate on the HTTP method and the
                                 query argument name "city", then this is  the
                                 limit on requests for any single method, city
                                 pair.

                            EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should
                               include  in  its  request  counts, looking back
                               from the current time. For example, for a  set-
                               ting  of  120,  when  WAF  checks  the rate, it
                               counts the requests for the 2  minutes  immedi-
                               ately  preceding  the  current time. Valid set-
                               tings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

                               This setting doesn't determine  how  often  WAF
                               checks the rate, but how far back it looks each
                               time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every
                               10 seconds.

                               Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts.

                               NOTE:
                                   Web requests that are missing  any  of  the
                                   components  specified  in  the  aggregation
                                   keys are omitted from the  rate-based  rule
                                   evaluation and handling.

                               o CONSTANT  - Count and limit the requests that
                                 match the rate-based rule's scope-down state-
                                 ment.  With this option, the counted requests
                                 aren't  further  aggregated.  The  scope-down
                                 statement  is  the  only  specification used.
                                 When the count of all requests  that  satisfy
                                 the scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                 WAF applies the rule action to  all  requests
                                 that  satisfy the scope-down statement.  With
                                 this option, you must  configure  the  Scope-
                                 DownStatement property.

                               o CUSTOM_KEYS  -  Aggregate  the request counts
                                 using one or more web request  components  as
                                 the  aggregate  keys.  With  this option, you
                                 must specify the aggregate keys in  the  Cus-
                                 tomKeys  property.   To aggregate on only the
                                 IP address or only the forwarded IP  address,
                                 don't  use  custom keys. Instead, set the ag-
                                 gregate key type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                               o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate the  request  counts
                                 on  the  first  IP address in an HTTP header.
                                 With this option, you must specify the header
                                 to use in the ForwardedIPConfig property.  To
                                 aggregate on a combination of  the  forwarded
                                 IP  address  with  other  aggregate keys, use
                                 CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the  IP
                                 address  from  the web request origin. To ag-
                                 gregate on a combination of  the  IP  address
                                 with other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                            (  ... recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig -> (struc-
                            ture)
                               The configuration for inspecting  IP  addresses
                               in  an HTTP header that you specify, instead of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request  origin.  Commonly,  this is the X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header, but  you  can  specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This  is required if you specify a forwarded IP
                               in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            CustomKeys -> (list)
                               Specifies  the  aggregate  keys  to  use  in  a
                               rate-base rule.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single custom aggregate key for
                                   a rate-base rule.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components specified in the  aggregation
                                      keys  are  omitted  from  the rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   Header -> (structure)
                                      Use the value of a header in the request
                                      as an aggregate key. Each distinct value
                                      in the header contributes to the  aggre-
                                      gation  instance.  If  you  use a single
                                      header as your  custom  key,  then  each
                                      value  fully  defines an aggregation in-
                                      stance.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the header to use.

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass  detection.  Text
                                          transformations  are  used  in  rule
                                          match  statements,  to transform the
                                          FieldToMatch request  component  be-
                                          fore inspecting it, and they're used
                                          in rate-based  rule  statements,  to
                                          transform  request components before
                                          using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                          keys.  If  you  specify  one or more
                                          transformations to apply,  WAF  per-
                                          forms  all  transformations  on  the
                                          specified content, starting from the
                                          lowest  priority  setting,  and then
                                          uses the transformed component  con-
                                          tents.

                                          (structure)
                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting
                                             that  attackers  use  in  web re-
                                             quests in an effort to bypass de-
                                             tection.

                                             Priority -> (integer)
                                                 Sets  the relative processing
                                                 order for multiple  transfor-
                                                 mations.  WAF  processes  all

                                   HTTPMethod -> (structure)
                                      Use the request's HTTP method as an  ag-
                                      gregate  key.  Each distinct HTTP method
                                      contributes to the aggregation instance.
                                      If  you use just the HTTP method as your
                                      custom key, then each method  fully  de-
                                      fines an aggregation instance.

                                   ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  first  IP  address  in an HTTP
                                      header as an aggregate  key.  Each  dis-
                                      tinct  forwarded  IP address contributes
                                      to the aggregation instance.

                                      When you specify an IP or  forwarded  IP
                                      in  the  custom  key  settings, you must
                                      also specify at least one other  key  to
                                      use.  You can aggregate on only the for-
                                      warded IP  address  by  specifying  FOR-
                                      WARDED_IP in your rate-based statement's
                                      AggregateKeyType .

                                      With this option, you must  specify  the
                                      header  to  use in the rate-based rule's
                                      ForwardedIPConfig property.

                                   IP -> (structure)
                                      Use the request's originating IP address
                                      as  an  aggregate  key. Each distinct IP
                                      address contributes to  the  aggregation
                                      instance.

                                      When  you  specify an IP or forwarded IP
                                      in the custom  key  settings,  you  must
                                      also  specify  at least one other key to
                                      use. You can aggregate on  only  the  IP
                                      address   by   specifying   IP  in  your
                                      rate-based statement's  AggregateKeyType
                                      .

                                   LabelNamespace -> (structure)
                                      Use  the specified label namespace as an
                                      aggregate key. Each distinct fully qual-
                                      ified  label name that has the specified
                                      label namespace contributes to  the  ag-
                                      gregation  instance. If you use just one
                                      label namespace as your custom key, then
                                      each  label name fully defines an aggre-
                                      gation instance.

                                      This uses only  labels  that  have  been
                                      added  to  the request by rules that are
                                      evaluated before this rate-based rule in
                                      the web ACL.

                                      For  information  about label namespaces

                                      Namespace -> (string)
                                          The namespace to  use  for  aggrega-
                                          tion.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Use  the request's URI path as an aggre-
                                      gate key. Each distinct  URI  path  con-
                                      tributes to the aggregation instance. If
                                      you use just the URI path as your custom
                                      key, then each URI path fully defines an
                                      aggregation instance.

                                      TextTransformations -> (list)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort  to  bypass  detection.  Text
                                          transformations  are  used  in  rule
                                          match  statements,  to transform the
                                          FieldToMatch request  component  be-
                                          fore inspecting it, and they're used
                                          in rate-based  rule  statements,  to
                                          transform  request components before
                                          using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                          keys.  If  you  specify  one or more
                                          transformations to apply,  WAF  per-
                                          forms  all  transformations  on  the
                                          specified content, starting from the
                                          lowest  priority  setting,  and then
                                          uses the transformed component  con-

                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide  the  vendor  name  and  the name of the rule
                            group in this statement. You can retrieve the  re-

                               The  name of the managed rule group vendor. You
                               use this, along with the rule  group  name,  to
                               identify a rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use
                               this, along with the vendor name,  to  identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version  of the managed rule group to use.
                               If you specify this,  the  version  setting  is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this, WAF uses the  vendor's  default  version,
                               and  then keeps the version at the vendor's de-
                               fault when the vendor updates the managed  rule
                               group settings.

                               mitigation require additional configuration:

                               o Use the AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet configura-
                                 tion object to configure the account creation

                                 tion includes the sign-in page of your appli-
                                 cation and the locations in the login request
                                 payload  of  data  such  as  the username and
                                 password.

                               o Use the AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet con-
                                 figuration object to configure the protection
                                 level that you  want  the  Bot  Control  rule
                                 group to use.

                               (structure)

                                   managed  rule  group.  Many  managed   rule
                                   groups don't require this.

                                   The rule groups used for intelligent threat
                                   mitigation  require  additional  configura-

                                     page  of  your  application and the loca-
                                     tions in the  login  request  payload  of
                                     data such as the username and password.

                                   o Use  the AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet
                                     configuration  object  to  configure  the
                                     protection  level  that  you want the Bot
                                     Control rule group to use.

                                      LoginPath -> (string)
                                          The  path  of the login endpoint for
                                          your application. For  example,  for
                                          the  URL https://example.com/web/lo-
                                          gin , you  would  provide  the  path
                                          /web/login  . Login paths that start
                                          with the path that you  provide  are
                                          considered   a  match.  For  example
                                          /web/login matches the  login  paths
                                          /web/login     ,    /web/login/    ,

                                          that  have had too many failed login

                                          provide  are considered a match. For
                                          example  /web/registration   matches

                                             How you specify this  depends  on
                                             the  request  inspection  payload
                                             type.

                                                 How  you specify this depends
                                                 on  the  request   inspection
                                                 payload type.

                                                 o For  JSON payloads, specify

                                                        For  example,  for the

                                                    Value -> (string)
                                                        The value of the  cus-

                        LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement to match against labels that have
                            been added to the web request by rules  that  have
                            already run in the web ACL.

                            The  label  match  statement provides the label or
                            namespace string to search for. The  label  string
                            can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully  qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                            namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added the label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                            qualified  name  in  your  label match string, WAF
                            performs the search for labels that were added  in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-
                               bel name or just the namespace.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The string to match against.  The  setting  you
                               provide  for  this  depends on the match state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If the Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,  then  this
                                 specification  must  include the name and can
                                 include any  number  of  preceding  namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then  this
                                 specification  can include any number of con-
                                 tiguous namespace strings,  and  can  include
                                 the  entire  label  namespace prefix from the
                                 rule group or web ACL where the label  origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels  are  case sensitive and components of a
                               label must be separated by colon,  for  example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                        RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-

                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support

                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the

                 ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to run the rules that  are  defined
                     in  a managed rule group. To use this, provide the vendor
                     name and the name of the rule group  in  this  statement.
                     You  can  retrieve  the  required  names by calling  Lis-
                     tAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                     You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for example
                     for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement . You cannot
                     use a managed rule group inside another rule  group.  You
                     can  only  reference  a managed rule group as a top-level
                     statement within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                     NOTE:
                        You are charged additional fees when you use  the  WAF

                        Pricing .

                     VendorName -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  managed rule group vendor. You use
                        this, along with the rule group name,  to  identify  a
                        rule group.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  managed  rule group. You use this,
                        along with the  vendor  name,  to  identify  the  rule
                        group.

                     Version -> (string)
                        The  version  of the managed rule group to use. If you
                        specify this, the version setting is fixed  until  you
                        change  it.  If  you  don't specify this, WAF uses the
                        vendor's default version, and then keeps  the  version
                        at  the  vendor's  default when the vendor updates the
                        managed rule group settings.

                     ExcludedRules -> (list)
                        Rules in the referenced rule group whose  actions  are
                        set to Count .

                        NOTE:
                            Instead  of this option, use RuleActionOverrides .
                            It accepts any  valid  action  setting,  including
                            Count .

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a single rule in a rule group whose ac-
                            tion you want to override to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               .  It accepts any valid action setting, includ-
                               ing Count .

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the rule whose action you  want  to
                               override to Count .

                     ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                        An optional nested statement that narrows the scope of
                        the web requests that are  evaluated  by  the  managed
                        rule  group.  Requests  are only evaluated by the rule
                        group if they match the scope-down statement. You  can
                        use  any  nestable  Statement in the scope-down state-
                        ment, and you can nest statements at  any  level,  the
                        same as you can for a rule statement.

                        ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  that  defines  a  string match
                            search for WAF to apply to web requests. The  byte
                            match  statement provides the bytes to search for,
                            the location in requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                            search,  and  other  settings. The bytes to search
                            for are typically a string that  corresponds  with
                            ASCII  characters.  In the WAF console and the de-
                            veloper guide,  this  is  called  a  string  match
                            statement.

                            SearchString -> (blob)
                               A string value that you want WAF to search for.
                               WAF searches only in the part of  web  requests
                               that  you  designate  for inspection in  Field-
                               ToMatch . The maximum length of  the  value  is
                               200 bytes.

                               Valid  values  depend on the component that you
                               specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                               o Method : The HTTP method that you want WAF to
                                 search for. This indicates the type of opera-
                                 tion specified in the request.

                               o UriPath : The value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                 search for in the URI path, for example, /im-
                                 ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                               o JA3Fingerprint : Match against the  request's
                                 JA3  fingerprint.  The  JA3  fingerprint is a
                                 32-character hash derived from the TLS Client
                                 Hello  of  an  incoming request. This finger-
                                 print serves as a unique identifier  for  the
                                 client's  TLS configuration. You can use this
                                 choice only with a  string  match  ByteMatch-
                                 Statement  with  the PositionalConstraint set
                                 to EXACTLY .  You can obtain the JA3  finger-
                                 print  for  client  requests from the web ACL
                                 logs. If WAF is able to calculate the finger-
                                 print, it includes it in the logs. For infor-
                                 mation about  the  logging  fields,  see  Log
                                 fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               o HeaderOrder  :  The  list  of header names to
                                 match for. WAF creates a string that contains
                                 the  ordered  list  of header names, from the
                                 headers in the web request, and then  matches
                                 against that string.

                               If  SearchString includes alphabetic characters
                               A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensi-
                               tive.
                                   If you're using the WAF API

                               Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value.
                               The maximum length  of  the  value  before  you
                               base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                               For  example,  suppose  the  value  of  Type is
                               HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If
                               you  want  to  search the User-Agent header for
                               the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot us-
                               ing  MIME  base64-encoding  and include the re-
                               sulting value,  QmFkQm90  ,  in  the  value  of
                               SearchString .
                                   If  you're using the CLI or one of the Ama-
                                   zon Web Services SDKs

                               The value that you want WAF to search for.  The
                               SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,

                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the

                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                               The area within the portion of the web  request
                               that  you want WAF to search for SearchString .
                               Valid values include the following:
                                   CONTAINS

                               The specified part of the web request must  in-
                               clude the value of SearchString , but the loca-
                               tion doesn't matter.
                                   CONTAINS_WORD

                               The specified part of the web request must  in-
                               clude  the  value of SearchString , and Search-
                               String must contain only  alphanumeric  charac-
                               ters  or  underscore  (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In
                               addition, SearchString must be  a  word,  which
                               means that both of the following are true:

                               o SearchString is at the beginning of the spec-
                                 ified part of the web request or is  preceded
                                 by  a  character  other  than an alphanumeric
                                 character or underscore (_). Examples include
                                 the value of a header and ;BadBot .

                               o SearchString  is  at the end of the specified
                                 part of the web request or is followed  by  a
                                 character  other than an alphanumeric charac-
                                 ter or underscore (_), for  example,  BadBot;
                                 and -BadBot; .
                                   EXACTLY

                               The  value of the specified part of the web re-
                               quest must exactly match the value  of  Search-
                               String .
                                   STARTS_WITH

                               The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the
                               beginning of the specified part of the web  re-
                               quest.
                                   ENDS_WITH

                               The  value  of  SearchString must appear at the
                               end of the specified part of the web request.

                        SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that inspects for  malicious  SQL
                            code. Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web
                            requests to do things like modify your database or
                            extract data from it.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-
                                          mentation JavaScript Object Notation
                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:

                                      o Extra                          colons:

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                               The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to in-
                               spect for SQL injection attacks.
                                   HIGH detects more attacks, but might gener-
                                   ate more  false  positives,  especially  if
                                   your  web  requests  frequently contain un-
                                   usual strings. For information about  iden-
                                   tifying and mitigating false positives, see
                                   Testing and tuning  in  the  WAF  Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   LOW  is  generally  a better choice for re-
                                   sources that already have other protections
                                   against  SQL injection attacks or that have
                                   a low tolerance for false positives.

                               Default: LOW

                        XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule  statement  that  inspects  for  cross-site
                            scripting  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the at-
                            tacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign website as
                            a  vehicle to inject malicious client-site scripts
                            into other legitimate web browsers.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit

                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet
                                          Engineering Task Force (IETF)  docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement that compares a number of bytes
                            against the size of a request component,  using  a
                            comparison  operator,  such as greater than (>) or
                            less than (<). For example, you  can  use  a  size
                            constraint  statement  to  look  for query strings
                            that are longer than 100 bytes.

                            If you configure WAF to inspect the request  body,
                            WAF  inspects only the number of bytes of the body
                            up to the limit for the web ACL. By  default,  for
                            regional  web  ACLs,  this  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                            bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs, this limit  is
                            16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront web ACLs, you
                            can increase the limit in the web ACL Association-
                            Config , for additional fees. If you know that the
                            request body for your web  requests  should  never
                            exceed  the inspection limit, you could use a size
                            constraint statement to block requests that have a
                            larger request body size.

                            If you choose URI for the value of Part of the re-
                            quest to filter on,  the  slash  (/)  in  the  URI
                            counts  as  one  character.  For  example, the URI
                            /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The part of the web request that you  want  WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name
                                   of the  header  to  inspect,  for  example,
                                   User-Agent  or Referer . This setting isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide
                                   the name of the query argument to  inspect,
                                   such  as UserName or SalesRegion . The name
                                   can be up to 30 characters long  and  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the
                                   part of the web request that  identifies  a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the query string. This is the  part
                                   of  a URL that appears after a ? character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request  body  immediately  follows the re-
                                   quest headers. This is the part  of  a  re-
                                   quest  that  contains  any  additional data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the  HTTP request body, such as data from a
                                   form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request  bodies, see the Body object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indi-
                                   cates  the  type  of operation that the re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  re-
                                   quest  body immediately follows the request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains  any additional data that you want
                                   to send to your web server as the HTTP  re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                      The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON
                                      body. WAF inspects the results of  these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match all of the elements. See  also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the  IncludedPaths  setting,  but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer syntax.  For  example,  "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about  this syntax, see the Internet

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't  use this option to include
                                             all paths. Instead, use  the  All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the JSON to match against
                                      using the MatchPattern . If you  specify
                                      ALL  , WAF matches against keys and val-
                                      ues.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What  WAF  should do if it fails to com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body
                                        as plain text. WAF  applies  the  text
                                        transformations  and inspection crite-
                                        ria that you defined for the JSON  in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If you don't provide this  setting,  WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF  does  its  best to parse the entire
                                      JSON body, but might be forced  to  stop
                                      for  reasons such as invalid characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent  whose root node isn't an object or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not sup-
                                      port inspecting the entire  contents  of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the limit for the resource type. If  the
                                      body  is  larger than the limit, the un-
                                      derlying host service only forwards  the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The default limit is 8 KB (8,192  bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig  ,  for additional processing
                                      fees.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available body
                                        contents normally,  according  to  the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You can combine the  MATCH  or  NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule and web  ACL  action  settings,  so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request headers. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers  to  and  the  parts of the headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  headers  and  only  the  first 200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content  in the Headers object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedHeaders  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the headers whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The  parts  of the headers to match with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request cookies. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies and the parts of the  cookies  that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's cookies  and  only  the  first  200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content in the Cookies object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedCookies , or Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies":  [  "session-id-time", "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest cookies  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total cookies. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 cookies and at most 8 KB of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear in the web request that  WAF  receives
                                   for  inspection.  WAF  generates the string
                                   and then uses that as the  field  to  match
                                   component  in its inspection. WAF separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and    no   added   spaces,   for   example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  headers  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  headers.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 headers and at most 8  KB  of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match  against  the  request's  JA3 finger-
                                   print. The JA3 fingerprint is a  32-charac-
                                   ter  hash derived from the TLS Client Hello
                                   of an incoming  request.  This  fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's TLS configuration. WAF  calculates
                                   and  logs this fingerprint for each request
                                   that has enough TLS Client  Hello  informa-
                                   tion  for  the  calculation. Almost all web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You can use  this  choice  only  with  a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint  for
                                   client  requests  from the web ACL logs. If
                                   WAF is able to calculate  the  fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs in your string match statement  speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                               The operator to use to compare the request part
                               to the size setting.

                            Size -> (long)
                               The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the request
                               part, after any transformations.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass  detection.  Text
                               transformations  are  used in rule match state-
                               ments, to transform  the  FieldToMatch  request
                               component  before  inspecting  it,  and they're
                               used in rate-based rule statements,  to  trans-
                               form  request  components  before using them as
                               custom aggregation keys. If you specify one  or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations  on  the   specified   content,
                               starting  from the lowest priority setting, and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets  the  relative processing order for
                                      multiple transformations. WAF  processes
                                      all  transformations, from lowest prior-
                                      ity to highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                      transformed   content.   The  priorities
                                      don't need to be consecutive,  but  they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-
                                      mations in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement that labels web requests by coun-
                            try and region and that matches  against  web  re-
                            quests based on country code. A geo match rule la-
                            bels every request that it inspects regardless  of
                            whether it finds a match.

                            o To  manage requests only by country, you can use
                              this statement by itself and specify  the  coun-
                              tries  that  you  want  to  match against in the
                              CountryCodes array.

                            o Otherwise, configure your geo  match  rule  with
                              Count  action  so  that it only labels requests.
                              Then, add one or more label match rules  to  run
                              after  the  geo match rule and configure them to
                              match against the geographic labels  and  handle
                              the requests as needed.

                            WAF  labels requests using the alpha-2 country and
                            region codes from the  International  Organization
                            for  Standardization  (ISO) 3166 standard. WAF de-
                            termines the codes using either the IP address  in
                            the  web request origin or, if you specify it, the
                            address in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                            If you use the web request origin, the label  for-
                            mats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country
                            code>-<ISO   region   code>   and    awswaf:clien-
                            tip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            If  you use a forwarded IP address, the label for-
                            mats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO  coun-
                            try   code>-<ISO   region  code>  and  awswaf:for-
                            wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                            For additional details, see Geographic match  rule
                            statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            CountryCodes -> (list)
                               An  array  of  two-character country codes that
                               you want to match against, for example, [ "US",
                               "CN"  ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes of
                               the ISO 3166 international standard.

                               When you use a geo match statement just for the
                               region  and  country labels that it adds to re-
                               quests, you still have to supply a country code
                               for  the  rule  to  evaluate. In this case, you
                               configure the rule to only count  matching  re-
                               quests,  but it will still generate logging and
                               count metrics for any matches. You  can  reduce
                               the  logging and metrics that the rule produces
                               by specifying a country that's unlikely to be a
                               source of traffic to your site.

                               (string)

                            ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a
                            rule  group  with your rules, then provide the ARN
                            of the rule group in this statement.

                            You cannot nest  a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,
                            for  example  for  use  inside  a  NotStatement or
                            OrStatement . You cannot use a rule  group  refer-
                            ence  statement inside another rule group. You can
                            only reference a rule group as a top-level  state-
                            ment within a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)
                               Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose ac-
                               tions are set to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides  .  It  accepts any valid action set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule  group
                                   whose  action you want to override to Count
                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the rule  whose  action  you
                                      want to override to Count .

                            RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                               Action settings to use in the place of the rule
                               actions that are  configured  inside  the  rule
                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                               (structure)
                                   Action setting to use in  the  place  of  a
                                   rule  action  that is configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-

                        IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to detect web requests  com-
                            ing   from  particular  IP  addresses  or  address
                            ranges. To use this, create an  IPSet that  speci-
                            fies  the  addresses  you want to detect, then use
                            the ARN of that set in this statement.  To  create
                            an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                            Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set.
                            You create and maintain  the  set  independent  of
                            your  rules. This allows you to use the single set
                            in multiple rules. When you update the  referenced
                            set, WAF automatically updates all rules that ref-
                            erence it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the   IPSet
                               that this statement references.

                            IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                               The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses
                               in an HTTP header that you specify, instead  of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request origin. Commonly, this  is  the  X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but you can specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request doesn't have  a  valid
                                   IP address in the specified position.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                               Position -> (string)
                                   The  position  in  the header to search for
                                   the IP address. The header can  contain  IP
                                   addresses  of  the original client and also
                                   of proxies. For example, the  header  value
                                   could  be  10.1.1.1, 127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10
                                   where the first IP address  identifies  the
                                   original client and the rest identify prox-
                                   ies that the request went through.

                                   The options for this setting are  the  fol-
                                   lowing:

                                   o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in
                                     the list of IP addresses in  the  header.
                                     This is usually the client's original IP.

                                   o LAST - Inspect the last IP address in the
                                     list of IP addresses in the header.

                                   o ANY - Inspect all  IP  addresses  in  the
                                     header  for  a  match. If the header con-
                                     tains more than 10 IP addresses, WAF  in-
                                     spects the last 10.

                        RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for matches with regular expressions. To use
                            this, create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies the
                            expressions that you want to detect, then use  the
                            ARN  of  that set in this statement. A web request
                            matches the pattern set rule statement if the  re-
                            quest component matches any of the patterns in the
                            set. To create a  regex  pattern  set,  see   Cre-
                            ateRegexPatternSet .

                            Each regex pattern set rule statement references a
                            regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set
                            independent  of your rules. This allows you to use
                            the single set in multiple rules. When you  update
                            the  referenced set, WAF automatically updates all
                            rules that reference it.

                            ARN -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   Regex-
                               PatternSet that this statement references.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is

                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-
                                      edCookies": [  "session-id-time",  "ses-
                                      sion-id" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-

                        RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                            A rate-based rule  counts  incoming  requests  and
                            rate  limits  requests when they are coming at too
                            fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests accord-
                            ing  to  your  aggregation criteria, collects them
                            into aggregation instances, and  counts  and  rate
                            limits the requests for each instance.

                            You  can specify individual aggregation keys, like
                            IP address or HTTP method. You  can  also  specify
                            aggregation  key combinations, like IP address and
                            HTTP method, or HTTP method, query  argument,  and
                            cookie.

                            Each unique set of values for the aggregation keys
                            that you specify is  a  separate  aggregation  in-
                            stance,  with the value from each key contributing
                            to the aggregation instance definition.

                            For example, assume the  rule  evaluates  web  re-
                            quests  with  the  following  IP  address and HTTP
                            method values:

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                            o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                            The rule would create  different  aggregation  in-
                            stances  according  to  your aggregation criteria,
                            for example:

                            o If the aggregation criteria is just the  IP  ad-
                              dress, then each individual address is an aggre-
                              gation instance, and WAF counts  requests  sepa-
                              rately  for  each. The aggregation instances and
                              request counts for our example would be the fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                              o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                            o If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then
                              each individual HTTP method  is  an  aggregation
                              instance.  The aggregation instances and request
                              counts for our example would be the following:

                              o HTTP method POST: count 2

                              o HTTP method GET: count 2

                            o If the aggregation criteria is  IP  address  and
                              HTTP  method, then each IP address and each HTTP
                              method would contribute to the combined aggrega-
                              tion instance. The aggregation instances and re-
                              quest counts for our example would be  the  fol-
                              lowing:

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

                              o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

                              o IP  address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count
                                1

                            For any n-tuple of aggregation keys,  each  unique
                            combination of values for the keys defines a sepa-
                            rate aggregation instance, which  WAF  counts  and
                            rate-limits individually.

                            You  can  optionally nest another statement inside
                            the rate-based statement, to narrow the  scope  of
                            the  rule  so  that it only counts and rate limits
                            requests that match the nested statement. You  can
                            use  this  nested scope-down statement in conjunc-
                            tion with your aggregation key  specifications  or
                            you  can  just  count  and rate limit all requests
                            that match the scope-down statement, without addi-
                            tional aggregation. When you choose to just manage
                            all requests that match  a  scope-down  statement,
                            the aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                            You  cannot  nest  a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                            other statement, for example inside a NotStatement
                            or  OrStatement . You can define a RateBasedState-
                            ment inside a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                            For additional information about the options,  see
                            Rate  limiting web requests using rate-based rules
                            in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            If you only aggregate on the individual IP address
                            or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list
                            of IP addresses that WAF is currently rate  limit-
                            ing  for a rule through the API call GetRateBased-
                            StatementManagedKeys . This option is  not  avail-
                            able for other aggregation configurations.

                            WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for
                            each instance of a rate-based rule that  you  use.
                            For  example,  if  you provide the same rate-based
                            rule settings in two web ACLs,  each  of  the  two
                            rule  statements represents a separate instance of
                            the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking  and
                            management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule
                            inside a rule group, and then use that rule  group
                            in  multiple  places,  each use creates a separate
                            instance of the rate-based rule that gets its  own
                            tracking and management by WAF.

                            Limit -> (long)
                               The limit on requests per 5-minute period for a
                               single aggregation instance for the  rate-based
                               rule.  If  the  rate-based statement includes a
                               ScopeDownStatement , this limit is applied only
                               to the requests that match the statement.

                               Examples:

                               o If you aggregate on just the IP address, this
                                 is the limit on requests from any  single  IP
                                 address.

                               o If  you  aggregate on the HTTP method and the
                                 query argument name "city", then this is  the
                                 limit on requests for any single method, city
                                 pair.

                            EvaluationWindowSec -> (long)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, that WAF should
                               include  in  its  request  counts, looking back
                               from the current time. For example, for a  set-
                               ting  of  120,  when  WAF  checks  the rate, it
                               counts the requests for the 2  minutes  immedi-
                               ately  preceding  the  current time. Valid set-
                               tings are 60, 120, 300, and 600.

                               This setting doesn't determine  how  often  WAF
                               checks the rate, but how far back it looks each
                               time it checks. WAF checks the rate about every
                               10 seconds.

                               Default: 300 (5 minutes)

                            AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                               Setting that indicates how to aggregate the re-
                               quest counts.

                               NOTE:
                                   Web requests that are missing  any  of  the
                                   components  specified  in  the  aggregation
                                   keys are omitted from the  rate-based  rule
                                   evaluation and handling.

                               o CONSTANT  - Count and limit the requests that
                                 match the rate-based rule's scope-down state-
                                 ment.  With this option, the counted requests
                                 aren't  further  aggregated.  The  scope-down
                                 statement  is  the  only  specification used.
                                 When the count of all requests  that  satisfy
                                 the scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                 WAF applies the rule action to  all  requests
                                 that  satisfy the scope-down statement.  With
                                 this option, you must  configure  the  Scope-
                                 DownStatement property.

                               o CUSTOM_KEYS  -  Aggregate  the request counts
                                 using one or more web request  components  as
                                 the  aggregate  keys.  With  this option, you
                                 must specify the aggregate keys in  the  Cus-
                                 tomKeys  property.   To aggregate on only the
                                 IP address or only the forwarded IP  address,
                                 don't  use  custom keys. Instead, set the ag-
                                 gregate key type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                               o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate the  request  counts
                                 on  the  first  IP address in an HTTP header.
                                 With this option, you must specify the header
                                 to use in the ForwardedIPConfig property.  To
                                 aggregate on a combination of  the  forwarded
                                 IP  address  with  other  aggregate keys, use
                                 CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the  IP
                                 address  from  the web request origin. To ag-
                                 gregate on a combination of  the  IP  address
                                 with other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                            (  ... recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig -> (struc-
                            ture)
                               The configuration for inspecting  IP  addresses
                               in  an HTTP header that you specify, instead of
                               using the IP address that's reported by the web
                               request  origin.  Commonly,  this is the X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header, but  you  can  specify
                               any header name.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               This  is required if you specify a forwarded IP

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The name of the HTTP header to use for  the
                                   IP  address. For example, to use the X-For-
                                   warded-For (XFF) header, set this to X-For-
                                   warded-For .

                                   NOTE:

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            CustomKeys -> (list)
                               Specifies  the  aggregate  keys  to  use  in  a
                               rate-base rule.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies a single custom aggregate key for
                                   a rate-base rule.

                                   NOTE:

                                      components specified in the  aggregation
                                      keys  are  omitted  from  the rate-based

                                   Header -> (structure)
                                      Use the value of a header in the request
                                      as an aggregate key. Each distinct value
                                      in the header contributes to the  aggre-
                                      gation  instance.  If  you  use a single
                                      header as your  custom  key,  then  each
                                      value  fully  defines an aggregation in-
                                      stance.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the header to use.

                                      Use the request's HTTP method as an  ag-
                                      gregate  key.  Each distinct HTTP method
                                      contributes to the aggregation instance.

                                   ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  first  IP  address  in an HTTP
                                      header as an aggregate  key.  Each  dis-
                                      tinct  forwarded  IP address contributes
                                      to the aggregation instance.

                                      When you specify an IP or  forwarded  IP
                                      in  the  custom  key  settings, you must
                                      also specify at least one other  key  to
                                      use.  You can aggregate on only the for-
                                      warded IP  address  by  specifying  FOR-
                                      WARDED_IP in your rate-based statement's

                                      With this option, you must  specify  the
                                      header  to  use in the rate-based rule's
                                      ForwardedIPConfig property.

                                   IP -> (structure)
                                      Use the request's originating IP address
                                      as  an  aggregate  key. Each distinct IP
                                      address contributes to  the  aggregation
                                      instance.

                                      When  you  specify an IP or forwarded IP
                                      in the custom  key  settings,  you  must
                                      also  specify  at least one other key to
                                      use. You can aggregate on  only  the  IP
                                      address   by   specifying   IP  in  your
                                      rate-based statement's  AggregateKeyType
                                      .

                                      Use  the specified label namespace as an
                                      aggregate key. Each distinct fully qual-
                                      ified  label name that has the specified
                                      label namespace contributes to  the  ag-
                                      gregation  instance. If you use just one
                                      label namespace as your custom key, then
                                      each  label name fully defines an aggre-
                                      gation instance.

                                      This uses only  labels  that  have  been
                                      added  to  the request by rules that are
                                      evaluated before this rate-based rule in
                                      the web ACL.

                                      Use  the request's URI path as an aggre-

                                      you use just the URI path as your custom
                                      key, then each URI path fully defines an

                            A  logical  rule  statement  used to combine other
                            rule statements with AND logic. You  provide  more
                            than one  Statement within the AndStatement .

                            Statements -> (list)
                               The  statements  to combine with AND logic. You
                               can use any statements that can be nested.

                        ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                            A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are
                            defined in a managed rule group. To use this, pro-
                            vide  the  vendor  name  and  the name of the rule
                            group in this statement. You can retrieve the  re-
                            quired names by calling  ListAvailableManagedRule-

                            You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,  for
                            example  for use inside a NotStatement or OrState-
                            ment . You cannot use a managed rule group  inside
                            another  rule group. You can only reference a man-
                            aged rule group as a top-level statement within  a
                            rule that you define in a web ACL.

                               The  name of the managed rule group vendor. You
                               use this, along with the rule  group  name,  to
                               identify a rule group.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use
                               this, along with the vendor name,  to  identify
                               the rule group.

                            Version -> (string)
                               The  version  of the managed rule group to use.
                               If you specify this,  the  version  setting  is
                               fixed until you change it. If you don't specify
                               this, WAF uses the  vendor's  default  version,
                               and  then keeps the version at the vendor's de-
                               fault when the vendor updates the managed  rule
                               group settings.

                            ExcludedRules -> (list)

                                          gin , you  would  provide  the  path
                                          /web/login  . Login paths that start
                                          with the path that you  provide  are
                                          considered   a  match.  For  example
                                          /web/login matches the  login  paths
                                          /web/login     ,    /web/login/    ,

                                      RequestInspection -> (structure)
                                          The  criteria  for  inspecting login
                                          requests, used by the ATP rule group

                                             quest payload that contains  your
                                             customer's username.

                                             How  you  specify this depends on
                                             the  request  inspection  payload
                                             type.

                                             o For  JSON payloads, specify the

                                               .  For example,  for  the  JSON
                                               payload { "form": { "username":
                                               "THE_USERNAME" } } , the  user-
                                               name   field  specification  is
                                               /form/username .

                                             o For form encoded payload types,
                                               use  the  HTML  form names. For
                                               example, for an HTML form  with
                                               the  input  element named user-
                                               name1  ,  the  username   field
                                               specification is username1

                                             Identifier -> (string)
                                                 The   name  of  the  username
                                                 field.

                                                 How you specify this  depends
                                                 on   the  request  inspection
                                                 payload type.

                                                 o For JSON payloads,  specify
                                                   the   field  name  in  JSON

                                          For example, for the URL https://ex-

                        LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement to match against labels that have
                            been added to the web request by rules  that  have
                            already run in the web ACL.

                            The  label  match  statement provides the label or
                            namespace string to search for. The  label  string
                            can represent a part or all of the fully qualified
                            label name that had been added to the web request.
                            Fully  qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                            namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identifies
                            the rule group or web ACL context of the rule that
                            added the label. If you do not provide  the  fully
                            qualified  name  in  your  label match string, WAF
                            performs the search for labels that were added  in
                            the same context as the label match statement.

                            Scope -> (string)
                               Specify whether you want to match using the la-
                               bel name or just the namespace.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The string to match against.  The  setting  you
                               provide  for  this  depends on the match state-
                               ment's Scope setting:

                               o If the Scope  indicates  LABEL  ,  then  this
                                 specification  must  include the name and can
                                 include any  number  of  preceding  namespace
                                 specifications and prefix up to providing the
                                 fully qualified label name.

                               o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then  this
                                 specification  can include any number of con-
                                 tiguous namespace strings,  and  can  include
                                 the  entire  label  namespace prefix from the
                                 rule group or web ACL where the label  origi-
                                 nates.

                               Labels  are  case sensitive and components of a
                               label must be separated by colon,  for  example
                               NS1:NS2:name .

                        RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                            A rule statement used to search web request compo-
                            nents for a match against a single regular expres-
                            sion.

                            RegexString -> (string)
                               The string representing the regular expression.

                            FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                               The  part  of the web request that you want WAF
                               to inspect.

                               SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name
                                   of  the  header  to  inspect,  for example,
                                   User-Agent or Referer . This setting  isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:  "SingleHeader":  {  "Name":
                                   "haystack" }

                                   Alternately, you can filter and inspect all
                                   headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch set-
                                   ting.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the query header to inspect.

                               SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a single  query  argument.  Provide
                                   the  name of the query argument to inspect,
                                   such as UserName or SalesRegion . The  name
                                   can  be  up to 30 characters long and isn't
                                   case sensitive.

                                   Example  JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {
                                   "Name": "myArgument" }

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect.

                               AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all query arguments.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request URI path. This  is  the
                                   part  of  the web request that identifies a
                                   resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg
                                   .

                               QueryString -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the query string. This is the part
                                   of a URL that appears after a ?  character,
                                   if any.

                               Body -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request body as plain text. The
                                   request body immediately  follows  the  re-
                                   quest  headers.  This  is the part of a re-
                                   quest that  contains  any  additional  data
                                   that you want to send to your web server as
                                   the HTTP request body, such as data from  a
                                   form.

                                   A  limited  amount  of  the request body is
                                   forwarded to WAF for inspection by the  un-
                                   derlying  host  service.  For  regional re-
                                   sources, the limit is 8  KB  (8,192  bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is 16 KB  (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront
                                   distributions,  you  can increase the limit
                                   in the web ACL's  AssociationConfig  ,  for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For  information  about how to handle over-
                                   sized request bodies, see the  Body  object
                                   configuration.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Method -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indi-
                                   cates the type of operation  that  the  re-
                                   quest is asking the origin to perform.

                               JsonBody -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The re-
                                   quest body immediately follows the  request
                                   headers. This is the part of a request that
                                   contains any additional data that you  want
                                   to  send to your web server as the HTTP re-
                                   quest body, such as data from a form.

                                   A limited amount of  the  request  body  is
                                   forwarded  to WAF for inspection by the un-
                                   derlying host  service.  For  regional  re-
                                   sources,  the  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                   and for CloudFront distributions, the limit
                                   is  16  KB  (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront
                                   distributions, you can increase  the  limit
                                   in  the  web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for
                                   additional processing fees.

                                   For information about how to  handle  over-
                                   sized  request bodies, see the JsonBody ob-

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The patterns to look  for  in  the  JSON
                                      body.  WAF inspects the results of these
                                      pattern matches against the rule inspec-
                                      tion criteria.

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Match  all of the elements. See also
                                          MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or  the  IncludedPaths  setting, but
                                          not both.

                                      IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                          Match  only  the  specified  include
                                          paths. See also MatchScope in  Json-
                                          Body .

                                          Provide the include paths using JSON
                                          Pointer  syntax.  For  example, "In-
                                          cludedPaths":       ["/dogs/0/name",
                                          "/dogs/1/name"]  .  For  information
                                          about this syntax, see the  Internet
                                          Engineering  Task Force (IETF) docu-

                                          (JSON) Pointer .

                                          You must specify either this setting
                                          or the All setting, but not both.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Don't use this option to  include
                                             all  paths.  Instead, use the All
                                             setting.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the JSON to  match  against
                                      using  the MatchPattern . If you specify
                                      ALL , WAF matches against keys and  val-
                                      ues.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if it fails  to  com-
                                      pletely parse the JSON body. The options
                                      are the following:

                                      o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the  body
                                        as  plain  text.  WAF applies the text
                                        transformations and inspection  crite-
                                        ria  that you defined for the JSON in-
                                        spection to the body text string.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF
                                      parses and evaluates the content only up
                                      to the first parsing failure that it en-
                                      counters.

                                      WAF does its best to  parse  the  entire
                                      JSON  body,  but might be forced to stop
                                      for reasons such as invalid  characters,
                                      duplicate keys, truncation, and any con-
                                      tent whose root node isn't an object  or
                                      an array.

                                      WAF parses the JSON in the following ex-
                                      amples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                      o Missing                         comma:
                                        {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                      o Missing                         colon:
                                        {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      o Extra                          colons:
                                        {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the body is larger
                                      than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  sup-
                                      port  inspecting  the entire contents of
                                      the web request body if the body exceeds
                                      the  limit for the resource type. If the
                                      body is larger than the limit,  the  un-
                                      derlying  host service only forwards the
                                      contents that are below the limit to WAF
                                      for inspection.

                                      The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes)
                                      for regional resources and 16 KB (16,384
                                      bytes) for CloudFront distributions. For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL Associa-
                                      tionConfig , for  additional  processing
                                      fees.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body
                                        contents  normally,  according  to the
                                        rule inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                      You  can  combine  the MATCH or NO_MATCH
                                      settings for oversize handling with your
                                      rule  and  web  ACL  action settings, so
                                      that you block any request whose body is
                                      over the limit.

                                      Default: CONTINUE

                               Headers -> (structure)
                                   Inspect  the request headers. You must con-
                                   figure scope and pattern  matching  filters
                                   in the Headers object, to define the set of
                                   headers to and the  parts  of  the  headers
                                   that WAF inspects.

                                   Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a re-
                                   quest's headers  and  only  the  first  200
                                   headers are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by the underlying host  service.  You  must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize header
                                   content in the Headers object. WAF  applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the headers
                                   that it receives from the  underlying  host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of headers to inspect in a web request.

                                      You must specify  exactly  one  setting:
                                      either  All  ,  IncludedHeaders , or Ex-
                                      cludedHeaders .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Exclud-
                                      edHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToEx-
                                      clude2" ] }

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all headers.

                                      IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers that have a
                                          key  that matches one of the strings
                                          specified here.

                                          (string)

                                      ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the headers whose  keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the headers to  match  with
                                      the  rule  inspection  criteria.  If you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All  does  not require a match to be
                                          found in the keys and a match to  be
                                          found  in  the values. It requires a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values  or  both. To require a match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match rules, one that  inspects  the
                                          keys  and  another that inspects the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               Cookies -> (structure)
                                   Inspect the request cookies. You must  con-
                                   figure  scope  and pattern matching filters
                                   in the Cookies object, to define the set of
                                   cookies  and  the parts of the cookies that
                                   WAF inspects.

                                   Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of  a  re-
                                   quest's  cookies  and  only  the  first 200
                                   cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspection
                                   by  the  underlying  host service. You must
                                   configure how to handle any oversize cookie
                                   content  in the Cookies object. WAF applies
                                   the pattern matching filters to the cookies
                                   that  it  receives from the underlying host
                                   service.

                                   MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                      The filter to use to identify the subset
                                      of cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                      You  must  specify  exactly one setting:
                                      either All , IncludedCookies  ,  or  Ex-
                                      cludedCookies .

                                      Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Includ-

                                      All -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all cookies.

                                      IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect only the cookies that have a
                                          key that matches one of the  strings
                                          specified here.

                                      ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                          Inspect  only the cookies whose keys
                                          don't match any of the strings spec-
                                          ified here.

                                          (string)

                                   MatchScope -> (string)
                                      The parts of the cookies to inspect with
                                      the rule  inspection  criteria.  If  you
                                      specify ALL , WAF inspects both keys and
                                      values.
                                          All does not require a match  to  be
                                          found  in the keys and a match to be
                                          found in the values. It  requires  a
                                          match to be found in the keys or the
                                          values or both. To require  a  match
                                          in the keys and in the values, use a
                                          logical AND statement to combine two
                                          match  rules,  one that inspects the
                                          keys and another that  inspects  the
                                          values.

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the cookies of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF  can  inspect.  WAF does not support
                                      inspecting the entire  contents  of  re-
                                      quest  cookies  when  they  exceed  8 KB
                                      (8192 bytes) or 200 total  cookies.  The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum of 200 cookies and at most 8  KB  of
                                      cookie contents to WAF.

                                      The  options  for  oversize handling are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available cook-
                                        ies  normally,  according  to the rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                   Inspect a string containing the list of the
                                   request's header names, ordered as they ap-
                                   pear  in  the web request that WAF receives
                                   for inspection. WAF  generates  the  string
                                   and  then  uses  that as the field to match
                                   component in its inspection. WAF  separates
                                   the header names in the string using colons
                                   and   no   added   spaces,   for    example
                                   host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                                   erer .

                                   OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                      What WAF should do if the headers of the
                                      request are more numerous or larger than
                                      WAF can inspect. WAF  does  not  support
                                      inspecting  the  entire  contents of re-
                                      quest headers  when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                      (8192  bytes)  or 200 total headers. The
                                      underlying host service forwards a maxi-
                                      mum  of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of
                                      header contents to WAF.

                                      The options for  oversize  handling  are
                                      the following:

                                      o CONTINUE - Inspect the available head-
                                        ers normally, according  to  the  rule
                                        inspection criteria.

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                   Match against  the  request's  JA3  finger-
                                   print.  The JA3 fingerprint is a 32-charac-
                                   ter hash derived from the TLS Client  Hello
                                   of  an  incoming  request. This fingerprint
                                   serves  as  a  unique  identifier  for  the
                                   client's  TLS configuration. WAF calculates
                                   and logs this fingerprint for each  request
                                   that  has  enough TLS Client Hello informa-
                                   tion for the calculation.  Almost  all  web
                                   requests include this information.

                                   NOTE:
                                      You  can  use  this  choice  only with a
                                      string match ByteMatchStatement with the
                                      PositionalConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                                   You  can  obtain  the  JA3  fingerprint for
                                   client requests from the web ACL  logs.  If
                                   WAF  is  able to calculate the fingerprint,
                                   it includes it in the logs. For information
                                   about the logging fields, see Log fields in
                                   the WAF Developer Guide .

                                   Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from the
                                   logs  in your string match statement speci-
                                   fication, to match with any future requests
                                   that have the same TLS configuration.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      JA3 fingerprint.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            TextTransformations -> (list)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests  in  an effort to bypass detection. Text
                               transformations are used in rule  match  state-
                               ments,  to  transform  the FieldToMatch request
                               component before  inspecting  it,  and  they're
                               used  in  rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                               form request components before  using  them  as
                               custom  aggregation keys. If you specify one or
                               more transformations to apply, WAF performs all
                               transformations   on   the  specified  content,
                               starting from the lowest priority setting,  and
                               then uses the transformed component contents.

                               (structure)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Sets the relative processing  order  for
                                      multiple  transformations. WAF processes
                                      all transformations, from lowest  prior-
                                      ity  to  highest,  before inspecting the
                                      transformed  content.   The   priorities
                                      don't  need  to be consecutive, but they
                                      must all be different.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      For detailed descriptions of each of the
                                      transformation types, see Text transfor-

                     ManagedRuleGroupConfigs -> (list)
                        Additional information that's used by a  managed  rule
                        group. Many managed rule groups don't require this.

                        The rule groups used for intelligent threat mitigation
                        require additional configuration:

                          in the login request payload of  data  such  as  the
                          username and password.

                        o Use  the AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet configura-
                          tion object to configure the protection  level  that
                          you want the Bot Control rule group to use.

                        (structure)
                            Additional  information  that's  used by a managed
                            rule group. Many managed rule groups don't require
                            this.

                            The  rule groups used for intelligent threat miti-
                            gation require additional configuration:

                                   o For  form  encoded payload types, use the
                                     HTML form names. For example, for an HTML
                                     form  with  the input element named user-
                                     name1 , the username field  specification
                                     is username1

                               Identifier -> (string)
                                   The name of the password field.

                                   How you specify this depends on the request
                                   inspection payload type.

                                   o For JSON payloads, specify the field name
                                     in JSON pointer syntax.  For  information

                                     (JSON) Pointer .  For  example,  for  the
                                     JSON  payload  {  "form":  {  "password":
                                     "THE_PASSWORD" } } , the  password  field
                                     specification is /form/password .

                                   o For  form  encoded payload types, use the
                                     HTML form names. For example, for an HTML
                                     form  with  the input element named pass-

                            AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet -> (structure)
                               Additional configuration for using the  account
                               takeover  prevention  (ATP) managed rule group,
                               AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet . Use this to provide
                               login  request  information  to the rule group.
                               For web ACLs that protect CloudFront  distribu-
                               tions, use this to also provide the information
                               about how your distribution responds  to  login
                               requests.

                               This configuration replaces the individual con-
                               figuration fields in ManagedRuleGroupConfig and
                               provides additional feature configuration.

                               LoginPath -> (string)
                                   The path of the login endpoint for your ap-
                                   plication.  For  example,   for   the   URL
                                   https://example.com/web/login  ,  you would
                                   provide the path /web/login .  Login  paths
                                   that  start  with the path that you provide
                                   are  considered  a   match.   For   example
                                   /web/login matches the login paths /web/lo-
                                   gin , /web/login/ ,  /web/loginPage  ,  and
                                   /web/login/thisPage , but doesn't match the
                                   login path /home/web/login or  /website/lo-
                                   gin .

                                   The  rule group inspects only HTTP POST re-
                                   quests to your specified login endpoint.

                               RequestInspection -> (structure)
                                   The criteria for inspecting login requests,
                                   used by the ATP rule group to validate cre-
                                   dentials usage.

                                   PayloadType -> (string)
                                      The payload type  for  your  login  end-
                                      point, either JSON or form encoded.

                                   UsernameField -> (structure)
                                      The  name  of  the  field in the request
                                      payload that  contains  your  customer's
                                      username.

                                      How  you specify this depends on the re-
                                      quest inspection payload type.

                                      o For JSON payloads, specify  the  field
                                        name  in  JSON pointer syntax. For in-

                                        is /form/username .

                                      o For  form  encoded  payload types, use
                                        the HTML form names. For example,  for
                                        an  HTML  form  with the input element
                                        named username1 , the  username  field
                                        specification is username1

                                      Identifier -> (string)
                                          The name of the username field.

                                          How  you specify this depends on the
                                          request inspection payload type.

                                          o For  JSON  payloads,  specify  the
                                            field name in JSON pointer syntax.

                                   The criteria for  inspecting  responses  to
                                   account creation requests, used by the ACFP
                                   rule group to track account  creation  suc-
                                   cess rates.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Response inspection is available only in
                                      web ACLs that protect Amazon  CloudFront
                                      distributions.

                                   The ACFP rule group evaluates the responses
                                   that your protected resources send back  to
                                   client  account  creation attempts, keeping
                                   count of  successful  and  failed  attempts
                                   from  each  IP  address and client session.
                                   Using this information, the rule group  la-
                                   bels  and  mitigates  requests  from client
                                   sessions and IP addresses that have had too
                                   many  successful  account creation attempts
                                   in a short amount of time.

                                   StatusCode -> (structure)
                                      Configures inspection  of  the  response
                                      status  code for success and failure in-
                                      dicators.

                                      SuccessCodes -> (list)
                                          Status codes in  the  response  that
                                          indicate  a  successful login or ac-
                                          count  creation   attempt.   To   be
                                          counted  as  a success, the response
                                          status code must match one of these.
                                          Each  code  must be unique among the
                                          success and failure status codes.

                                          JSON example: "SuccessCodes": [ 200,

                                          indicate a failed login  or  account
                                          creation attempt. To be counted as a
                                          failure, the  response  status  code
                                          must  match  one of these. Each code
                                          must be unique among the success and
                                          failure status codes.

                                      JSON for success and failure indicators.
                                      WAF can inspect the first  65,536  bytes
                                      (64 KB) of the response JSON.

                                      Identifier -> (string)
                                          The  identifier  for  the  value  to
                                          match against in the JSON. The iden-
                                          tifier  must  be an exact match, in-
                                          cluding case.

                                          attempt. To be counted as a success,
                                          the value must be  an  exact  match,
                                          including  case.  Each value must be
                                          unique among the success and failure
                                          values.

                        want to change.

                        You can use overrides for testing, for example you can
                        override all of rule actions to Count and then monitor
                        the resulting count metrics to understand how the rule
                        group would handle your web traffic. You can also per-

                 LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement to match against labels that  have  been
                     added  to  the web request by rules that have already run
                     in the web ACL.

                     The label match statement provides the label or namespace
                     string  to  search  for. The label string can represent a
                     part or all of the fully qualified label  name  that  had
                     been  added  to  the  web request. Fully qualified labels
                     have a prefix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                     prefix  identifies  the  rule group or web ACL context of
                     the rule that added the label. If you do not provide  the
                     fully qualified name in your label match string, WAF per-
                     forms the search for labels that were added in  the  same
                     context as the label match statement.

                     Scope -> (string)
                        Specify whether you want to match using the label name
                        or just the namespace.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The string to match against. The setting  you  provide
                        for  this  depends on the match statement's Scope set-
                        ting:

                        o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then this  specifica-
                          tion  must include the name and can include any num-
                          ber of preceding namespace specifications and prefix
                          up to providing the fully qualified label name.

                        o If  the Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then this speci-
                          fication can include any number of contiguous  name-
                          space  strings,  and  can  include  the entire label
                          namespace prefix from the  rule  group  or  web  ACL
                          where the label originates.

                        Labels  are  case  sensitive and components of a label
                        must be separated by colon, for example NS1:NS2:name .

                 RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                     A rule statement used to search  web  request  components
                     for a match against a single regular expression.

                     RegexString -> (string)
                        The string representing the regular expression.

                     FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to in-
                        spect.

                        SingleHeader -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single header. Provide the name  of  the
                            header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Ref-
                            erer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                            Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack"
                            }

                            Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all head-
                            ers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query header to inspect.

                        SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                            Inspect a single query argument. Provide the  name
                            of the query argument to inspect, such as UserName
                            or SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30  charac-
                            ters long and isn't case sensitive.

                            Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {  "Name":
                            "myArgument" }

                            Name -> (string)
                               The name of the query argument to inspect.

                        AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                            Inspect all query arguments.

                        UriPath -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request URI path. This is the part  of
                            the  web  request  that identifies a resource, for
                            example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        QueryString -> (structure)
                            Inspect the query string. This is the  part  of  a
                            URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        Body -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the  request  body as plain text. The re-
                            quest body immediately follows the  request  head-
                            ers.  This  is the part of a request that contains
                            any additional data that you want to send to  your
                            web  server as the HTTP request body, such as data
                            from a form.

                            A limited amount of the request body is  forwarded
                            to  WAF for inspection by the underlying host ser-
                            vice. For regional resources, the limit  is  8  KB
                            (8,192  bytes)  and  for CloudFront distributions,
                            the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  CloudFront
                            distributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                            web ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional  pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if the body is  larger  than
                               WAF  can inspect. WAF does not support inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if  the body exceeds the limit for the resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying  host service only forwards the con-
                               tents that are below the limit to WAF  for  in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional resources and 16 KB (16,384  bytes)  for
                               CloudFront  distributions.  For CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available body con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  settings
                               for  oversize  handling  with your rule and web
                               ACL action settings, so that you block any  re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Method -> (structure)
                            Inspect  the HTTP method. The method indicates the
                            type of operation that the request is  asking  the
                            origin to perform.

                        JsonBody -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body
                            immediately follows the request headers.  This  is
                            the part of a request that contains any additional
                            data that you want to send to your web  server  as
                            the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                            A  limited amount of the request body is forwarded
                            to WAF for inspection by the underlying host  ser-
                            vice.  For  regional  resources, the limit is 8 KB
                            (8,192 bytes) and  for  CloudFront  distributions,
                            the  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront
                            distributions, you can increase the limit  in  the
                            web  ACL's AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                            cessing fees.

                            quest  bodies,  see the JsonBody object configura-
                            tion.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The patterns to look for in the JSON body.  WAF
                               inspects  the  results of these pattern matches
                               against the rule inspection criteria.

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Match all of the elements. See also  Match-
                                   Scope in  JsonBody .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                               IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                   Match only the specified include paths. See
                                   also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                   Provide   the   include  paths  using  JSON
                                   Pointer  syntax.  For  example,  "Included-
                                   Paths":  ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] .
                                   For information about this syntax, see  the
                                   Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) doc-
                                   umentation   JavaScript   Object   Notation
                                   (JSON) Pointer .

                                   You must specify either this setting or the
                                   All setting, but not both.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Don't use this  option  to  include  all
                                      paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The  parts  of  the JSON to match against using
                               the MatchPattern . If you  specify  ALL  ,  WAF
                               matches against keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the keys and a match to  be  found  in  the
                                   values.  It requires a match to be found in
                                   the keys or the values or both. To  require
                                   a  match in the keys and in the values, use
                                   a logical  AND  statement  to  combine  two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               What WAF should do if it  fails  to  completely
                               parse  the  JSON body. The options are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect  the  body  as
                                 plain  text. WAF applies the text transforma-
                                 tions and inspection criteria  that  you  de-
                                 fined  for  the  JSON  inspection to the body
                                 text string.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               If  you  don't provide this setting, WAF parses
                               and evaluates the content only up to the  first
                               parsing failure that it encounters.

                               WAF  does  its  best  to  parse the entire JSON
                               body, but might be forced to stop  for  reasons
                               such  as  invalid  characters,  duplicate keys,
                               truncation, and any  content  whose  root  node
                               isn't an object or an array.

                               WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples
                               as two valid key, value pairs:

                               o Missing                                comma:
                                 {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                               o Missing                                colon:
                                 {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                               o Extra                                 colons:
                                 {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should do if the body is larger than
                               WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  inspect-
                               ing the entire contents of the web request body
                               if the body exceeds the limit for the  resource
                               type. If the body is larger than the limit, the
                               underlying host service only forwards the  con-
                               tents  that  are below the limit to WAF for in-
                               spection.

                               The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for re-
                               gional  resources  and 16 KB (16,384 bytes) for
                               CloudFront distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  you  can increase the limit in the
                               web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional pro-
                               cessing fees.

                               The  options for oversize handling are the fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  body  con-
                                 tents normally, according to the rule inspec-
                                 tion criteria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                               You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings
                               for oversize handling with your  rule  and  web
                               ACL  action settings, so that you block any re-
                               quest whose body is over the limit.

                               Default: CONTINUE

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request headers.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Headers
                            object, to define the set of headers  to  and  the
                            parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                            headers and only the first 200  headers  are  for-
                            warded  to  WAF  for  inspection by the underlying
                            host service. You must configure how to handle any
                            oversize header content in the Headers object. WAF
                            applies the pattern matching filters to the  head-
                            ers that it receives from the underlying host ser-
                            vice.

                            MatchPattern -> (structure)
                               The filter to use to  identify  the  subset  of
                               headers to inspect in a web request.

                               You  must  specify  exactly one setting: either
                               All , IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all headers.

                               IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  headers that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   (string)

                               ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the headers whose keys don't
                                   match any of the strings specified here.

                                   (string)

                            MatchScope -> (string)
                               The parts of the headers to match with the rule
                               inspection  criteria.  If you specify ALL , WAF
                               inspects both keys and values.
                                   All does not require a match to be found in
                                   the  keys  and  a  match to be found in the
                                   values. It requires a match to be found  in
                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can
                               inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the
                               entire contents of request  headers  when  they
                               exceed  8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                               The underlying host service forwards a  maximum
                               of  200 headers and at most 8 KB of header con-
                               tents to WAF.

                               The options for oversize handling are the  fol-
                               lowing:

                               o CONTINUE - Inspect the available headers nor-
                                 mally, according to the rule inspection  cri-
                                 teria.

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        Cookies -> (structure)
                            Inspect the request cookies.  You  must  configure
                            scope  and pattern matching filters in the Cookies
                            object, to define the set of cookies and the parts
                            of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                            Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's

                               All -> (structure)
                                   Inspect all cookies.

                               IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                   Inspect  only  the  cookies that have a key
                                   that matches one of the  strings  specified
                                   here.

                                   the  keys or the values or both. To require
                                   a match in the keys and in the values,  use
                                   a  logical  AND  statement  to  combine two
                                   match rules, one that inspects the keys and
                                   another that inspects the values.

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the re-

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                            Inspect a string containing the list  of  the  re-
                            quest's  header  names,  ordered as they appear in
                            the web request that WAF receives for  inspection.
                            WAF generates the string and then uses that as the
                            field to match component in  its  inspection.  WAF
                            separates  the  header  names  in the string using
                            colons  and   no   added   spaces,   for   example
                            host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer .

                            OversizeHandling -> (string)
                               What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the re-
                               quest are more numerous or larger than WAF  can

                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                            Match against the request's JA3  fingerprint.  The
                            JA3  fingerprint  is  a  32-character hash derived
                            from the TLS Client Hello of an incoming  request.
                            This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
                            the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and
                            logs  this  fingerprint  for each request that has
                            enough TLS Client Hello information for the calcu-
                            lation.  Almost  all web requests include this in-
                            formation.

                            NOTE:
                               You can use this  choice  only  with  a  string
                               match  ByteMatchStatement  with the Positional-
                               Constraint set to EXACTLY .

                            You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client  re-
                            quests  from  the  web ACL logs. If WAF is able to
                            calculate the fingerprint, it includes it  in  the
                            logs.  For  information  about the logging fields,
                            see Log fields in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs
                            in  your  string match statement specification, to
                            match with any future requests that have the  same
                            TLS configuration.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     TextTransformations -> (list)
                        Text transformations eliminate  some  of  the  unusual
                        formatting  that  attackers  use in web requests in an
                        effort to bypass detection. Text  transformations  are
                        used in rule match statements, to transform the Field-
                        ToMatch request component before  inspecting  it,  and
                        they're  used in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                        form request components before using  them  as  custom
                        aggregation keys. If you specify one or more transfor-
                        mations to apply, WAF performs all transformations  on
                        the specified content, starting from the lowest prior-
                        ity setting, and then uses the  transformed  component
                        contents.

                        (structure)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in

                            Priority -> (integer)
                               Sets the relative processing order for multiple
                               transformations. WAF processes all  transforma-
                               tions,  from lowest priority to highest, before
                               inspecting the transformed content. The priori-
                               ties  don't  need  to  be consecutive, but they
                               must all be different.

                            Type -> (string)
                               For detailed descriptions of each of the trans-
                               formation  types,  see  Text transformations in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

              Action -> (structure)
                 The action that WAF should take on  a  web  request  when  it
                 matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level can
                 override the rule action setting.

                 This is used only for rules whose statements do not reference
                 a rule group. Rule statements that reference a rule group in-
                 clude RuleGroupReferenceStatement and  ManagedRuleGroupState-
                 ment .

                 You must specify either this Action setting or the rule Over-
                 rideAction setting, but not both:

                 o If the rule statement does not reference a rule group,  use
                   this  rule  action setting and not the rule override action
                   setting.

                 o If the rule statement references  a  rule  group,  use  the
                   override action setting and not this action setting.

                 Block -> (structure)
                     Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                     CustomResponse -> (structure)
                        Defines a custom response for the web request.

                        ResponseCode -> (integer)
                            The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                            For  a  list  of  status codes that you can use in
                            your custom responses, see Supported status  codes
                            for custom response in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                            References  the response body that you want WAF to
                            return to the web request client. You can define a
                            custom response for a rule action or a default web
                            ACL action that is set to block. To do  this,  you
                            first  define  the  response body key and value in
                            the CustomResponseBodies setting for  the   WebACL
                            or   RuleGroup  where you want to use it. Then, in
                            the rule action or web ACL default action BlockAc-
                            tion  setting, you reference the response body us-
                            ing this key.

                        ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                            The HTTP headers to use in the response.  You  can
                            specify  any header name except for content-type .
                            Duplicate header names are not allowed.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

              OverrideAction -> (structure)
                 The action to use in the place of  the  action  that  results
                 from  the  rule  group evaluation. Set the override action to
                 none to leave the result of the rule group alone. Set  it  to
                 count to override the result to count only.

                 You  can  only  use this for rule statements that reference a
                 rule group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement and ManagedRule-
                 GroupStatement .

                 NOTE:
                     This  option  is  usually set to none. It does not affect
                     how the rules in the rule group  are  evaluated.  If  you
                     want  the  rules in the rule group to only count matches,
                     do not use this and instead use the rule action  override
                     option,  with  Count action, in your rule group reference
                     statement settings.

                 Count -> (structure)
                     Override the rule group evaluation result to count only.

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how  the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If you

                        matches,  do not use this and instead use the rule ac-
                        tion override option, with Count action, in your  rule
                        group reference statement settings.

                        InsertHeaders -> (list)
                            The  HTTP  headers to insert into the request. Du-
                            plicate header names are not allowed.

                            For information about the limits on count and size
                            for  custom request and response settings, see WAF
                            quotas in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            (structure)
                               A custom header for custom request and response
                               handling.  This  is used in  CustomResponse and
                               CustomRequestHandling .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the custom header.

                 None -> (structure)
                     Don't override the rule group evaluation result. This  is
                     the most common setting.

              RuleLabels -> (list)
                 Labels  to  apply  to  web requests that match the rule match
                 statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching web
                 requests.  A  fully qualified label is the concatenation of a
                 label namespace and a rule label. The rule's  rule  group  or
                 web ACL defines the label namespace.

                 Rules  that  run  after  this  rule  in the web ACL can match
                 against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement .

                 For each label, provide a  case-sensitive  string  containing
                 optional  namespaces  and a label name, according to the fol-
                 lowing guidelines:

                 o Separate each component of the label with a colon.

                 o Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

                 o You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.

                 o Don't use the following reserved words in your label speci-
                   fication: aws , waf , managed , rulegroup , webacl , regex-
                   patternset , or ipset .

                 For example, myLabelName or nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLabelName
                 .

                 (structure)
                     A single label container. This is used as an element of a
                     label array in multiple contexts, for example, in RuleLa-
                     bels  inside  a   Rule  and  in Labels inside a  Sampled-
                     HTTPRequest .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The label string.

              VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
                 Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request
                 sample collection.

                 If  you change the name of a Rule after you create it and you
                 want the rule's metric name to reflect the change, update the
                 metric  name  as  well.  WAF doesn't automatically update the
                 metric name.

                 SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether WAF should store a sampling of the  web
                     requests  that  match the rules. You can view the sampled
                     requests through the WAF console.

                 CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the associated resource  sends  metrics
                     to  Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics,
                     see WAF Metrics in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     For web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that  have
                     the  web  ACL default action applied. WAF applies the de-
                     fault action to web requests that pass the inspection  of
                     all  rules in the web ACL without being either allowed or
                     blocked. For more information, see The  web  ACL  default
                     action in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     A  name  of  the  Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The
                     name can contain only the characters: A-Z,  a-z,  0-9,  -
                     (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to
                     128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or  met-
                     ric  names that are reserved for WAF, for example All and
                     Default_Action .

              CaptchaConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations.  If  you
                 don't specify this, WAF uses the CAPTCHA configuration that's
                 defined for the web ACL.

                 ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                     Determines how long a CAPTCHA timestamp in the token  re-
                     mains  valid  after  the  client  successfully  solves  a
                     CAPTCHA puzzle.

                     ImmunityTime -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  a  CAPTCHA  or
                        challenge  timestamp  is  considered valid by WAF. The
                        default setting is 300.

                        For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

              ChallengeConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies how WAF should handle Challenge evaluations. If you
                 don't  specify  this,  WAF  uses  the challenge configuration
                 that's defined for the web ACL.

                 ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                     Determines how long a challenge timestamp  in  the  token
                     remains valid after the client successfully responds to a
                     challenge.

                     ImmunityTime -> (long)
                        The amount of time, in  seconds,  that  a  CAPTCHA  or
                        challenge  timestamp  is  considered valid by WAF. The
                        default setting is 300.

                        For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

            ...
          ]

       --visibility-config (structure)
          Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample
          collection.

          SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  WAF  should  store a sampling of the web re-
              quests that match the rules. You can view the  sampled  requests
              through the WAF console.

          CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether the associated resource sends metrics to Ama-
              zon CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics, see WAF  Met-
              rics in the WAF Developer Guide .

              For web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that have the web
              ACL default action applied. WAF applies the  default  action  to
              web  requests  that  pass the inspection of all rules in the web
              ACL without being either allowed or blocked. For  more  informa-
              tion,  see The web ACL default action in the WAF Developer Guide
              .

          MetricName -> (string)
              A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The  name  can
              contain  only  the  characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _
              (underscore). The name can be from one to 128  characters  long.
              It  can't  contain  whitespace or metric names that are reserved
              for WAF, for example All and Default_Action .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SampledRequestsEnabled=boolean,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=boolean,MetricName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SampledRequestsEnabled": true|false,
            "CloudWatchMetricsEnabled": true|false,
            "MetricName": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of key:value pairs to associate with the resource.

          (structure)
              A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services resource. Tags  are
              key:value  pairs  that you can use to categorize and manage your
              resources, for purposes like billing or other management.  Typi-
              cally, the tag key represents a category, such as "environment",
              and the tag value represents a specific value within that  cate-
              gory,  such  as  "test,"  "development," or "production". Or you
              might set the tag key to "customer" and the value  to  the  cus-
              tomer  name  or  ID.  You can specify one or more tags to add to
              each Amazon Web Services resource, up to 50 tags for a resource.

              You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources  that  you  manage
              through  WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern
              sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF console.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  key to describe a category of information, such as "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use  a
                 tag  value  to  describe  a specific value within a category,
                 such as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are  case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --custom-response-bodies (map)
          A  map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you create a
          rule with a block action, you can send a custom response to the  web
          request.  You define these for the web ACL, and then use them in the
          rules and default actions that you define in the web ACL.

          For information about customizing web requests  and  responses,  see
          Customizing  web  requests and responses in WAF in the WAF Developer
          Guide .

          For information about the limits on count and size  for  custom  re-
          quest  and  response  settings,  see WAF quotas in the WAF Developer
          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The response body to use in a custom response to a web  request.
              This  is referenced by key from  CustomResponse  CustomResponse-
              BodyKey .

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The type of content in the payload that you are  defining  in
                 the Content string.

              Content -> (string)
                 The payload of the custom response.

                 You  can use JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do this,
                 you must specify JSON content in the ContentType setting.

                 For information about the limits on count and size for custom
                 request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in the WAF De-
                 veloper Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=ContentType=string,Content=string,KeyName2=ContentType=string,Content=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "ContentType": "TEXT_PLAIN"|"TEXT_HTML"|"APPLICATION_JSON",
                "Content": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --captcha-config (structure)
          Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations for  rules  that
          don't  have  their  own CaptchaConfig settings. If you don't specify
          this, WAF uses its default settings for CaptchaConfig .

          ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
              Determines how long a CAPTCHA timestamp  in  the  token  remains
              valid after the client successfully solves a CAPTCHA puzzle.

              ImmunityTime -> (long)
                 The  amount  of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA or challenge
                 timestamp is considered valid by WAF. The default setting  is
                 300.

                 For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
              "ImmunityTime": long
            }
          }

       --challenge-config (structure)
          Specifies how WAF should handle challenge evaluations for rules that
          don't have their own ChallengeConfig settings. If you don't  specify
          this, WAF uses its default settings for ChallengeConfig .

          ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
              Determines  how  long a challenge timestamp in the token remains
              valid after the client successfully responds to a challenge.

              ImmunityTime -> (long)
                 The amount of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA  or  challenge
                 timestamp  is considered valid by WAF. The default setting is
                 300.

                 For the Challenge action, the minimum setting is 300.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ImmunityTimeProperty={ImmunityTime=long}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ImmunityTimeProperty": {
              "ImmunityTime": long
            }
          }

       --token-domains (list)
          Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token.
          This  enables  the use of tokens across multiple protected websites.
          When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify
          a list of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the  domain  of
          the  protected  resource.  With a token domain list, WAF accepts the
          resource's host domain plus all domains in the  token  domain  list,
          including their prefixed subdomains.

          Example   JSON:   "TokenDomains":  {  "mywebsite.com",  "myotherweb-
          site.com" }

          Public suffixes aren't allowed. For example, you can't use gov.au or
          co.uk as token domains.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --association-config (structure)
          Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web
          ACL and protected resources.

          Use this to customize the maximum size of the request body that your
          protected  CloudFront  distributions  forward to WAF for inspection.
          The default is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).

          NOTE:
              You are charged additional fees when  your  protected  resources
              forward  body  sizes  that are larger than the default. For more
              information, see WAF Pricing .

          RequestBody -> (map)
              Customizes the maximum size of the request body that  your  pro-
              tected  CloudFront  distributions forward to WAF for inspection.
              The default size is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).

              NOTE:
                 You are charged additional fees when your protected resources
                 forward body sizes that are larger than the default. For more
                 information, see WAF Pricing .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Customizes the maximum size of the  request  body  that  your
                 protected CloudFront distributions forward to WAF for inspec-
                 tion. The default size is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).

                 NOTE:
                     You are charged additional fees when your  protected  re-
                     sources  forward  body sizes that are larger than the de-
                     fault. For more information, see WAF Pricing .

                 This is used in the AssociationConfig of the web ACL.

                 DefaultSizeInspectionLimit -> (string)
                     Specifies the maximum size of the web request body compo-
                     nent  that  an  associated CloudFront distribution should
                     send to WAF for inspection. This applies to statements in
                     the web ACL that inspect the body or JSON body.

                     Default: 16 KB (16,384 bytes)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RequestBody={KeyName1={DefaultSizeInspectionLimit=string},KeyName2={DefaultSizeInspectionLimit=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

                }
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a web ACL

       The  following  create-web-acl  command  creates a web ACL for regional
       use. The rule statements for the web ACL are provided in a JSON-format-
       ted file.

          aws wafv2 create-web-acl \
              --name TestWebAcl \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --default-action Allow={} \
              --visibility-config SampledRequestsEnabled=true,CloudWatchMetricsEnabled=true,MetricName=TestWebAclMetrics \
              --rules file://waf-rule.json \
              --region us-west-2

OUTPUT
       Summary -> (structure)
          High-level information about a  WebACL , returned by operations like
          create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
          use  to retrieve and manage a WebACL , and the ARN, that you provide
          to operations like  AssociateWebACL .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  for the web ACL. This ID is returned in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.

          LockToken -> (string)
              A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your
              get and list requests, to mark the state of the  entity  at  the
              time  of  the  request. To make changes to the entity associated
              with the token, you provide the token to operations like  update
              and  delete  . WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have
              been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change
              has  been  made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockExcep-
              tion . If this happens, perform another get , and  use  the  new
              token returned by that operation.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
