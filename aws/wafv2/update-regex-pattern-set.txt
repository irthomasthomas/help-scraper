UPDATE-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()                          UPDATE-REGEX-PATTERN-SET()



NAME
       update-regex-pattern-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the specified  RegexPatternSet .

       NOTE:
              This  operation  completely  replaces the mutable specifications
              that you already have for the regex pattern set  with  the  ones
              that you provide to this call.

              To modify a regex pattern set, do the following:

              o Retrieve it by calling  GetRegexPatternSet

              o Update its settings as needed

              o Provide  the  complete regex pattern set specification to this
                call

          Temporary inconsistencies during updates

       When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes
       take  a  small  amount  of time to propagate to all areas where the re-
       sources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a
       number of minutes.

       The  following  are  examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you
       might notice during change propagation:

       o After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate  it  with  a  re-
         source, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is un-
         available.

       o After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the  new  rule  group  rules
         might  be  in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in
         another.

       o After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old  action
         in some places and the new action in others.

       o After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking
         rule, the new address might be blocked in one area  while  still  al-
         lowed in another.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the set. You cannot change the name after you create the
          set.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync  GraphQL  API,  an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner ser-
          vice, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the set. This ID  is  returned  in  the  re-
          sponses  to  create  and list commands. You provide it to operations
          like update and delete.

       --description (string)
          A description of the set that helps with identification.

       --regular-expression-list (list)
          (structure)
              A single regular expression. This is used in a   RegexPatternSet
              .

              RegexString -> (string)
                 The string representing the regular expression.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegexString=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegexString": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  modify the settings for an existing regex pattern set

       The following update-regex-pattern-set updates  the  settings  for  the
       specified  regex  pattern  set. This call requires an ID, which you can
       obtain from the call, list-regex-pattern-sets, and a lock  token  which
       you   can   obtain   from   the   calls,   list-regex-pattern-sets  and
       get-regex-pattern-set. This call also returns a lock token that you can
       use for a subsequent update.

          aws wafv2 update-regex-pattern-set \
              --name ExampleRegex \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111 \
              --regular-expression-list RegexString="^.+$"  \
              --lock-token ed207e9c-82e9-4a77-aadd-81e6173ab7eb

       Output:

          {
              "NextLockToken": "12ebc73e-fa68-417d-a9b8-2bdd761a4fa5"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  IP Sets and Regex Pattern Sets in the AWS
       WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns this token to  your
          update requests. You use NextLockToken in the same manner as you use
          LockToken .
