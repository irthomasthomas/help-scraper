PUT-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSIONS()                PUT-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSIONS()



NAME
       put-managed-rule-set-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines  the versions of your managed rule set that you are offering to
       the customers. Customers see your offerings as managed rule groups with
       versioning.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

       Customers retrieve their managed rule group list by calling  ListAvail-
       ableManagedRuleGroups . The name that you provide here for your managed
       rule set is the name the customer sees for  the  corresponding  managed
       rule group. Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed
       rule group by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions . You pro-
       vide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule
       set, you must specify a version that you recommend using.

       To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group  version,  use   Up-
       dateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an App-
          Sync GraphQL API, a Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner  ser-
          vice.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in
          the responses to commands like list . You provide it  to  operations
          like get and update .

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.

       --recommended-version (string)
          The  version  of  the  named managed rule group that you'd like your
          customers to choose, from among your version offerings.

       --versions-to-publish (map)
          The versions of the named managed rule group that you want to  offer
          to your customers.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A version of the named managed rule group, that the rule group's
              vendor publishes for use by customers.

              NOTE:
                 This is intended for use only  by  vendors  of  managed  rule
                 sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services
                 Marketplace sellers.

                 Vendors, you can use the managed rule  set  APIs  to  provide
                 controlled  rollout  of your versioned managed rule group of-
                 ferings for your customers. The APIs are  ListManagedRuleSets
                 , GetManagedRuleSet , PutManagedRuleSetVersions , and Update-
                 ManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

              AssociatedRuleGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  vendor's  rule  group
                 that's used in the published managed rule group version.

              ForecastedLifetime -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  time  the vendor expects this version of the
                 managed rule group to last, in days.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=AssociatedRuleGroupArn=string,ForecastedLifetime=integer,KeyName2=AssociatedRuleGroupArn=string,ForecastedLifetime=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "AssociatedRuleGroupArn": "string",
                "ForecastedLifetime": integer
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
