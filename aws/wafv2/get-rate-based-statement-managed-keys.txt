NAME
       get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the keys that are currently blocked by a rate-based rule in-
       stance. The maximum number of managed keys that can be  blocked  for  a
       single  rate-based  rule  instance  is  10,000. If more than 10,000 ad-
       dresses exceed the  rate  limit,  those  with  the  highest  rates  are
       blocked.

       For  a rate-based rule that you've defined inside a rule group, provide
       the name of the rule group reference statement in your request, in  ad-
       dition to the rate-based rule name and the web ACL name.

       WAF  monitors  web  requests  and  manages  keys independently for each
       unique combination of web ACL,  optional  rule  group,  and  rate-based
       rule. For example, if you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group,
       and then use the rule group in a web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and
       manages  keys  for  that  web  ACL, rule group reference statement, and
       rate-based rule instance. If you use the same rule group  in  a  second
       web ACL, WAF monitors web requests and manages keys for this second us-
       age completely independent of your first.

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner ser-
          vice.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --web-acl-name (string)
          The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL af-
          ter you create it.

       --web-acl-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for the web ACL. This ID is returned in the
          responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --rule-group-rule-name (string)
          The name of the rule group reference statement in your web ACL. This
          is required only when you have the rate-based rule nested  inside  a
          rule group.

       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the rate-based rule to get the keys for. If you have the
          rule defined inside a rule group that you're using in your web  ACL,
          also  provide  the name of the rule group reference statement in the
          request parameter RuleGroupRuleName .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of IP addresses that are  blocked  by  a  rate-based
       rule

       The  following  get-rate-based-statement-managed-keys  retrieves the IP
       addresses currently blocked by a rate-based rule that's being used  for
       a regional application.
