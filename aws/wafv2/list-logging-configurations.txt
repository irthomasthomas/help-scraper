OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an  App  Runner  ser-
          vice, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of objects that you want WAF to return for this
          request. If more objects are available, in the  response,  WAF  pro-
          vides  a  NextMarker  value that you can use in a subsequent call to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --log-scope (string)
          The owner of the logging configuration, which must be  set  to  CUS-
          TOMER for the configurations that you manage.

          The  log  scope SECURITY_LAKE indicates a configuration that is man-
          aged through Amazon Security Lake. You can use Security Lake to col-
          lect  log  and  event  data  from various sources for normalization,
          analysis, and management. For information, see Collecting data  from
          Amazon  Web Services services in the Amazon Security Lake user guide
          .

          Default: CUSTOMER

          Possible values:

          o CUSTOMER

          o SECURITY_LAKE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of all logging configurations for a region

       The  following  list-logging-configurations  retrieves  the all logging
       configurations for web ACLs that are scoped for  regional  use  in  the
       us-west-2 region.

          aws wafv2 list-logging-configurations \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --region us-west-2

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          Array of logging configurations. If you specified a  Limit  in  your
          request, this might not be the full list.

          (structure)
              Defines  an  association  between logging destinations and a web
              ACL resource, for logging from WAF. As part of the  association,
              you can specify parts of the standard logging fields to keep out
              of the logs and you can specify filters so that you log  only  a
              subset of the logging records.

              NOTE:
                 You can define one logging destination per web ACL.

              You  can  access information about the traffic that WAF inspects
              using the following steps:

              o Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon  Cloud-
                Watch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
                S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.  The name that
                you  give  the destination must start with aws-waf-logs- . De-
                pending on the type of destination, you might need to  config-
                ure additional settings or permissions.  For configuration re-
                quirements and pricing information for each destination  type,
                see Logging web ACL traffic in the WAF Developer Guide .

              o Associate  your  logging  destination  to your web ACL using a
                PutLoggingConfiguration request.

              When you successfully enable logging using a  PutLoggingConfigu-
              ration request, WAF creates an additional role or policy that is
              required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon
              CloudWatch  Logs log group, WAF creates a resource policy on the
              log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, WAF creates a bucket policy.
              For  an  Amazon  Kinesis  Data  Firehose,  WAF  creates  a  ser-
              vice-linked role.

              For additional information about web ACL  logging,  see  Logging
              web ACL traffic information in the WAF Developer Guide .

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 The logging destination configuration that you want to  asso-
                 ciate with the web ACL.

                 NOTE:
                     You can associate one logging destination to a web ACL.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The  parts  of  the  request that you want to keep out of the
                 logs.

                 For example, if you redact the SingleHeader field, the HEADER
                 field in the logs will be REDACTED for all rules that use the
                 SingleHeader  FieldToMatch setting.

                 Redaction applies only to the component that's  specified  in
                 the  rule's  FieldToMatch setting, so the SingleHeader redac-
                 tion doesn't apply to rules  that  use  the  Headers   Field-
                 ToMatch .

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify only the following fields for redaction:
                     UriPath , QueryString , SingleHeader , and Method .

                 NOTE:
                     This setting has no impact on request sampling. With  re-
                     quest sampling, the only way to exclude fields is by dis-
                     abling sampling in the web ACL visibility configuration.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a web request component to be used  in  a  rule
                     match statement or in a logging configuration.

                     o In  a  rule  statement, this is the part of the web re-
                       quest that you want WAF to inspect. Include the  single
                       FieldToMatch  type that you want to inspect, with addi-
                       tional specifications as needed, according to the type.
                       You  specify a single request component in FieldToMatch
                       for each rule statement that requires  it.  To  inspect
                       more  than  one  component of the web request, create a
                       separate rule statement  for  each  component.  Example
                       JSON  for  a  QueryString  field  to  match:    "Field-
                       ToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }   Example  JSON  for  a
                       Method field to match specification:  "FieldToMatch": {
                       "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                     o In a logging configuration, this is used in the Redact-
                       edFields property to specify a field to redact from the
                       logging records. For this use case, note the following:

                       o Even though all FieldToMatch settings are  available,
                         the  only valid settings for field redaction are Uri-
                         Path , QueryString , SingleHeader , and Method .

                       o In this documentation, the descriptions of the  indi-
                         vidual  fields  talk about specifying the web request
                         component to inspect, but for  field  redaction,  you
                         are  specifying the component type to redact from the
                         logs.

                       o If you have request sampling  enabled,  the  redacted
                         fields  configuration  for  logging  has no impact on
                         sampling. The only way to exclude fields from request
                         sampling is by disabling sampling in the web ACL vis-
                         ibility configuration.

                     SingleHeader -> (structure)
                        Inspect a single  header.  Provide  the  name  of  the
                        header  to inspect, for example, User-Agent or Referer
                        . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                        Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }

                        Alternately, you can filter and  inspect  all  headers
                        with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query header to inspect.

                     SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                        Inspect  a  single query argument. Provide the name of
                        the query argument to inspect,  such  as  UserName  or
                        SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 characters long
                        and isn't case sensitive.

                        Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {   "Name":
                        "myArgument" }

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query argument to inspect.

                     AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                        Inspect all query arguments.

                     UriPath -> (structure)
                        Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part of the
                        web request that identifies a resource,  for  example,
                        /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     QueryString -> (structure)
                        Inspect  the  query  string. This is the part of a URL
                        that appears after a ? character, if any.

                     Body -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request body as plain  text.  The  request
                        body  immediately follows the request headers. This is
                        the part of a request  that  contains  any  additional
                        data  that  you want to send to your web server as the
                        HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                        WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of
                        the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for
                        the resource type. When a web request body  is  larger
                        than  the limit, the underlying host service only for-
                        wards the contents that are within the  limit  to  WAF
                        for inspection.

                        o For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit
                          is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

                        o For CloudFront, API  Gateway,  Amazon  Cognito,  App
                          Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16
                          KB (16,384 bytes), and you can  increase  the  limit
                          for  each  resource type in the web ACL Association-
                          Config , for additional processing fees.

                        For information about how to handle oversized  request
                        bodies, see the Body object configuration.

                        OversizeHandling -> (string)
                            What  WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF
                            can inspect.

                            WAF does not support inspecting  the  entire  con-
                            tents  of the web request body if the body exceeds
                            the limit for the resource type. When  a  web  re-
                            quest  body is larger than the limit, the underly-
                            ing host service only forwards the  contents  that
                            are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

                            o For  Application  Load Balancer and AppSync, the
                              limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

                            o For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App
                              Runner,  and  Verified Access, the default limit
                              is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and  you  can  increase
                              the  limit for each resource type in the web ACL
                              AssociationConfig ,  for  additional  processing
                              fees.

                            The  options for oversize handling are the follow-
                            ing:

                            o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body  contents
                              normally,  according to the rule inspection cri-
                              teria.

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                            You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings for
                            oversize handling with your rule and web  ACL  ac-
                            tion settings, so that you block any request whose
                            body is over the limit.

                            Default: CONTINUE

                     Method -> (structure)
                        Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type
                        of  operation that the request is asking the origin to
                        perform.

                     JsonBody -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body im-
                        mediately  follows  the  request  headers. This is the
                        part of a request that contains  any  additional  data
                        that  you  want to send to your web server as the HTTP
                        request body, such as data from a form.

                        WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of
                        the web request body if the body exceeds the limit for
                        the resource type. When a web request body  is  larger
                        than  the limit, the underlying host service only for-
                        wards the contents that are within the  limit  to  WAF
                        for inspection.

                        o For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit
                          is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

                        o For CloudFront, API  Gateway,  Amazon  Cognito,  App
                          Runner, and Verified Access, the default limit is 16
                          KB (16,384 bytes), and you can  increase  the  limit
                          for  each  resource type in the web ACL Association-
                          Config , for additional processing fees.

                        For information about how to handle oversized  request
                        bodies, see the JsonBody object configuration.

                        MatchPattern -> (structure)
                            The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF in-
                            spects  the  results  of  these  pattern   matches
                            against the rule inspection criteria.

                            All -> (structure)
                               Match  all of the elements. See also MatchScope
                               in  JsonBody .

                               You must specify either this setting or the In-
                               cludedPaths setting, but not both.

                            IncludedPaths -> (list)
                               Match  only  the  specified  include paths. See
                               also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                               Provide the include paths  using  JSON  Pointer
                               syntax.     For    example,    "IncludedPaths":
                               ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] . For informa-
                               tion  about this syntax, see the Internet Engi-
                               neering   Task   Force   (IETF)   documentation
                               JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                               You must specify either this setting or the All
                               setting, but not both.

                               NOTE:
                                   Don't use this option to include all paths.
                                   Instead, use the All setting.

                               (string)

                        MatchScope -> (string)
                            The  parts  of the JSON to match against using the
                            MatchPattern . If you specify ALL  ,  WAF  matches
                            against keys and values.
                               All does not require a match to be found in the
                               keys and a match to be found in the values.  It
                               requires a match to be found in the keys or the
                               values or both. To require a match in the  keys
                               and  in the values, use a logical AND statement
                               to combine two match rules, one  that  inspects
                               the keys and another that inspects the values.

                        InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse
                            the JSON body. The options are the following:

                            o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as  plain
                              text.  WAF  applies the text transformations and
                              inspection criteria that  you  defined  for  the
                              JSON inspection to the body text string.

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                            If you don't provide this setting, WAF parses  and
                            evaluates the content only up to the first parsing
                            failure that it encounters.

                            NOTE:
                               WAF parsing doesn't fully  validate  the  input
                               JSON  string,  so  parsing can succeed even for
                               invalid  JSON.  When  parsing   succeeds,   WAF
                               doesn't  apply  the fallback behavior. For more
                               information, see JSON body in the WAF Developer
                               Guide .

                        OversizeHandling -> (string)
                            What  WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF
                            can inspect.

                            WAF does not support inspecting  the  entire  con-
                            tents  of the web request body if the body exceeds
                            the limit for the resource type. When  a  web  re-
                            quest  body is larger than the limit, the underly-
                            ing host service only forwards the  contents  that
                            are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

                            o For  Application  Load Balancer and AppSync, the
                              limit is fixed at 8 KB (8,192 bytes).

                            o For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App
                              Runner,  and  Verified Access, the default limit
                              is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and  you  can  increase
                              the  limit for each resource type in the web ACL
                              AssociationConfig ,  for  additional  processing
                              fees.

                            The  options for oversize handling are the follow-
                            ing:

                            o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  body  contents
                              normally,  according to the rule inspection cri-
                              teria.

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                            You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH settings for
                            oversize handling with your rule and web  ACL  ac-
                            tion settings, so that you block any request whose
                            body is over the limit.

                            Default: CONTINUE

                     Headers -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request headers. You must configure  scope
                        and pattern matching filters in the Headers object, to
                        define the set of headers to  and  the  parts  of  the
                        headers that WAF inspects.

                        Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's head-
                        ers and only the first 200 headers  are  forwarded  to
                        WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You
                        must configure how to handle any oversize header  con-
                        tent  in  the  Headers object. WAF applies the pattern
                        matching filters to the headers that it receives  from
                        the underlying host service.

                        MatchPattern -> (structure)
                            The  filter to use to identify the subset of head-
                            ers to inspect in a web request.

                            You must specify exactly one setting: either All ,
                            IncludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                            Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders":
                            [ "KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                            All -> (structure)
                               Inspect all headers.

                            IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                               Inspect only the headers that have a  key  that
                               matches one of the strings specified here.

                               (string)

                            ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                               Inspect only the headers whose keys don't match
                               any of the strings specified here.

                               (string)

                        MatchScope -> (string)
                            The parts of the headers to match  with  the  rule
                            inspection  criteria. If you specify ALL , WAF in-
                            spects both keys and values.
                               All does not require a match to be found in the
                               keys  and a match to be found in the values. It
                               requires a match to be found in the keys or the
                               values  or both. To require a match in the keys
                               and in the values, use a logical AND  statement
                               to  combine  two match rules, one that inspects
                               the keys and another that inspects the values.

                        OversizeHandling -> (string)
                            What WAF should do if the headers of  the  request
                            are  more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect.
                            WAF does not support inspecting  the  entire  con-
                            tents  of  request  headers  when they exceed 8 KB
                            (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers. The  underlying
                            host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and
                            at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                            The options for oversize handling are the  follow-
                            ing:

                            o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available headers nor-
                              mally, according to the rule  inspection  crite-
                              ria.

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                     Cookies -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request cookies. You must configure  scope
                        and pattern matching filters in the Cookies object, to
                        define the set of cookies and the parts of the cookies
                        that WAF inspects.

                        Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's cook-
                        ies and only the first 200 cookies  are  forwarded  to
                        WAF for inspection by the underlying host service. You
                        must configure how to handle any oversize cookie  con-
                        tent  in  the  Cookies object. WAF applies the pattern
                        matching filters to the cookies that it receives  from
                        the underlying host service.

                        MatchPattern -> (structure)
                            The  filter to use to identify the subset of cook-
                            ies to inspect in a web request.

                            You must specify exactly one setting: either All ,
                            IncludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                            Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "IncludedCookies":
                            [ "session-id-time", "session-id" ] }

                            All -> (structure)
                               Inspect all cookies.

                            IncludedCookies -> (list)
                               Inspect only the cookies that have a  key  that
                               matches one of the strings specified here.

                               (string)

                            ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                               Inspect only the cookies whose keys don't match
                               any of the strings specified here.

                               (string)

                        MatchScope -> (string)
                            The parts of the cookies to inspect with the  rule
                            inspection  criteria. If you specify ALL , WAF in-
                            spects both keys and values.
                               All does not require a match to be found in the
                               keys  and a match to be found in the values. It
                               requires a match to be found in the keys or the
                               values  or both. To require a match in the keys
                               and in the values, use a logical AND  statement
                               to  combine  two match rules, one that inspects
                               the keys and another that inspects the values.

                        OversizeHandling -> (string)
                            What WAF should do if the cookies of  the  request
                            are  more numerous or larger than WAF can inspect.
                            WAF does not support inspecting  the  entire  con-
                            tents  of  request  cookies  when they exceed 8 KB
                            (8192 bytes) or 200 total cookies. The  underlying
                            host service forwards a maximum of 200 cookies and
                            at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                            The options for oversize handling are the  follow-
                            ing:

                            o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the available cookies nor-
                              mally, according to the rule  inspection  crite-
                              ria.

                            o MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as matching the
                              rule statement. WAF applies the rule  action  to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                     HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                        Inspect a string containing the list of the  request's
                        header  names,  ordered  as they appear in the web re-
                        quest that WAF receives for inspection. WAF  generates
                        the  string  and  then uses that as the field to match
                        component in its inspection. WAF separates the  header
                        names  in the string using colons and no added spaces,
                        for example  host:user-agent:accept:authorization:ref-
                        erer .

                        OversizeHandling -> (string)
                            What  WAF  should do if the headers of the request
                            are more numerous or larger than WAF can  inspect.
                            WAF  does  not  support inspecting the entire con-
                            tents of request headers when  they  exceed  8  KB
                            (8192  bytes) or 200 total headers. The underlying
                            host service forwards a maximum of 200 headers and
                            at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                            The  options for oversize handling are the follow-
                            ing:

                            o CONTINUE - Inspect the  available  headers  nor-
                              mally,  according  to the rule inspection crite-
                              ria.

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                     JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                        Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions
                        and Application Load Balancers. Match against the  re-
                        quest's  JA3  fingerprint.  The  JA3  fingerprint is a
                        32-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of
                        an  incoming  request.  This  fingerprint  serves as a
                        unique identifier for the client's TLS  configuration.
                        WAF  calculates and logs this fingerprint for each re-
                        quest that has enough TLS Client Hello information for
                        the  calculation. Almost all web requests include this
                        information.

                        NOTE:
                            You can use this choice only with a  string  match
                            ByteMatchStatement  with  the PositionalConstraint
                            set to EXACTLY .

                        You can obtain the JA3 fingerprint for client requests
                        from the web ACL logs. If WAF is able to calculate the
                        fingerprint, it includes it in the logs. For  informa-
                        tion  about  the logging fields, see Log fields in the
                        WAF Developer Guide .

                        Provide the JA3 fingerprint string from  the  logs  in
                        your  string  match  statement specification, to match
                        with any future requests that have the same  TLS  con-
                        figuration.

                        FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            The  match  status to assign to the web request if
                            the request doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                            You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

              ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  logging configuration was created by
                 Firewall Manager, as part of an WAF policy configuration.  If
                 true, only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configu-
                 ration.

                 The logging configuration can be created by Firewall  Manager
                 for  use  with any web ACL that Firewall Manager is using for
                 an WAF policy. Web ACLs that  Firewall  Manager  creates  and
                 uses  have  their  ManagedByFirewallManager  property  set to
                 true. Web ACLs that were created by a  customer  account  and
                 then retrofitted by Firewall Manager for use by a policy have
                 their RetrofittedByFirewallManager property set to true.  For
                 either case, any corresponding logging configuration will in-
                 dicate ManagedByFirewallManager .

              LoggingFilter -> (structure)
                 Filtering that specifies which web requests are kept  in  the
                 logs and which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action
                 and on the web request labels that were applied  by  matching
                 rules during web ACL evaluation.

                 Filters -> (list)
                     The filters that you want to apply to the logs.

                     (structure)
                        A single logging filter, used in  LoggingFilter .

                        Behavior -> (string)
                            How  to handle logs that satisfy the filter's con-
                            ditions and requirement.

                        Requirement -> (string)
                            Logic to apply to the  filtering  conditions.  You
                            can  specify that, in order to satisfy the filter,
                            a log must match all conditions or must  match  at
                            least one condition.

                        Conditions -> (list)
                            Match conditions for the filter.

                            (structure)
                               A single match condition for a  Filter .

                               ActionCondition -> (structure)
                                   A  single action condition. This is the ac-
                                   tion setting that a log record must contain
                                   in order to meet the condition.

                                   Action -> (string)
                                      The  action  setting  that  a log record
                                      must contain in order to meet the condi-
                                      tion.  This  is  the action that WAF ap-
                                      plied to the web request.

                                      For rule groups, this is either the con-
                                      figured   rule  action  setting,  or  if
                                      you've applied a rule action override to
                                      the  rule, it's the override action. The
                                      value EXCLUDED_AS_COUNT matches  on  ex-
                                      cluded rules and also on rules that have
                                      a rule action override of Count.

                               LabelNameCondition -> (structure)
                                   A single label name condition. This is  the
                                   fully  qualified  label  name  that  a  log
                                   record must contain in order  to  meet  the
                                   condition.  Fully  qualified  labels have a
                                   prefix,  optional  namespaces,  and   label
                                   name.  The prefix identifies the rule group
                                   or web ACL context of the rule  that  added
                                   the label.

                                   LabelName -> (string)
                                      The  label  name  that a log record must
                                      contain in order to meet the  condition.
                                      This  must  be  a  fully qualified label
                                      name. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                                      fix,   optional  namespaces,  and  label
                                      name. The  prefix  identifies  the  rule
                                      group  or  web  ACL  context of the rule
                                      that added the label.

                 DefaultBehavior -> (string)
                     Default handling for logs that don't  match  any  of  the
                     specified filtering conditions.

              LogType -> (string)
                 Used  to  distinguish  between  various logging options. Cur-
                 rently, there is one option.

                 Default: WAF_LOGS

              LogScope -> (string)
                 The owner of the logging configuration, which must be set  to
                 CUSTOMER for the configurations that you manage.

                 The log scope SECURITY_LAKE indicates a configuration that is
                 managed through Amazon Security Lake. You  can  use  Security
                 Lake  to  collect log and event data from various sources for
                 normalization, analysis, and management. For information, see
                 Collecting data from Amazon Web Services services in the Ama-
                 zon Security Lake user guide .

                 Default: CUSTOMER

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.
