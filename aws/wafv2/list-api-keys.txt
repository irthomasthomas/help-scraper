OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner ser-
          vice.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       APIKeySummaries -> (list)
          The array of key summaries. If you specified a  Limit  in  your  re-
          quest, this might not be the full list.

          (structure)
              Information for a single API key.

              TokenDomains -> (list)
                 The token domains that are defined in this API key.

                 (string)

              APIKey -> (string)
                 The  generated,  encrypted API key. You can copy this for use
                 in your JavaScript CAPTCHA integration.

                 Script integration, see WAF client application integration in
                 the WAF Developer Guide .

              CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the key was created.

              Version -> (integer)
                 Internal value used by WAF to manage the key.

       ApplicationIntegrationURL -> (string)
          The CAPTCHA application integration URL, for use in your  JavaScript
          implementation.

          tegration, see WAF client application integration in the WAF  Devel-
