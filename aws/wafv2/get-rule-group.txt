OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule
          group after you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync  GraphQL  API,  an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner ser-
          vice, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned  in  the
          responses  to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
          like update and delete.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a specific custom rule group

       The following get-rule-group retrieves the custom rule group  with  the
       specified name, scope, and ID. You can get the ID for a rule group from
       the commands create-rule-group and list-rule-groups.

          aws wafv2 get-rule-group \
              --name ff \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

OUTPUT
       RuleGroup -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule
              group after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is  returned  in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Capacity -> (long)
              The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

              When you create your own rule group, you define  this,  and  you
              cannot  change  it  after  creation.  When you add or modify the
              rules in a rule group, WAF enforces this limit.  You  can  check
              the capacity for a set of rules using  CheckCapacity .

              WAF  uses  WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources
              that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs.  WAF
              calculates  capacity  differently for each rule type, to reflect
              the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to
              run  use  fewer  WCUs than more complex rules that use more pro-
              cessing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at  creation,  which
              helps  users  plan  their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule
              group. For more information, see  WAF  web  ACL  capacity  units
              (WCU) in the WAF Developer Guide .

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group that helps with identification.

          Rules -> (list)
              The   Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you
              want to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement  that
              WAF  uses to identify matching web requests, and parameters that
              govern how WAF handles them.

              (structure)
                 A single rule, which you can use in a  WebACL  or   RuleGroup
                 to identify web requests that you want to manage in some way.
                 Each rule includes one top-level  Statement that WAF uses  to
                 identify  matching  web  requests, and parameters that govern
                 how WAF handles them.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the rule.

                     If you change the name of a Rule after you create it  and
                     you  want  the  rule's metric name to reflect the change,
                     update the metric name  in  the  rule's  VisibilityConfig
                     settings.  WAF  doesn't  automatically  update the metric
                     name when you update the rule name.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL , WAF evalu-
                     ates each request against the Rules in order based on the
                     value of Priority . WAF processes rules with lower prior-
                     ity  first.  The priorities don't need to be consecutive,
                     but they must all be different.

                 Statement -> (structure)
                     The WAF processing statement for the  rule,  for  example
                     ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

                     ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that defines a string match search
                        for WAF to apply  to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                        statement  provides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                        tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to  search,  and
                        other  settings. The bytes to search for are typically
                        a string that corresponds with  ASCII  characters.  In
                        the  WAF  console  and  the  developer  guide, this is
                        called a string match statement.

                        SearchString -> (blob)
                            A string value that you want WAF  to  search  for.
                            WAF searches only in the part of web requests that
                            you designate for inspection  in   FieldToMatch  .
                            The maximum length of the value is 200 bytes.

                            Valid  values  depend  on  the  component that you
                            specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                            o Method : The HTTP method that you  want  WAF  to
                              search for. This indicates the type of operation
                              specified in the request.

                            o UriPath : The value that you want WAF to  search
                              for   in   the   URI  path,  for  example,  /im-
                              ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                            o JA3Fingerprint : The string to match against the
                              web request's JA3 fingerprint header. The header
                              contains a hash fingerprint of  the  TLS  Client
                              Hello packet for the request.

                            o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list of header
                              names to match for. WAF creates  a  string  that
                              contains  the ordered list of header names, from
                              the headers in the web request, and then matches
                              against that string.

                            If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z
                            and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                               If you're using the WAF API

                            Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The
                            maximum  length of the value before you base64-en-
                            code it is 200 bytes.

                            For example, suppose the value of Type  is  HEADER
                            and  the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want
                            to search the User-Agent header for the value Bad-
                            Bot   ,   you   base64-encode  BadBot  using  MIME
                            base64-encoding and include the  resulting  value,
                            QmFkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                               If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the Amazon
                               Web Services SDKs

                            The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK
                            automatically base64 encodes the value.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately,  you  can  filter  and inspect all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  the web request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the Body object  configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force
                                      (IETF) documentation  JavaScript  Object
                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's

                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-

                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure

                            HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                               Inspect a string containing the list of the re-
                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in

                               tion.  WAF  generates  the string and then uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the
                               string using colons and no  added  spaces,  for
                               example       host:user-agent:accept:authoriza-

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match  against  the  request's  JA3 fingerprint
                               header. The header contains a hash  fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You  can use this choice only with a string

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort  to  bypass detection. Text transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting it, and they're used in  rate-based  rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using them as  custom  aggregation  keys.  If  you
                            specify  one or more transformations to apply, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent,  starting  from the lowest priority setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)

                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                                   transformations, from  lowest  priority  to
                                   highest,  before inspecting the transformed
                                   content. The priorities don't  need  to  be
                                   consecutive,  but  they must all be differ-
                                   ent.

                            The area within the portion  of  the  web  request
                            that  you  want  WAF  to search for SearchString .
                            Valid values include the following:
                               CONTAINS

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the  value  of  SearchString  ,  but  the location
                            doesn't matter.
                               CONTAINS_WORD

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the  value of SearchString , and SearchString must
                            contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore
                            (A-Z,  a-z,  0-9, or _). In addition, SearchString
                            must be a word, which means that both of the  fol-
                            lowing are true:

                            o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the speci-
                              fied part of the web request or is preceded by a
                              character  other  than an alphanumeric character
                              or underscore (_). Examples include the value of
                              a header and ;BadBot .

                            o SearchString is at the end of the specified part
                              of the web request or is followed by a character
                              other  than  an alphanumeric character or under-
                              score (_), for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                               EXACTLY

                            The value of the specified part of the web request
                            must exactly match the value of SearchString .
                               STARTS_WITH

                            The  value  of SearchString must appear at the be-
                            ginning of the specified part of the web request.
                               ENDS_WITH

                            The value of SearchString must appear at  the  end
                            of the specified part of the web request.

                     SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code.
                        Attackers insert malicious SQL code into web  requests
                        to do things like modify your database or extract data
                        from it.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of the web request that you want  WAF  to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately, you can  filter  and  inspect  all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide the
                               name of the query argument to inspect, such  as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": {  "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of the web request that identifies a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A  limited  amount  of the request body is for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).
                               For CloudFront distributions, you can  increase
                               the  limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For information about how to  handle  oversized
                               request  bodies, see the Body object configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  body  is  larger
                                   than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not support
                                   inspecting the entire contents of  the  web
                                   request  body if the body exceeds the limit
                                   for the  resource  type.  If  the  body  is
                                   larger  than the limit, the underlying host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for  CloudFront  distributions.  For Cloud-
                                   Front distributions, you can  increase  the
                                   limit  in  the  web ACL AssociationConfig ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  available body
                                     contents normally, according to the  rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  set-
                                   tings  for oversize handling with your rule
                                   and web ACL action settings,  so  that  you
                                   block  any  request  whose body is over the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               A  limited  amount  of the request body is for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).
                               For CloudFront distributions, you can  increase
                               the  limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For information about how to  handle  oversized
                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match  only the specified include paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide the  include  paths  using  JSON
                                      Pointer  syntax. For example, "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the  Internet  Engineering  Task   Force
                                      (IETF)  documentation  JavaScript Object
                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the JSON to match against  us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  body  is  larger
                                   than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not support
                                   inspecting the entire contents of  the  web
                                   request  body if the body exceeds the limit
                                   for the  resource  type.  If  the  body  is
                                   larger  than the limit, the underlying host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for  CloudFront  distributions.  For Cloud-
                                   Front distributions, you can  increase  the
                                   limit  in  the  web ACL AssociationConfig ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  available body
                                     contents normally, according to the  rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  set-
                                   tings  for oversize handling with your rule
                                   and web ACL action settings,  so  that  you
                                   block  any  request  whose body is over the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               headers and only the first 200 headers are for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. You must configure how to  handle
                               any  oversize header content in the Headers ob-
                               ject. WAF applies the pattern matching  filters
                               to the headers that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   headers to inspect in a web request.

                                   You  must  specify exactly one setting: ei-
                                   ther All , IncludedHeaders ,  or  Excluded-
                                   Headers .

                                   Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Excluded-
                                   Headers":  [   "KeyToExclude1",   "KeyToEx-
                                   clude2" ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all headers.

                                   IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the headers that have a key
                                      that matches one of the  strings  speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  headers  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the headers to match with the
                                   rule inspection criteria.  If  you  specify
                                   All , WAF inspects both keys and values.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   headers  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total headers. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available headers
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Cook-
                               ies object, to define the set  of  cookies  and
                               the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's

                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in
                               the  web  request that WAF receives for inspec-
                               tion. WAF generates the string  and  then  uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the

                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match against  the  request's  JA3  fingerprint
                               header.  The header contains a hash fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You can use this choice only with a  string
                                   match ByteMatchStatement with the Position-
                                   alConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the  request  doesn't have a JA3
                                   fingerprint.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass  detection.  Text  transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting  it,  and they're used in rate-based rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using  them  as  custom  aggregation  keys. If you
                            specify one or more transformations to apply,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent, starting from the lowest  priority  setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations.  WAF  processes  all
                                   transformations,  from  lowest  priority to
                                   highest, before inspecting the  transformed
                                   content.  The  priorities  don't need to be
                                   consecutive, but they must all  be  differ-
                                   ent.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   For  detailed  descriptions  of each of the
                                   transformation types, see Text  transforma-
                                   tions in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                            The  sensitivity  that  you want WAF to use to in-
                            spect for SQL injection attacks.
                               HIGH detects more attacks, but  might  generate
                               more  false  positives,  especially if your web
                               requests frequently  contain  unusual  strings.
                               For  information about identifying and mitigat-
                               ing false positives, see Testing and tuning  in
                               the WAF Developer Guide .

                               LOW  is generally a better choice for resources
                               that already have other protections against SQL
                               injection  attacks or that have a low tolerance
                               for false positives.

                            Default: LOW

                     XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement that inspects for cross-site  script-
                        ing  (XSS)  attacks. In XSS attacks, the attacker uses
                        vulnerabilities in a benign website as  a  vehicle  to
                        inject malicious client-site scripts into other legit-
                        imate web browsers.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of the web request that you want  WAF  to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately, you can  filter  and  inspect  all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide the
                               name of the query argument to inspect, such  as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": {  "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of the web request that identifies a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A  limited  amount  of the request body is for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).
                               For CloudFront distributions, you can  increase
                               the  limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For information about how to  handle  oversized
                               request  bodies, see the Body object configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  body  is  larger
                                   than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not support
                                   inspecting the entire contents of  the  web
                                   request  body if the body exceeds the limit
                                   for the  resource  type.  If  the  body  is
                                   larger  than the limit, the underlying host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for  CloudFront  distributions.  For Cloud-
                                   Front distributions, you can  increase  the
                                   limit  in  the  web ACL AssociationConfig ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  available body
                                     contents normally, according to the  rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  set-
                                   tings  for oversize handling with your rule
                                   and web ACL action settings,  so  that  you
                                   block  any  request  whose body is over the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               A  limited  amount  of the request body is for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront  dis-
                               tributions,  the limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes).
                               For CloudFront distributions, you can  increase
                               the  limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For information about how to  handle  oversized
                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match  only the specified include paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide the  include  paths  using  JSON
                                      Pointer  syntax. For example, "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the  Internet  Engineering  Task   Force

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the JSON to match against  us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  body  is  larger
                                   than  WAF can inspect. WAF does not support
                                   inspecting the entire contents of  the  web
                                   request  body if the body exceeds the limit
                                   for the  resource  type.  If  the  body  is
                                   larger  than the limit, the underlying host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for  CloudFront  distributions.  For Cloud-
                                   Front distributions, you can  increase  the
                                   limit  in  the  web ACL AssociationConfig ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  -  Inspect  the  available body
                                     contents normally, according to the  rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH  set-
                                   tings  for oversize handling with your rule
                                   and web ACL action settings,  so  that  you
                                   block  any  request  whose body is over the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               headers and only the first 200 headers are for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. You must configure how to  handle
                               any  oversize header content in the Headers ob-
                               ject. WAF applies the pattern matching  filters
                               to the headers that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   headers to inspect in a web request.

                                   You  must  specify exactly one setting: ei-
                                   ther All , IncludedHeaders ,  or  Excluded-
                                   Headers .

                                   Example  JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Excluded-
                                   Headers":  [   "KeyToExclude1",   "KeyToEx-
                                   clude2" ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all headers.

                                   IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the headers that have a key
                                      that matches one of the  strings  speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  headers  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the headers to match with the
                                   rule inspection criteria.  If  you  specify
                                   All , WAF inspects both keys and values.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   headers  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total headers. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available headers
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Cook-
                               ies object, to define the set  of  cookies  and
                               the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               cookies and only the first 200 cookies are for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. You must configure how to  handle
                               any  oversize cookie content in the Cookies ob-
                               ject. WAF applies the pattern matching  filters
                               to the cookies that it receives from the under-

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                   You  must  specify exactly one setting: ei-

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all cookies.

                                   IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the cookies that have a key
                                      that matches one of the  strings  speci-

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  cookies  of  the

                                   cookies when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total cookies. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  cookies
                                   and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  cookies
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                               Inspect a string containing the list of the re-
                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in
                               the  web  request that WAF receives for inspec-
                               tion. WAF generates the string  and  then  uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the
                               string  using  colons  and no added spaces, for
                               example       host:user-agent:accept:authoriza-
                               tion:referer .

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the headers of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   headers  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total headers. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available headers
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match against  the  request's  JA3  fingerprint
                               header.  The header contains a hash fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You can use this choice only with a  string
                                   match ByteMatchStatement with the Position-
                                   alConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The match status to assign to the  web  re-
                                   quest  if  the  request  doesn't have a JA3
                                   fingerprint.

                                   You can specify the following fallback  be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass  detection.  Text  transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting  it,  and they're used in rate-based rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using  them  as  custom  aggregation  keys. If you
                            specify one or more transformations to apply,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent, starting from the lowest  priority  setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations.  WAF  processes  all
                                   transformations,  from  lowest  priority to
                                   highest, before inspecting the  transformed
                                   content.  The  priorities  don't need to be
                                   consecutive, but they must all  be  differ-
                                   ent.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   For  detailed  descriptions  of each of the
                                   transformation types, see Text  transforma-
                                   tions in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that  compares  a  number of bytes
                        against the size of a request component, using a  com-
                        parison  operator,  such  as  greater than (>) or less
                        than (<). For example, you can use a  size  constraint
                        statement  to  look  for query strings that are longer
                        than 100 bytes.

                        If you configure WAF to inspect the request body,  WAF
                        inspects  only  the  number of bytes of the body up to
                        the limit for the web ACL. By  default,  for  regional
                        web  ACLs,  this  limit  is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for
                        CloudFront web ACLs,  this  limit  is  16  KB  (16,384
                        bytes).  For CloudFront web ACLs, you can increase the
                        limit in the web ACL  AssociationConfig  ,  for  addi-
                        tional  fees.  If  you  know that the request body for
                        your web requests should never exceed  the  inspection
                        limit,  you  could  use a size constraint statement to
                        block requests that have a larger request body size.

                        If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request
                        to  filter  on, the slash (/) in the URI counts as one
                        character. For example,  the  URI  /logo.jpg  is  nine
                        characters long.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately,  you  can  filter  and inspect all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  the web request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the Body object  configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               headers and only the first 200 headers are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize header content in the Headers  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the headers that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   headers to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-
                                   ther  All  , IncludedHeaders , or Excluded-
                                   Headers .

                                   Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "Excluded-
                                   Headers":   [   "KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                   clude2" ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all headers.

                                   IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the headers that have a key
                                      that  matches  one of the strings speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  headers  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the headers to match with  the
                                   rule  inspection  criteria.  If you specify
                                   All , WAF inspects both keys and values.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Cook-
                               ies  object,  to  define the set of cookies and
                               the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               cookies and only the first 200 cookies are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize cookie content in the Cookies  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the cookies that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-
                                   ther  All  , IncludedCookies , or Excluded-
                                   Cookies .

                                   Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "Included-
                                   Cookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id"
                                   ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all cookies.

                                   IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the cookies that have a key
                                      that  matches  one of the strings speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  cookies  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the cookies  to  inspect  with
                                   the  rule inspection criteria. If you spec-
                                   ify All , WAF inspects both keys  and  val-
                                   ues.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   cookies  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total cookies. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 cookies
                                   and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available cookies
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                               Inspect a string containing the list of the re-
                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in
                               the web request that WAF receives  for  inspec-
                               tion.  WAF  generates  the string and then uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the
                               string using colons and no  added  spaces,  for
                               example       host:user-agent:accept:authoriza-
                               tion:referer .

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match  against  the  request's  JA3 fingerprint
                               header. The header contains a hash  fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You  can use this choice only with a string
                                   match ByteMatchStatement with the Position-
                                   alConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request  doesn't  have  a  JA3
                                   fingerprint.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                            The operator to use to compare the request part to
                            the size setting.

                        Size -> (long)
                            The size, in byte, to compare to the request part,
                            after any transformations.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort  to  bypass detection. Text transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting it, and they're used in  rate-based  rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using them as  custom  aggregation  keys.  If  you
                            specify  one or more transformations to apply, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent,  starting  from the lowest priority setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations.  WAF  processes all
                                   transformations, from  lowest  priority  to
                                   highest,  before inspecting the transformed
                                   content. The priorities don't  need  to  be
                                   consecutive,  but  they must all be differ-
                                   ent.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   For detailed descriptions of  each  of  the
                                   transformation  types, see Text transforma-
                                   tions in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement that labels web requests  by  country
                        and region and that matches against web requests based
                        on country code. A geo match rule labels every request
                        that  it  inspects  regardless  of  whether it finds a
                        match.

                        o To manage requests only by country, you can use this
                          statement  by  itself and specify the countries that
                          you want to match against in the CountryCodes array.

                        o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with  Count
                          action  so  that  it only labels requests. Then, add
                          one or more label match rules to run after  the  geo
                          match  rule  and configure them to match against the
                          geographic labels and handle the requests as needed.

                        WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 country and  re-
                        gion  codes  from  the  International Organization for
                        Standardization (ISO) 3166  standard.  WAF  determines
                        the  codes  using either the IP address in the web re-
                        quest origin or, if you specify it, the address in the
                        geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                        If  you  use the web request origin, the label formats
                        are awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO country code>-<ISO
                        region   code>   and  awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO
                        country code> .

                        If you use a forwarded IP address, the  label  formats
                        are     awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO     country
                        code>-<ISO    region     code>     and     awswaf:for-
                        wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                        For  additional  details,  see  Geographic  match rule
                        statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        CountryCodes -> (list)
                            An array of two-character country codes  that  you
                            want to match against, for example, [ "US", "CN" ]
                            , from the alpha-2 country ISO codes  of  the  ISO
                            3166 international standard.

                            When  you  use  a geo match statement just for the
                            region and country labels  that  it  adds  to  re-
                            quests,  you  still  have to supply a country code
                            for the rule to evaluate. In this case,  you  con-
                            figure  the  rule to only count matching requests,
                            but it will still generate logging and count  met-
                            rics  for  any matches. You can reduce the logging
                            and metrics that the rule produces by specifying a
                            country  that's unlikely to be a source of traffic
                            to your site.

                            (string)

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in
                            an  HTTP header that you specify, instead of using
                            the IP address that's reported by the web  request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the

                               address.   For   example,  to  use  the  X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header,  set  this  to  X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a valid IP  address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You  can  specify the following fallback behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  used to run the rules that are de-
                        fined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,  create  a  rule
                        group  with  your  rules,  then provide the ARN of the
                        rule group in this statement.

                        You cannot nest a  RuleGroupReferenceStatement  ,  for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You cannot use a rule group reference statement inside
                        another  rule  group.  You  can  only reference a rule
                        group as a top-level statement within a rule that  you
                        define in a web ACL.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            Rules  in  the referenced rule group whose actions
                            are set to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               .  It accepts any valid action setting, includ-
                               ing Count .

                            (structure)
                               Specifies a single rule in a rule  group  whose
                               action you want to override to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides . It accepts any  valid  action  set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                            Action settings to use in the place  of  the  rule
                            actions that are configured inside the rule group.
                            You specify one override for each rule  whose  ac-
                            tion you want to change.

                            You can use overrides for testing, for example you
                            can override all of rule actions to Count and then
                            monitor  the resulting count metrics to understand
                            how the rule group would handle your web  traffic.
                            You  can also permanently override some or all ac-
                            tions, to modify how the rule group  manages  your
                            web traffic.

                            (structure)

                               group.  You  specify one override for each rule
                               whose action you want to change.

                               You can use overrides for testing, for  example
                               you  can  override all of rule actions to Count
                               and then monitor the resulting count metrics to
                               understand how the rule group would handle your
                               web traffic. You can also permanently  override
                               some  or  all  actions,  to modify how the rule
                               group manages your web traffic.

                                   configured  action  of the rule in the rule
                                   group.

                                   Block -> (structure)

                                                    serts the header into  the
                                                    request,  it prefixes this
                                                    name  x-amzn-waf-   ,   to
                                                    avoid  confusion  with the
                                                    headers that  are  already
                                                    in  the request. For exam-
                                                    ple, for the  header  name
                                                    sample  ,  WAF inserts the
                                                    header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                 Value -> (string)
                                                    The value  of  the  custom
                                                    header.

                     IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests coming
                        from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use
                        this,  create  an   IPSet that specifies the addresses
                        you want to detect, then use the ARN of  that  set  in
                        this  statement. To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet
                        .

                        Each IP set rule statement references an IP  set.  You
                        create and maintain the set independent of your rules.
                        This allows you to use  the  single  set  in  multiple
                        rules.  When  you update the referenced set, WAF auto-
                        matically updates all rules that reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet  that
                            this statement references.

                        IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses in
                            an HTTP header that you specify, instead of  using
                            the  IP address that's reported by the web request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the HTTP header to use for the IP
                               address.  For  example,  to  use   the   X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  set  this to X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The match status to assign to the  web  request
                               if  the request doesn't have a valid IP address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                            Position -> (string)
                               The position in the header to search for the IP
                               address. The header can contain IP addresses of
                               the original client and also  of  proxies.  For
                               example,  the  header  value could be 10.1.1.1,
                               127.0.0.0, 10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  ad-
                               dress  identifies  the  original client and the
                               rest identify proxies  that  the  request  went
                               through.

                               The options for this setting are the following:

                               o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address in the
                                 list of IP addresses in the header.  This  is
                                 usually the client's original IP.

                               o LAST  -  Inspect  the  last IP address in the
                                 list of IP addresses in the header.

                               o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in the  header
                                 for a match. If the header contains more than
                                 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

                     RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for  matches  with  regular  expressions. To use this,
                        create a  RegexPatternSet that specifies  the  expres-
                        sions  that  you  want  to detect, then use the ARN of
                        that set in this statement. A web request matches  the
                        pattern  set  rule  statement if the request component
                        matches any of the patterns in the set.  To  create  a
                        regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                        Each  regex  pattern  set  rule statement references a
                        regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set in-
                        dependent  of  your  rules. This allows you to use the
                        single set in multiple rules. When you update the ref-
                        erenced  set, WAF automatically updates all rules that
                        reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the   RegexPat-
                            ternSet that this statement references.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately,  you  can  filter  and inspect all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  the web request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the Body object  configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force
                                      (IETF) documentation  JavaScript  Object
                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               headers and only the first 200 headers are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize header content in the Headers  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the headers that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   headers to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-
                                   ther  All  , IncludedHeaders , or Excluded-
                                   Headers .

                                   Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "Excluded-
                                   Headers":   [   "KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                   clude2" ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all headers.

                                   IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the headers that have a key
                                      that  matches  one of the strings speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  headers  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the headers to match with  the
                                   rule  inspection  criteria.  If you specify
                                   All , WAF inspects both keys and values.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Cook-
                               ies  object,  to  define the set of cookies and
                               the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               cookies and only the first 200 cookies are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize cookie content in the Cookies  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the cookies that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   cookies  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total cookies. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 cookies
                                   and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available cookies
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                               Inspect a string containing the list of the re-
                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in
                               the web request that WAF receives  for  inspec-
                               tion.  WAF  generates  the string and then uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the
                               string using colons and no  added  spaces,  for
                               example       host:user-agent:accept:authoriza-
                               tion:referer .

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match  against  the  request's  JA3 fingerprint
                               header. The header contains a hash  fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You  can use this choice only with a string
                                   match ByteMatchStatement with the Position-
                                   alConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request  doesn't  have  a  JA3
                                   fingerprint.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort  to  bypass detection. Text transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting it, and they're used in  rate-based  rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using them as  custom  aggregation  keys.  If  you
                            specify  one or more transformations to apply, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent,  starting  from the lowest priority setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations.  WAF  processes all
                                   transformations, from  lowest  priority  to
                                   highest,  before inspecting the transformed
                                   content. The priorities don't  need  to  be
                                   consecutive,  but  they must all be differ-
                                   ent.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   For detailed descriptions of  each  of  the
                                   transformation  types, see Text transforma-
                                   tions in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                        A rate-based rule counts incoming  requests  and  rate
                        limits  requests  when  they  are coming at too fast a
                        rate. The rule categorizes requests according to  your
                        aggregation  criteria,  collects them into aggregation
                        instances, and counts and rate limits the requests for
                        each instance.

                        You  can  specify individual aggregation keys, like IP
                        address or HTTP method. You can also specify  aggrega-
                        tion  key  combinations,  like  IP  address  and  HTTP
                        method, or HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

                        Each unique set of values  for  the  aggregation  keys
                        that  you  specify is a separate aggregation instance,
                        with the value from each key contributing to  the  ag-
                        gregation instance definition.

                        For  example,  assume  the rule evaluates web requests
                        with the following IP address and HTTP method values:

                        o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                        o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                        o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                        o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                        The rule would create different aggregation  instances
                        according to your aggregation criteria, for example:

                        o If  the aggregation criteria is just the IP address,
                          then each individual address is an  aggregation  in-
                          stance, and WAF counts requests separately for each.
                          The aggregation instances and request counts for our
                          example would be the following:

                          o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                          o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                        o If  the  aggregation  criteria  is HTTP method, then
                          each individual HTTP method is  an  aggregation  in-
                          stance. The aggregation instances and request counts
                          for our example would be the following:

                          o HTTP method POST: count 2

                          o HTTP method GET: count 2

                        o If the aggregation criteria is IP address  and  HTTP
                          method,  then  each  IP address and each HTTP method
                          would contribute to  the  combined  aggregation  in-
                          stance. The aggregation instances and request counts
                          for our example would be the following:

                          o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1

                          o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2

                          o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1

                        For any n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique  com-
                        bination of values for the keys defines a separate ag-
                        gregation instance, which WAF counts  and  rate-limits
                        individually.

                        You  can  optionally nest another statement inside the
                        rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the  rule
                        so  that  it only counts and rate limits requests that
                        match the nested statement. You can  use  this  nested
                        scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggrega-
                        tion key specifications or you can just count and rate
                        limit  all  requests  that match the scope-down state-
                        ment, without additional aggregation. When you  choose
                        to  just  manage  all requests that match a scope-down
                        statement, the aggregation instance  is  singular  for
                        the rule.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RateBasedStatement inside another
                        statement,  for  example  inside  a  NotStatement   or
                        OrStatement  . You can define a RateBasedStatement in-
                        side a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                        For additional information about the options, see Rate
                        limiting  web  requests  using rate-based rules in the
                        WAF Developer Guide .

                        If you only aggregate on the individual IP address  or
                        forwarded  IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP
                        addresses that WAF is currently rate  limiting  for  a
                        rule  through  the  API call GetRateBasedStatementMan-
                        agedKeys . This option is not available for other  ag-
                        gregation configurations.

                        WAF  tracks  and  manages  web requests separately for
                        each instance of a rate-based rule that you  use.  For
                        example,  if you provide the same rate-based rule set-
                        tings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements
                        represents  a separate instance of the rate-based rule
                        and gets its own tracking and management  by  WAF.  If
                        you  define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and
                        then use that rule group in multiple places, each  use
                        creates  a  separate  instance  of the rate-based rule
                        that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

                        Limit -> (long)
                            The limit on requests per 5-minute  period  for  a
                            single  aggregation  instance  for  the rate-based
                            rule.  If  the  rate-based  statement  includes  a
                            ScopeDownStatement , this limit is applied only to
                            the requests that match the statement.

                            Examples:

                            o If you aggregate on just the IP address, this is
                              the  limit  on  requests  from any single IP ad-
                              dress.

                            o If you aggregate on  the  HTTP  method  and  the
                              query  argument  name  "city",  then this is the
                              limit on requests for any  single  method,  city
                              pair.

                        AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                            Setting  that  indicates  how to aggregate the re-
                            quest counts.

                            NOTE:
                               Web requests that are missing any of the compo-
                               nents  specified  in  the  aggregation keys are
                               omitted from the rate-based rule evaluation and
                               handling.

                            o CONSTANT  -  Count  and  limit the requests that
                              match the rate-based  rule's  scope-down  state-
                              ment.  With  this  option,  the counted requests
                              aren't further aggregated. The scope-down state-
                              ment  is  the  only specification used. When the
                              count  of  all   requests   that   satisfy   the
                              scope-down  statement  goes  over the limit, WAF
                              applies the rule action  to  all  requests  that
                              satisfy the scope-down statement.  With this op-
                              tion, you must configure the  ScopeDownStatement
                              property.

                            o CUSTOM_KEYS - Aggregate the request counts using
                              one or more web request components as the aggre-
                              gate  keys.  With  this option, you must specify
                              the aggregate keys in the  CustomKeys  property.
                              To  aggregate on only the IP address or only the
                              forwarded IP address, don't use custom keys. In-
                              stead,  set the aggregate key type to IP or FOR-
                              WARDED_IP .

                            o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                              the  first  IP  address in an HTTP header.  With
                              this option, you must specify the header to  use
                              in the ForwardedIPConfig property.  To aggregate
                              on a combination of  the  forwarded  IP  address
                              with other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                            o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the IP ad-
                              dress from the web request origin. To  aggregate
                              on  a  combination  of the IP address with other
                              aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the web requests that are evaluated and
                            managed by the rate-based statement. When you  use
                            a  scope-down  statement, the rate-based rule only
                            tracks and rate limits  requests  that  match  the
                            scope-down  statement.  You  can  use any nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest  statements at any level, the same as you can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  for  WAF  to apply to web requests. The
                               byte match  statement  provides  the  bytes  to
                               search  for,  the location in requests that you
                               want WAF to search,  and  other  settings.  The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds with ASCII characters. In  the  WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A string value that you want WAF to  search
                                   for.  WAF  searches only in the part of web
                                   requests that you designate for  inspection
                                   in   FieldToMatch  .  The maximum length of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid values depend on the  component  that
                                   you  specify for inspection in FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method : The HTTP method  that  you  want
                                     WAF  to  search  for.  This indicates the
                                     type of operation specified  in  the  re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF to
                                     search for in the URI path, for  example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   o JA3Fingerprint  :  The  string  to  match
                                     against the web request's JA3 fingerprint
                                     header.  The  header contains a hash fin-
                                     gerprint of the TLS Client  Hello  packet
                                     for the request.

                                   o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list of
                                     header names to match for. WAF creates  a
                                     string  that contains the ordered list of
                                     header names, from the headers in the web
                                     request,  and  then  matches against that
                                     string.

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see  the  Body

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF

                                          is larger than the limit, the under-

                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available

                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define

                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-

                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                               PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                   The area within the portion of the web  re-
                                   quest  that  you  want  WAF  to  search for
                                   SearchString .  Valid  values  include  the
                                   following:
                                      CONTAINS

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value  of  SearchString  ,  and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _).  In  addition,  SearchString  must be a
                                   word, which means that both of the  follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the
                                     specified part of the web request  or  is
                                     preceded by a character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric character or  underscore  (_).
                                     Examples  include  the  value of a header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString is at the end of the  speci-
                                     fied  part  of the web request or is fol-

                                   The value of the specified part of the  web
                                   request  must  exactly  match  the value of
                                   SearchString .

                                   The value of SearchString  must  appear  at
                                   the  beginning of the specified part of the
                                   web request.
                                      ENDS_WITH

                                   The value of SearchString  must  appear  at
                                   the  end  of  the specified part of the web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that  inspects  for  malicious
                               SQL  code.  Attackers insert malicious SQL code
                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-

                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)

                               SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                                   The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to
                                   inspect for SQL injection attacks.
                                      HIGH  detects  more  attacks,  but might
                                      generate  more  false  positives,  espe-
                                      cially  if  your web requests frequently
                                      contain unusual strings. For information

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources that already have other  protec-
                                      tions  against  SQL injection attacks or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement that inspects for cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) attacks. In  XSS  attacks,  the
                               attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign web-
                               site  as  a   vehicle   to   inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that

                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of

                                          cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body,  WAF inspects only the number of bytes of
                               the body up to the limit for the  web  ACL.  By
                               default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8
                               KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront  web  ACLs,
                               this  limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For Cloud-
                               Front web ACLs, you can increase the  limit  in
                               the  web ACL AssociationConfig , for additional
                               fees. If you know that  the  request  body  for
                               your  web  requests should never exceed the in-
                               spection limit, you could use a size constraint
                               statement  to block requests that have a larger
                               request body size.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see  the  Body

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF

                                          is larger than the limit, the under-

                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available

                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define

                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-

                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The  operator to use to compare the request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The size, in byte, to compare  to  the  re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that labels  web  requests  by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests based on country  code.  A  geo  match
                               rule  labels every request that it inspects re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To manage requests only by country,  you  can
                                 use  this statement by itself and specify the
                                 countries that you want to match  against  in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then,  add  one  or more label match rules to
                                 run after the geo match  rule  and  configure
                                 them  to  match against the geographic labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF labels requests using the  alpha-2  country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF  determines  the  codes using either the IP
                               address in the web request origin  or,  if  you
                               specify  it,  the address in the geo match For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If you use the web request  origin,  the  label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If  you  use  a forwarded IP address, the label
                               formats are  awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               For additional details,  see  Geographic  match
                               rule statement in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An  array  of  two-character  country codes
                                   that you want to match against,  for  exam-
                                   ple,  [  "US",  "CN"  ]  , from the alpha-2
                                   country ISO codes of the ISO 3166  interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the region and country labels that it  adds
                                   to  requests,  you  still  have to supply a
                                   country code for the rule to  evaluate.  In
                                   this  case,  you configure the rule to only
                                   count matching requests, but it will  still
                                   generate  logging and count metrics for any
                                   matches. You can  reduce  the  logging  and
                                   metrics  that the rule produces by specify-
                                   ing a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be  a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  . You cannot use a rule group ref-
                               erence statement inside another rule group. You
                               can  only reference a rule group as a top-level
                               statement within a rule that you  define  in  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules in the referenced  rule  group  whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead  of this option, use RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action

                                   Action settings to use in the place of  the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule group. You specify  one  override  for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You  can use overrides for testing, for ex-
                                   ample you can override all of rule  actions
                                   to  Count  and  then  monitor the resulting
                                   count metrics to understand  how  the  rule
                                   group  would  handle  your web traffic. You
                                   can also permanently override some  or  all
                                   actions,  to modify how the rule group man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                                        Value -> (string)

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request  bodies, see the Body

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             both.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  cookies
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-

                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rate-based rule counts incoming requests and
                               rate limits requests when they  are  coming  at
                               too  fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests
                               according to your  aggregation  criteria,  col-
                               lects  them  into  aggregation  instances,  and
                               counts and rate limits the  requests  for  each
                               instance.

                               You  can  specify  individual aggregation keys,
                               like IP address or HTTP method.  You  can  also
                               specify  aggregation  key combinations, like IP
                               address and HTTP method, or HTTP method,  query
                               argument, and cookie.

                               Each  unique  set of values for the aggregation
                               keys that you specify is a separate aggregation
                               instance,  with  the  value  from each key con-
                               tributing to the aggregation  instance  defini-
                               tion.

                               For  example, assume the rule evaluates web re-
                               quests with the following IP address  and  HTTP
                               method values:

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               The rule would create different aggregation in-
                               stances according to your aggregation criteria,
                               for example:

                               o If  the  aggregation  criteria is just the IP
                                 address, then each individual address  is  an
                                 aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
                                 separately  for  each.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances  and  request  counts for our example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                 o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                               o If the aggregation criteria is  HTTP  method,
                                 then each individual HTTP method is an aggre-
                                 gation instance.  The  aggregation  instances
                                 and  request  counts for our example would be
                                 the following:

                                 o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                 o HTTP method GET: count 2

                               o If the aggregation criteria is IP address and
                                 HTTP  method,  then  each IP address and each
                                 HTTP method would contribute to the  combined
                                 aggregation  instance.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances and request counts  for  our  example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP  address  10.1.1.1,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count
                                   2

                                 o IP  address  127.0.0.0,  HTTP  method POST:
                                   count 1

                               For  any  n-tuple  of  aggregation  keys,  each
                               unique  combination  of values for the keys de-
                               fines a separate  aggregation  instance,  which
                               WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

                               You  can  optionally nest another statement in-
                               side the rate-based statement,  to  narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule so that it only counts and
                               rate limits  requests  that  match  the  nested
                               statement.  You  can use this nested scope-down
                               statement in conjunction with your  aggregation
                               key  specifications  or  you can just count and
                               rate  limit  all  requests   that   match   the
                               scope-down statement, without additional aggre-
                               gation. When you choose to just manage all  re-
                               quests  that  match a scope-down statement, the
                               aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment or OrStatement . You can  define  a  Rate-
                               BasedStatement  inside  a  web ACL and inside a
                               rule group.

                               For additional information about  the  options,
                               see Rate limiting web requests using rate-based
                               rules in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               If you only aggregate on the individual IP  ad-
                               dress or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve
                               the list of IP addresses that WAF is  currently
                               rate  limiting  for a rule through the API call
                               GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys . This  option
                               is not available for other aggregation configu-
                               rations.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single aggregation instance  for  the
                                   rate-based  rule.  If the rate-based state-
                                   ment includes a ScopeDownStatement  ,  this
                                   limit  is applied only to the requests that
                                   match the statement.

                                   Examples:

                                   o If you aggregate on just the IP  address,
                                     this  is  the  limit on requests from any
                                     single IP address.

                                   o If you aggregate on the HTTP  method  and
                                     the query argument name "city", then this
                                     is the limit on requests for  any  single
                                     method, city pair.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components  specified in the aggregation
                                      keys are  omitted  from  the  rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   o CONSTANT  -  Count and limit the requests
                                     that   match   the   rate-based    rule's
                                     scope-down  statement.  With this option,
                                     the counted requests aren't  further  ag-
                                     gregated. The scope-down statement is the
                                     only specification used. When  the  count
                                     of   all   requests   that   satisfy  the
                                     scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                     WAF  applies  the  rule action to all re-
                                     quests that satisfy the scope-down state-
                                     ment.  With this option, you must config-
                                     ure the ScopeDownStatement property.

                                   o CUSTOM_KEYS  -  Aggregate   the   request
                                     counts using one or more web request com-
                                     ponents as the aggregate keys. With  this
                                     option,  you  must  specify the aggregate
                                     keys in the CustomKeys property.  To  ag-
                                     gregate  on  only  the IP address or only
                                     the forwarded IP address, don't use  cus-
                                     tom  keys. Instead, set the aggregate key
                                     type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  With this option, you must spec-
                                     ify the header to use in the ForwardedIP-
                                     Config property.  To aggregate on a  com-
                                     bination of the forwarded IP address with
                                     other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the
                                     IP  address  from the web request origin.
                                     To aggregate on a combination of  the  IP
                                     address  with  other  aggregate keys, use
                                     CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if you specify a forwarded
                                   IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               CustomKeys -> (list)
                                   Specifies  the  aggregate  keys to use in a
                                   rate-base rule.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single custom aggregate  key
                                      for a rate-base rule.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the components specified in the  ag-

                                          Use  the request's HTTP method as an

                                          each method fully defines an  aggre-

                                      ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                          Use  the first IP address in an HTTP
                                          header as  an  aggregate  key.  Each
                                          distinct  forwarded  IP address con-

                                          When  you specify an IP or forwarded
                                          IP in the custom key  settings,  you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key to use.  You  can  aggregate  on
                                          only  the  forwarded  IP  address by
                                          specifying  FORWARDED_IP   in   your

                                          With this option, you  must  specify

                                          dress as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct IP address contributes to  the
                                          aggregation instance.

                                          When  you specify an IP or forwarded
                                          IP in the custom key  settings,  you

                                          only the IP address by specifying IP
                                          in your rate-based  statement's  Ag-

                                          Use the specified label namespace as
                                          an  aggregate  key.  Each   distinct
                                          fully  qualified label name that has
                                          the specified label  namespace  con-

                                          stance. If you use  just  one  label
                                          namespace  as  your custom key, then
                                          each label name fully defines an ag-
                                          gregation instance.

                                          This uses only labels that have been
                                          added to the request by  rules  that

                                             The namespace to use for aggrega-
                                             tion.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's URI path as an ag-
                                          gregate  key. Each distinct URI path
                                          contributes to the  aggregation  in-
                                          stance. If you use just the URI path
                                          as your custom key,  then  each  URI
                                          path  fully  defines  an aggregation
                                          instance.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate
                                             some  of  the  unusual formatting

                                             used in rule match statements, to

                                             or more transformations to apply,
                                             WAF performs all  transformations

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to combine with AND logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to  combine with OR logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a managed rule group. To  use  this,
                               provide  the  vendor  name  and the name of the
                               rule group in this statement. You can  retrieve
                               the  required names by calling  ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You cannot  use  a  managed  rule
                               group  inside  another rule group. You can only
                               reference a managed rule group as  a  top-level
                               statement  within  a  rule that you define in a
                               web ACL.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify a rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules in the referenced  rule  group  whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement to match against  labels  that
                               have  been  added  to  the web request by rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space  specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the  transformation  types, see Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses in
                            an HTTP header that you specify, instead of  using
                            the  IP address that's reported by the web request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            This  is required if you specify a forwarded IP in
                            the rule's aggregate key settings.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The name of the HTTP header to use for  the  IP
                               address.   For   example,  to  use  the  X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header,  set  this  to  X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a valid IP  address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You  can  specify the following fallback behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                        CustomKeys -> (list)
                            Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a rate-base
                            rule.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies a single custom aggregate key  for  a
                               rate-base rule.

                               NOTE:
                                   Web  requests  that  are missing any of the
                                   components  specified  in  the  aggregation
                                   keys  are  omitted from the rate-based rule
                                   evaluation and handling.

                               Header -> (structure)
                                   Use the value of a header in the request as
                                   an  aggregate  key.  Each distinct value in
                                   the header contributes to  the  aggregation
                                   instance.  If  you  use  a single header as
                                   your custom key, then each value fully  de-
                                   fines an aggregation instance.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the header to use.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-

                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-

                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form the FieldToMatch request  component
                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF  processes  all   transforma-
                                             tions,  from  lowest  priority to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed  content. The priori-

                                             of  the transformation types, see

                               HTTPMethod -> (structure)
                                   Use  the request's HTTP method as an aggre-
                                   gate key. Each distinct  HTTP  method  con-
                                   tributes  to  the  aggregation instance. If
                                   you use just the HTTP method as your custom
                                   key,  then each method fully defines an ag-
                                   gregation instance.

                               ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                   Use the first IP address in an HTTP  header
                                   as  an  aggregate  key.  Each distinct for-
                                   warded IP address contributes to the aggre-
                                   gation instance.

                                   When  you  specify an IP or forwarded IP in
                                   the custom  key  settings,  you  must  also
                                   specify  at least one other key to use. You
                                   can aggregate on only the forwarded IP  ad-
                                   dress  by  specifying  FORWARDED_IP in your
                                   rate-based statement's AggregateKeyType .

                                   With this  option,  you  must  specify  the
                                   header to use in the rate-based rule's For-
                                   wardedIPConfig property.

                               IP -> (structure)
                                   Use the request's originating IP address as
                                   an  aggregate key. Each distinct IP address
                                   contributes to the aggregation instance.

                                   When you specify an IP or forwarded  IP  in
                                   the  custom  key  settings,  you  must also
                                   specify at least one other key to use.  You
                                   can  aggregate  on  only  the IP address by
                                   specifying IP  in  your  rate-based  state-
                                   ment's AggregateKeyType .

                               LabelNamespace -> (structure)
                                   Use the specified label namespace as an ag-
                                   gregate key. Each distinct fully  qualified
                                   label  name  that  has  the specified label
                                   namespace contributes  to  the  aggregation
                                   instance.  If  you use just one label name-
                                   space as your custom key, then  each  label
                                   name fully defines an aggregation instance.

                                   This  uses only labels that have been added
                                   to the request by rules that are  evaluated
                                   before this rate-based rule in the web ACL.

                                   For  information about label namespaces and
                                   names, see Label syntax and naming require-

                                   Namespace -> (string)
                                      The namespace to use for aggregation.

                               UriPath -> (structure)
                                   Use  the request's URI path as an aggregate
                                   key. Each distinct URI path contributes  to
                                   the  aggregation  instance. If you use just
                                   the URI path as your custom key, then  each
                                   URI  path  fully defines an aggregation in-
                                   stance.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers

                     AndStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to  combine  other  rule
                        statements  with  AND logic. You provide more than one
                        Statement within the AndStatement .

                        Statements -> (list)
                            The statements to combine with AND logic. You  can
                            use any statements that can be nested.

                            (structure)
                               The  processing  guidance for a  Rule , used by
                               WAF to determine whether a web request  matches
                               the rule.

                               For  example  specifications,  see the examples
                               section of  CreateWebACL .

                               ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search  for  WAF to apply to web re-
                                   quests. The byte match  statement  provides
                                   the  bytes  to  search for, the location in
                                   requests that you want WAF to  search,  and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically a string  that  corresponds  with
                                   ASCII  characters.  In  the WAF console and
                                   the  developer  guide,  this  is  called  a
                                   string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A  string  value  that  you  want WAF to
                                      search for. WAF  searches  only  in  the
                                      part  of web requests that you designate
                                      for inspection in   FieldToMatch  .  The
                                      maximum  length  of  the  value  is  200
                                      bytes.

                                      Valid values  depend  on  the  component
                                      that   you  specify  for  inspection  in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF  to search for. This indicates the
                                        type of operation specified in the re-
                                        quest.

                                      o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF
                                        to search for in the URI path, for ex-
                                        ample, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      o JA3Fingerprint  :  The string to match
                                        against the web request's JA3  finger-
                                        print  header.  The  header contains a
                                        hash fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client
                                        Hello packet for the request.

                                      o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list
                                        of header names to match for. WAF cre-
                                        ates  a  string  that contains the or-
                                        dered list of header names,  from  the
                                        headers  in  the web request, and then
                                        matches against that string.

                                      If  SearchString   includes   alphabetic
                                      characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify a base64-encoded version of  the
                                      value.  The  maximum length of the value
                                      before  you  base64-encode  it  is   200
                                      bytes.

                                      For  example,  suppose the value of Type
                                      is HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data  is
                                      User-Agent  .  If you want to search the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you   base64-encode  BadBot  using  MIME
                                      base64-encoding and include the  result-
                                      ing  value,  QmFkQm90  , in the value of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If you're using the CLI  or  one  of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The  value  that  you want WAF to search
                                      for. The SDK  automatically  base64  en-
                                      codes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part  of  the  web request that you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately, you can filter and  in-
                                          spect  all  headers with the Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the part of the web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-

                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-
                                             vice only forwards  the  contents
                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The default limit is 8 KB  (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according to the  rule  inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL  action settings, so that you
                                             block any request whose  body  is
                                             over the limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-

                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             web request.

                                             You must specify exactly one set-

                                      JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                          Match against the request's JA3 fin-
                                          gerprint header. The header contains
                                          a hash fingerprint of the TLS Client
                                          Hello packet for the request.

                                          NOTE:
                                             You can use this choice only with
                                             a string match ByteMatchStatement
                                             with the PositionalConstraint set

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form the FieldToMatch request  component
                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF  processes  all   transforma-
                                             tions,  from  lowest  priority to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed  content. The priori-
                                             ties don't need  to  be  consecu-
                                             tive,  but  they must all be dif-
                                             ferent.

                                   PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                      The  area  within the portion of the web
                                      request that you want WAF to search  for
                                      SearchString  . Valid values include the
                                      following:
                                          CONTAINS

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      but the location doesn't matter.
                                          CONTAINS_WORD

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      and SearchString must contain  only  al-

                                      (A-Z, a-z,  0-9,  or  _).  In  addition,
                                      SearchString must be a word, which means
                                      that both of the following are true:

                                      o SearchString is at  the  beginning  of
                                        the  specified part of the web request

                                        than  an alphanumeric character or un-
                                        derscore  (_).  Examples  include  the
                                        value of a header and ;BadBot .

                                      o SearchString  is  at  the  end  of the
                                        specified part of the web  request  or
                                        is  followed by a character other than
                                        an alphanumeric  character  or  under-
                                        score  (_),  for  example, BadBot; and

                               SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that  inspects  for  mali-
                                   cious  SQL code. Attackers insert malicious
                                   SQL code into web  requests  to  do  things
                                   like  modify  your database or extract data
                                   from it.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-

                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-

                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For

                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match only the specified  in-

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according to the  rule  inspec-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or

                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-

                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you

                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                   in  a benign website as a vehicle to inject
                                   malicious client-site  scripts  into  other
                                   legitimate web browsers.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part  of  the  web request that you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately, you can filter and  in-
                                          spect  all  headers with the Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the part of the web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8
                                          KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-
                                             quest body if  the  body  exceeds
                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-
                                             vice only forwards  the  contents
                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The default limit is 8 KB  (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according to the  rule  inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize
                                             handling with your rule  and  web
                                             ACL  action settings, so that you
                                             block any request whose  body  is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-

                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                          Inspect  the  request  headers.  You
                                          must  configure  scope  and  pattern

                                          WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                          host service. You must configure how

                                          to the headers that it receives from
                                          the underlying host service.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The filter to use to identify the
                                             subset of headers to inspect in a
                                             web request.

                                             You must specify exactly one set-

                                                 Inspect all headers.

                                             IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                                 Inspect only the headers that

                                             ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                                 Inspect   only   the  headers
                                                 whose keys don't match any of
                                                 the strings specified here.

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the headers

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form the FieldToMatch request  component
                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF  processes  all   transforma-
                                             tions,  from  lowest  priority to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed  content. The priori-
                                             ties don't need  to  be  consecu-
                                             tive,  but  they must all be dif-
                                             ferent.

                                          Type -> (string)

                                             of  the transformation types, see

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule statement that compares a number of
                                   bytes against the size of a request  compo-
                                   nent,  using a comparison operator, such as
                                   greater than (>) or less than (<). For  ex-
                                   ample, you can use a size constraint state-
                                   ment to look for  query  strings  that  are
                                   longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes
                                   of  the  body  up  to the limit for the web
                                   ACL. By default,  for  regional  web  ACLs,
                                   this  limit  is  8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for
                                   CloudFront web ACLs, this limit  is  16  KB
                                   (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront web ACLs,
                                   you can increase the limit in the  web  ACL
                                   AssociationConfig , for additional fees. If
                                   you know that the request body for your web
                                   requests should never exceed the inspection
                                   limit, you  could  use  a  size  constraint
                                   statement  to  block  requests  that have a
                                   larger request body size.

                                   If you choose URI for the value of Part  of
                                   the  request to filter on, the slash (/) in
                                   the URI counts as one character. For  exam-
                                   ple,  the  URI /logo.jpg is nine characters
                                   long.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For
                                          regional resources, the limit  is  8
                                          KB  (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8

                                                 You  must specify either this

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF

                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-

                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                          tion. WAF generates the  string  and
                                          then uses that as the field to match
                                          component  in  its  inspection.  WAF
                                          separates  the  header  names in the
                                          string using  colons  and  no  added

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the headers
                                             of the request are more  numerous
                                             or  larger  than WAF can inspect.
                                             WAF does not  support  inspecting
                                             the  entire  contents  of request
                                             headers when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes)  or 200 total head-
                                             ers. The underlying host  service
                                             forwards a maximum of 200 headers
                                             and at most 8 KB of  header  con-

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  headers normally, accord-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule

                                      JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                          Match against the request's JA3 fin-
                                          gerprint header. The header contains
                                          a hash fingerprint of the TLS Client
                                          Hello packet for the request.

                                          NOTE:
                                             You can use this choice only with
                                             a string match ByteMatchStatement
                                             with the PositionalConstraint set
                                             to EXACTLY .

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use to compare  the  re-
                                      quest part to the size setting.

                                   Size -> (long)
                                      The size, in byte, to compare to the re-
                                      quest part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the relative processing or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF   processes  all  transforma-
                                             tions, from  lowest  priority  to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-
                                             ties  don't  need  to be consecu-
                                             tive, but they must all  be  dif-

                               GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that labels  web  requests
                                   by  country  and  region  and  that matches
                                   against web requests based on country code.
                                   A  geo match rule labels every request that
                                   it inspects regardless of whether it  finds
                                   a match.

                                   o To  manage  requests only by country, you
                                     can use  this  statement  by  itself  and
                                     specify  the  countries  that you want to
                                     match against in the CountryCodes array.

                                   o Otherwise, configure your geo match  rule
                                     with  Count action so that it only labels
                                     requests. Then, add  one  or  more  label
                                     match  rules  to  run after the geo match
                                     rule and configure them to match  against
                                     the  geographic labels and handle the re-
                                     quests as needed.

                                   WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 coun-
                                   try and region codes from the International
                                   Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166
                                   standard.  WAF  determines  the codes using
                                   either the IP address in  the  web  request
                                   origin  or,  if you specify it, the address
                                   in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                                   If you use the web request origin, the  la-
                                   bel   formats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:re-
                                   gion:<ISO country code>-<ISO  region  code>
                                   and  awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO coun-
                                   try code> .

                                   If you use a forwarded IP address, the  la-
                                   bel  formats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:re-
                                   gion:<ISO country code>-<ISO  region  code>
                                   and     awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO
                                   country code> .

                                   match  rule  statement in the WAF Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   CountryCodes -> (list)
                                      An array of two-character country  codes
                                      that  you want to match against, for ex-
                                      ample, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the alpha-2
                                      country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 inter-
                                      national standard.

                                      When you use a geo match statement  just
                                      for  the  region and country labels that
                                      it adds to requests, you still  have  to
                                      supply  a  country  code for the rule to
                                      evaluate. In this  case,  you  configure
                                      the  rule  to  only  count  matching re-
                                      quests, but it will still generate  log-
                                      ging  and count metrics for any matches.
                                      You can reduce the logging  and  metrics
                                      that  the  rule produces by specifying a
                                      country that's unlikely to be  a  source
                                      of traffic to your site.

                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't

                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,
                                   create  a  rule group with your rules, then
                                   provide the ARN of the rule group  in  this
                                   statement.

                                   You  cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment , for example for use  inside  a  Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You cannot use a
                                   rule group reference statement  inside  an-
                                   other  rule group. You can only reference a
                                   rule group as a top-level statement  within
                                   a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules in the referenced rule group whose
                                      actions are set to Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead  of this option, use RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count .

                                          NOTE:
                                             Instead of this option, use Rule-
                                             ActionOverrides . It accepts  any
                                             valid  action  setting, including
                                             Count .

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                                   RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                      Action  settings  to use in the place of
                                      the rule actions that are configured in-
                                      side  the  rule  group.  You specify one
                                      override for each rule whose action  you
                                      want to change.

                                      You  can  use overrides for testing, for
                                      example you can override all of rule ac-
                                      tions  to Count and then monitor the re-
                                      sulting count metrics to understand  how
                                      the  rule  group  would  handle your web
                                      traffic. You can also permanently  over-
                                      ride  some or all actions, to modify how
                                      the rule group manages your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Action setting to use in  the  place
                                          of  a rule action that is configured
                                          inside the rule group.  You  specify
                                          one override for each rule whose ac-
                                          tion you want to change.

                                          You can use overrides  for  testing,
                                          for  example you can override all of
                                          rule actions to Count and then moni-
                                          tor  the  resulting count metrics to
                                          understand how the rule group  would
                                          handle  your  web  traffic.  You can
                                          also permanently  override  some  or
                                          all  actions, to modify how the rule
                                          group manages your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule to override.

                                             The override action  to  use,  in
                                             place of the configured action of
                                             the rule in the rule group.

                                             Block -> (structure)
                                                 Instructs WAF  to  block  the

                                                           Value -> (string)

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  used  to detect web re-
                                   quests coming from particular IP  addresses
                                   or  address  ranges. To use this, create an
                                   IPSet that specifies the addresses you want
                                   to  detect, then use the ARN of that set in
                                   this statement. To create an  IP  set,  see
                                   CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set. You create and maintain the set  inde-
                                   pendent  of  your rules. This allows you to
                                   use the single set in multiple rules.  When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for the IP address. The  header  can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client and also of proxies. For  ex-
                                          ample,  the  header  value  could be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where  the  first IP address identi-
                                          fies the  original  client  and  the
                                          rest  identify  proxies that the re-
                                          quest went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the
                                          following:

                                          o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP ad-
                                            dress in the list of IP  addresses
                                            in the header. This is usually the
                                            client's original IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses  in
                                            the  header  for  a  match. If the
                                            header contains more  than  10  IP
                                            addresses,  WAF  inspects the last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ->   (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions.  To  use  this,  create a  RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you  want  to  detect,  then use the ARN of
                                   that set in this statement. A  web  request
                                   matches  the  pattern set rule statement if
                                   the request component matches  any  of  the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each regex pattern set rule statement  ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This  allows  you  to use the single set in
                                   multiple rules. When you update the  refer-
                                   enced  set,  WAF  automatically updates all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-

                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-
                                             vice only forwards  the  contents
                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                             tions, from  lowest  priority  to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rate-based rule counts incoming  requests
                                   and rate limits requests when they are com-
                                   ing at too fast a rate.  The  rule  catego-
                                   rizes  requests  according to your aggrega-
                                   tion criteria, collects them into  aggrega-
                                   tion  instances, and counts and rate limits
                                   the requests for each instance.

                                   You  can  specify  individual   aggregation
                                   keys,  like  IP address or HTTP method. You
                                   can also specify aggregation  key  combina-
                                   tions,  like IP address and HTTP method, or
                                   HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

                                   Each unique set of values for the  aggrega-
                                   tion  keys  that  you specify is a separate
                                   aggregation instance, with the  value  from
                                   each  key  contributing  to the aggregation
                                   instance definition.

                                   For example, assume the rule evaluates  web
                                   requests  with the following IP address and
                                   HTTP method values:

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                                   o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                                   The rule would create different aggregation
                                   instances  according  to  your  aggregation
                                   criteria, for example:

                                   o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the
                                     IP  address, then each individual address
                                     is  an  aggregation  instance,  and   WAF
                                     counts  requests separately for each. The
                                     aggregation instances and request  counts
                                     for our example would be the following:

                                     o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                     o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                                   o If   the  aggregation  criteria  is  HTTP
                                     method, then each individual HTTP  method
                                     is  an aggregation instance. The aggrega-
                                     tion instances and request counts for our
                                     example would be the following:

                                     o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                     o HTTP method GET: count 2

                                   o If the aggregation criteria is IP address
                                     and HTTP method, then each IP address and
                                     each  HTTP method would contribute to the
                                     combined aggregation instance. The aggre-
                                     gation  instances  and request counts for
                                     our example would be the following:

                                     o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method  POST:
                                       count 1

                                     o IP  address  10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET:
                                       count 2

                                     o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST:
                                       count 1

                                   For  any  n-tuple of aggregation keys, each
                                   unique combination of values for  the  keys
                                   defines  a  separate  aggregation instance,
                                   which WAF counts and rate-limits  individu-
                                   ally.

                                   You  can  optionally nest another statement
                                   inside the rate-based statement, to  narrow
                                   the  scope  of  the  rule  so  that it only
                                   counts and rate limits requests that  match
                                   the  nested  statement.  You  can  use this
                                   nested scope-down statement in  conjunction
                                   with your aggregation key specifications or
                                   you can just count and rate limit  all  re-
                                   quests that match the scope-down statement,
                                   without additional  aggregation.  When  you
                                   choose  to  just  manage  all requests that
                                   match a scope-down statement, the  aggrega-
                                   tion instance is singular for the rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another statement,  for  example  inside  a
                                   NotStatement  or  OrStatement . You can de-
                                   fine a RateBasedStatement inside a web  ACL
                                   and inside a rule group.

                                   For  additional  information  about the op-

                                   rate-based rules in the WAF Developer Guide
                                   .

                                   If you only aggregate on the individual  IP
                                   address  or  forwarded  IP address, you can
                                   retrieve the list of IP addresses that  WAF
                                   is  currently  rate  limiting  for  a  rule
                                   through the API call GetRateBasedStatement-
                                   ManagedKeys  . This option is not available
                                   for other aggregation configurations.

                                   WAF tracks and manages web  requests  sepa-
                                   rately  for  each  instance of a rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide  the  same rate-based rule settings in
                                   two web ACLs, each of the two  rule  state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based rule and gets its  own  tracking
                                   and  management  by  WAF.  If  you define a
                                   rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,  and
                                   then   use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                                   places, each use  creates  a  separate  in-
                                   stance of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                   own tracking and management by WAF.

                                      rate-based  statement  includes a Scope-
                                      DownStatement , this  limit  is  applied
                                      only  to  the  requests  that  match the
                                      statement.

                                      Examples:

                                      o If you aggregate on just  the  IP  ad-
                                        dress,  this  is the limit on requests
                                        from any single IP address.

                                      o If you aggregate on  the  HTTP  method
                                        and  the  query  argument name "city",
                                        then this is the limit on requests for
                                        any single method, city pair.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting  that indicates how to aggregate
                                      the request counts.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the  components specified in the ag-
                                          gregation keys are omitted from  the
                                          rate-based  rule evaluation and han-
                                          dling.

                                      o CONSTANT - Count  and  limit  the  re-
                                        quests   that   match  the  rate-based
                                        rule's scope-down statement. With this
                                        option,  the  counted  requests aren't
                                        further  aggregated.  The   scope-down
                                        statement  is  the  only specification
                                        used. When the count of  all  requests
                                        that  satisfy the scope-down statement
                                        goes over the limit, WAF  applies  the
                                        rule  action to all requests that sat-
                                        isfy the scope-down  statement.   With
                                        this  option,  you  must configure the
                                        ScopeDownStatement property.

                                      o CUSTOM_KEYS -  Aggregate  the  request
                                        counts  using  one or more web request
                                        components as the aggregate keys. With
                                        this  option, you must specify the ag-
                                        gregate keys in the  CustomKeys  prop-
                                        erty.  To aggregate on only the IP ad-
                                        dress or only  the  forwarded  IP  ad-
                                        dress, don't use custom keys. Instead,
                                        set the aggregate key type  to  IP  or
                                        FORWARDED_IP .

                                      o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request
                                        counts on the first IP address  in  an
                                        HTTP  header.   With  this option, you
                                        must specify the header to use in  the
                                        ForwardedIPConfig property.  To aggre-
                                        gate on a combination of the forwarded
                                        IP  address with other aggregate keys,
                                        use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                      o IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                                        the  IP  address  from the web request
                                        origin. To aggregate on a  combination
                                        of the IP address with other aggregate
                                        keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   ( ... recursive ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This is required if you specify  a  for-
                                      warded  IP  in  the rule's aggregate key
                                      settings.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   CustomKeys -> (list)
                                      Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a
                                      rate-base rule.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single custom  aggregate
                                          key for a rate-base rule.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Web requests that are missing any
                                             of the  components  specified  in
                                             the  aggregation keys are omitted
                                             from the rate-based rule  evalua-
                                             tion and handling.

                                          Header -> (structure)
                                             Use  the value of a header in the
                                             request as an aggregate key. Each
                                             distinct value in the header con-
                                             tributes to the  aggregation  in-
                                             stance.   If  you  use  a  single
                                             header as your custom  key,  then
                                             each  value  fully defines an ag-
                                             gregation instance.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name  of  the  header  to
                                                 use.

                                          ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                             Use  the  first  IP address in an

                                             Use  the request's originating IP
                                             address as an aggregate key. Each

                                             Use the specified label namespace
                                             as an aggregate  key.  Each  dis-

                                             just  one label namespace as your
                                             custom key, then each label  name
                                             fully  defines an aggregation in-

                                             This uses only labels  that  have
                                             been  added  to  the  request  by

                                             Use the request's URI path as  an

                                             then  each URI path fully defines

                               ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this, provide the vendor name and the  name
                                   of  the  rule  group in this statement. You
                                   can retrieve the required names by  calling

                                   or  OrStatement  . You cannot use a managed
                                   rule group inside another rule  group.  You
                                   can  only reference a managed rule group as
                                   a top-level statement within  a  rule  that
                                   you define in a web ACL.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group.  You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)

                                      use.  If  you  specify this, the version
                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you  don't  specify  this,  WAF uses the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                                           Value -> (string)

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  to match against labels
                                   that have been added to the web request  by
                                   rules that have already run in the web ACL.

                                   The  label match statement provides the la-
                                   bel or namespace string to search for.  The
                                   label string can represent a part or all of
                                   the fully qualified  label  name  that  had
                                   been added to the web request. Fully quali-
                                   fied labels have a prefix,  optional  name-
                                   spaces,  and label name. The prefix identi-
                                   fies the rule group or web ACL  context  of
                                   the  rule  that  added the label. If you do
                                   not provide the  fully  qualified  name  in
                                   your  label  match string, WAF performs the
                                   search for labels that were  added  in  the
                                   same context as the label match statement.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify  whether you want to match using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you  provide  for  this  depends  on the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If the Scope indicates  LABEL  ,  then
                                        this  specification  must  include the
                                        name and can  include  any  number  of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE ,
                                        then this  specification  can  include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings, and can  include  the  entire
                                        label  namespace  prefix from the rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of a label must be separated  by  colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for a  match  against  a  single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The  string representing the regular ex-
                                      pression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For

                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize
                                             handling  with  your rule and web
                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8
                                          KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront
                                          distributions,  the  limit  is 16 KB
                                          (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL's  Association-
                                          Config  ,  for additional processing

                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF inspects the re-

                                             against  the rule inspection cri-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match only the specified  in-

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to
                                                    include  all  paths.   In-

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-

                                             If the body is  larger  than  the

                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                          then uses that as the field to match
                                          component  in  its  inspection.  WAF
                                          separates  the  header  names in the

                                             You can use this choice only with

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the relative processing or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF   processes  all  transforma-
                                             tions, from  lowest  priority  to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-
                                             ties  don't  need  to be consecu-
                                             tive, but they must all  be  dif-
                                             ferent.

                     OrStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to  combine  other  rule
                        statements  with  OR  logic. You provide more than one
                        Statement within the OrStatement .

                        Statements -> (list)
                            The statements to combine with OR logic.  You  can
                            use any statements that can be nested.

                            (structure)
                               The  processing  guidance for a  Rule , used by
                               WAF to determine whether a web request  matches
                               the rule.

                               For  example  specifications,  see the examples
                               section of  CreateWebACL .

                               ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search  for  WAF to apply to web re-
                                   quests. The byte match  statement  provides
                                   the  bytes  to  search for, the location in
                                   requests that you want WAF to  search,  and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically a string  that  corresponds  with
                                   ASCII  characters.  In  the WAF console and
                                   the  developer  guide,  this  is  called  a
                                   string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A  string  value  that  you  want WAF to
                                      search for. WAF  searches  only  in  the
                                      part  of web requests that you designate
                                      for inspection in   FieldToMatch  .  The
                                      maximum  length  of  the  value  is  200
                                      bytes.

                                      Valid values  depend  on  the  component
                                      that   you  specify  for  inspection  in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF  to search for. This indicates the
                                        type of operation specified in the re-
                                        quest.

                                      o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF
                                        to search for in the URI path, for ex-

                                        print  header.  The  header contains a
                                        hash fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client
                                        Hello packet for the request.

                                      o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list
                                        of header names to match for. WAF cre-
                                        ates  a  string  that contains the or-
                                        dered list of header names,  from  the
                                        headers  in  the web request, and then
                                        matches against that string.

                                      If  SearchString   includes   alphabetic
                                      characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify a base64-encoded version of  the
                                      value.  The  maximum length of the value
                                      before  you  base64-encode  it  is   200
                                      bytes.

                                      For  example,  suppose the value of Type
                                      is HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data  is
                                      User-Agent  .  If you want to search the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you   base64-encode  BadBot  using  MIME
                                      base64-encoding and include the  result-
                                      ing  value,  QmFkQm90  , in the value of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If you're using the CLI  or  one  of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The  value  that  you want WAF to search
                                      for. The SDK  automatically  base64  en-
                                      codes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part  of  the  web request that you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately, you can filter and  in-
                                          spect  all  headers with the Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the part of the web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8
                                          KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-
                                             quest body if  the  body  exceeds
                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-
                                             vice only forwards  the  contents
                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The default limit is 8 KB  (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according to the  rule  inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL  action settings, so that you
                                             block any request whose  body  is
                                             over the limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to

                                             The options are the following:

                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             are the following:

                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                      JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                          Match against the request's JA3 fin-
                                          gerprint header. The header contains
                                          a hash fingerprint of the TLS Client
                                          Hello packet for the request.

                                          NOTE:
                                             You can use this choice only with

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web  request   if   the   request
                                             doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form the FieldToMatch request  component
                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF  processes  all   transforma-
                                             tions,  from  lowest  priority to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed  content. The priori-
                                             ties don't need  to  be  consecu-
                                             tive,  but  they must all be dif-

                                   PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                      The  area  within the portion of the web
                                      request that you want WAF to search  for
                                      SearchString  . Valid values include the
                                      following:
                                          CONTAINS

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      but the location doesn't matter.
                                          CONTAINS_WORD

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      and SearchString must contain  only  al-

                                      (A-Z, a-z,  0-9,  or  _).  In  addition,
                                      SearchString must be a word, which means
                                      that both of the following are true:

                                      o SearchString is at  the  beginning  of

                                        is  followed by a character other than
                                        an alphanumeric  character  or  under-

                                   cious  SQL code. Attackers insert malicious
                                   SQL code into web  requests  to  do  things
                                   like  modify  your database or extract data
                                   from it.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-

                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match only the specified  in-

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                             The options are the following:

                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object

                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                   A  rule   statement   that   inspects   for
                                   cross-site  scripting (XSS) attacks. In XSS
                                   attacks, the attacker uses  vulnerabilities
                                   in  a benign website as a vehicle to inject
                                   malicious client-site  scripts  into  other
                                   legitimate web browsers.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part  of  the  web request that you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately, you can filter and  in-
                                          spect  all  headers with the Headers

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the part of the web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the
                                             entire  contents  of  the web re-

                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-

                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The default limit is 8 KB  (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according to the  rule  inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                             ACL  action settings, so that you
                                             block any request whose  body  is
                                             over the limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to

                                                 but not both.

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The  parts  of  the JSON to match
                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-

                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize

                                          Inspect  the  request  headers.  You
                                          must  configure  scope  and  pattern

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The filter to use to identify the

                                             web request.

                                             You must specify exactly one set-

                                               the request.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form the FieldToMatch request  component
                                      before  inspecting  it, and they're used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them as custom aggregation keys. If  you
                                      specify  one  or more transformations to
                                      apply, WAF performs all  transformations
                                      on  the specified content, starting from
                                      the lowest priority  setting,  and  then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF  processes  all   transforma-
                                             tions,  from  lowest  priority to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed  content. The priori-
                                             ties don't need  to  be  consecu-
                                             tive,  but  they must all be dif-
                                             ferent.

                                          Type -> (string)

                                             of  the transformation types, see

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule statement that compares a number of
                                   bytes against the size of a request  compo-
                                   nent,  using a comparison operator, such as
                                   greater than (>) or less than (<). For  ex-
                                   ample, you can use a size constraint state-
                                   ment to look for  query  strings  that  are
                                   longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes
                                   of  the  body  up  to the limit for the web
                                   ACL. By default,  for  regional  web  ACLs,
                                   this  limit  is  8 KB (8,192 bytes) and for
                                   CloudFront web ACLs, this limit  is  16  KB
                                   (16,384  bytes).  For  CloudFront web ACLs,
                                   you can increase the limit in the  web  ACL
                                   AssociationConfig , for additional fees. If
                                   you know that the request body for your web
                                   requests should never exceed the inspection
                                   limit, you  could  use  a  size  constraint
                                   statement  to  block  requests  that have a
                                   larger request body size.

                                   If you choose URI for the value of Part  of
                                   the  request to filter on, the slash (/) in
                                   the URI counts as one character. For  exam-
                                   ple,  the  URI /logo.jpg is nine characters
                                   long.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For
                                          regional resources, the limit  is  8

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:

                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-

                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                      HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a string containing the list
                                          of  the  request's header names, or-
                                          dered as they appear in the web  re-
                                          quest  that WAF receives for inspec-
                                          tion. WAF generates the  string  and
                                          then uses that as the field to match
                                          component  in  its  inspection.  WAF
                                          separates  the  header  names in the
                                          string using  colons  and  no  added
                                          spaces,          for         example

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the headers
                                             of the request are more  numerous
                                             or  larger  than WAF can inspect.
                                             WAF does not  support  inspecting
                                             the  entire  contents  of request
                                             headers when  they  exceed  8  KB
                                             (8192  bytes)  or 200 total head-
                                             ers. The underlying host  service
                                             forwards a maximum of 200 headers
                                             and at most 8 KB of  header  con-
                                             tents to WAF.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  headers normally, accord-

                                               teria.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                               statement.

                                      JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                          Match against the request's JA3 fin-
                                          gerprint header. The header contains
                                          a hash fingerprint of the TLS Client
                                          Hello packet for the request.

                                          NOTE:
                                             You can use this choice only with
                                             a string match ByteMatchStatement
                                             with the PositionalConstraint set
                                             to EXACTLY .

                                          FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             The match status to assign to the
                                             web   request   if   the  request
                                             doesn't have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             fallback behaviors:

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use to compare  the  re-
                                      quest part to the size setting.

                                   Size -> (long)
                                      The size, in byte, to compare to the re-
                                      quest part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the relative processing or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF   processes  all  transforma-
                                             tions, from  lowest  priority  to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-
                                             ties  don't  need  to be consecu-
                                             tive, but they must all  be  dif-

                               GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that labels  web  requests
                                   by  country  and  region  and  that matches
                                   against web requests based on country code.
                                   A  geo match rule labels every request that
                                   it inspects regardless of whether it  finds
                                   a match.

                                   o To  manage  requests only by country, you
                                     can use  this  statement  by  itself  and
                                     specify  the  countries  that you want to
                                     match against in the CountryCodes array.

                                   o Otherwise, configure your geo match  rule
                                     with  Count action so that it only labels
                                     requests. Then, add  one  or  more  label
                                     match  rules  to  run after the geo match
                                     rule and configure them to match  against
                                     the  geographic labels and handle the re-
                                     quests as needed.

                                   WAF labels requests using the alpha-2 coun-
                                   try and region codes from the International
                                   Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3166
                                   standard.  WAF  determines  the codes using
                                   either the IP address in  the  web  request
                                   origin  or,  if you specify it, the address
                                   in the geo match ForwardedIPConfig .

                                   If you use the web request origin, the  la-
                                   bel   formats  are  awswaf:clientip:geo:re-
                                   gion:<ISO country code>-<ISO  region  code>
                                   and  awswaf:clientip:geo:country:<ISO coun-
                                   try code> .

                                   If you use a forwarded IP address, the  la-
                                   bel  formats are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:re-
                                   gion:<ISO country code>-<ISO  region  code>
                                   and     awswaf:forwardedip:geo:country:<ISO
                                   country code> .

                                   match  rule  statement in the WAF Developer
                                   Guide .

                                   CountryCodes -> (list)
                                      An array of two-character country  codes
                                      that  you want to match against, for ex-
                                      ample, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the alpha-2
                                      country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 inter-
                                      national standard.

                                      When you use a geo match statement  just
                                      for  the  region and country labels that
                                      it adds to requests, you still  have  to
                                      supply  a  country  code for the rule to
                                      evaluate. In this  case,  you  configure
                                      the  rule  to  only  count  matching re-
                                      quests, but it will still generate  log-
                                      ging  and count metrics for any matches.
                                      You can reduce the logging  and  metrics
                                      that  the  rule produces by specifying a
                                      country that's unlikely to be  a  source

                                   ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,
                                   create  a  rule group with your rules, then
                                   provide the ARN of the rule group  in  this
                                   statement.

                                   You  cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment , for example for use  inside  a  Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You cannot use a
                                   rule group reference statement  inside  an-
                                   other  rule group. You can only reference a
                                   rule group as a top-level statement  within
                                   a rule that you define in a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules in the referenced rule group whose
                                      actions are set to Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead  of this option, use RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count .

                                          NOTE:
                                             Instead of this option, use Rule-
                                             ActionOverrides . It accepts  any
                                             valid  action  setting, including
                                             Count .

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                                   RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                      Action  settings  to use in the place of
                                      the rule actions that are configured in-
                                      side  the  rule  group.  You specify one
                                      override for each rule whose action  you
                                      want to change.

                                      You  can  use overrides for testing, for
                                      example you can override all of rule ac-
                                      tions  to Count and then monitor the re-
                                      sulting count metrics to understand  how
                                      the  rule  group  would  handle your web
                                      traffic. You can also permanently  over-
                                      ride  some or all actions, to modify how
                                      the rule group manages your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Action setting to use in  the  place
                                          of  a rule action that is configured
                                          inside the rule group.  You  specify
                                          one override for each rule whose ac-
                                          tion you want to change.

                                          You can use overrides  for  testing,
                                          for  example you can override all of
                                          rule actions to Count and then moni-
                                          tor  the  resulting count metrics to
                                          understand how the rule group  would
                                          handle  your  web  traffic.  You can
                                          also permanently  override  some  or
                                          all  actions, to modify how the rule
                                          group manages your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule to override.

                                          ActionToUse -> (structure)
                                             The override action  to  use,  in
                                             place of the configured action of
                                             the rule in the rule group.

                                             Block -> (structure)
                                                 Instructs WAF  to  block  the
                                                 web request.

                                                 CustomResponse -> (structure)
                                                    Defines  a custom response

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  used  to detect web re-
                                   quests coming from particular IP  addresses
                                   or  address  ranges. To use this, create an
                                   IPSet that specifies the addresses you want
                                   to  detect, then use the ARN of that set in
                                   this statement. To create an  IP  set,  see
                                   CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set. You create and maintain the set  inde-
                                   pendent  of  your rules. This allows you to
                                   use the single set in multiple rules.  When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for the IP address. The  header  can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client and also of proxies. For  ex-
                                          ample,  the  header  value  could be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where  the  first IP address identi-
                                          fies the  original  client  and  the
                                          rest  identify  proxies that the re-
                                          quest went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the

                                          o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP ad-
                                            dress in the list of IP  addresses
                                            in the header. This is usually the
                                            client's original IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses  in
                                            the  header  for  a  match. If the
                                            header contains more  than  10  IP
                                            addresses,  WAF  inspects the last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ->   (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions.  To  use  this,  create a  RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you  want  to  detect,  then use the ARN of
                                   that set in this statement. A  web  request
                                   matches  the  pattern set rule statement if
                                   the request component matches  any  of  the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each regex pattern set rule statement  ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This  allows  you  to use the single set in
                                   multiple rules. When you update the  refer-
                                   enced  set,  WAF  automatically updates all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For
                                          regional resources, the limit  is  8
                                          KB  (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront
                                          distributions, the limit  is  16  KB
                                          (16,384  bytes). For CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit  in the web ACL's Association-
                                          Config , for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger than WAF can inspect.  WAF
                                             does  not  support inspecting the
                                             entire contents of  the  web  re-
                                             quest  body  if  the body exceeds
                                             the limit for the resource  type.
                                             If  the  body  is larger than the
                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-
                                             vice  only  forwards the contents
                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192
                                             bytes) for regional resources and
                                             16  KB  (16,384 bytes) for Cloud-
                                             Front distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                             Front  distributions, you can in-
                                             crease the limit in the  web  ACL
                                             AssociationConfig   ,  for  addi-
                                             tional processing fees.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize
                                             handling  with  your rule and web
                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8
                                          KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront

                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:

                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the

                                             the  limit for the resource type.
                                             If the body is  larger  than  the
                                             limit,  the  underlying host ser-
                                             vice only forwards  the  contents
                                             that  are  below the limit to WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-

                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rate-based rule counts incoming  requests
                                   and rate limits requests when they are com-
                                   ing at too fast a rate.  The  rule  catego-
                                   rizes  requests  according to your aggrega-
                                   tion criteria, collects them into  aggrega-
                                   tion  instances, and counts and rate limits
                                   the requests for each instance.

                                   You  can  specify  individual   aggregation
                                   keys,  like  IP address or HTTP method. You
                                   can also specify aggregation  key  combina-
                                   tions,  like IP address and HTTP method, or
                                   HTTP method, query argument, and cookie.

                                   Each unique set of values for the  aggrega-
                                   tion  keys  that  you specify is a separate
                                   aggregation instance, with the  value  from
                                   each  key  contributing  to the aggregation
                                   instance definition.

                                   For example, assume the rule evaluates  web
                                   requests  with the following IP address and
                                   HTTP method values:

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                                   o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                                   o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                                   The rule would create different aggregation
                                   instances  according  to  your  aggregation
                                   criteria, for example:

                                   o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the
                                     IP  address, then each individual address
                                     is  an  aggregation  instance,  and   WAF
                                     counts  requests separately for each. The
                                     aggregation instances and request  counts
                                     for our example would be the following:

                                     o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                     o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                                   o If   the  aggregation  criteria  is  HTTP
                                     method, then each individual HTTP  method
                                     is  an aggregation instance. The aggrega-
                                     tion instances and request counts for our
                                     example would be the following:

                                     o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                     o HTTP method GET: count 2

                                   o If the aggregation criteria is IP address
                                     and HTTP method, then each IP address and
                                     each  HTTP method would contribute to the
                                     combined aggregation instance. The aggre-
                                     gation  instances  and request counts for
                                     our example would be the following:

                                     o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method  POST:
                                       count 1

                                     o IP  address  10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET:
                                       count 2

                                     o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST:
                                       count 1

                                   For  any  n-tuple of aggregation keys, each
                                   unique combination of values for  the  keys
                                   defines  a  separate  aggregation instance,
                                   which WAF counts and rate-limits  individu-
                                   ally.

                                   You  can  optionally nest another statement
                                   inside the rate-based statement, to  narrow
                                   the  scope  of  the  rule  so  that it only
                                   counts and rate limits requests that  match
                                   the  nested  statement.  You  can  use this
                                   nested scope-down statement in  conjunction
                                   with your aggregation key specifications or
                                   you can just count and rate limit  all  re-
                                   quests that match the scope-down statement,
                                   without additional  aggregation.  When  you
                                   choose  to  just  manage  all requests that
                                   match a scope-down statement, the  aggrega-
                                   tion instance is singular for the rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another statement,  for  example  inside  a
                                   NotStatement  or  OrStatement . You can de-
                                   fine a RateBasedStatement inside a web  ACL
                                   and inside a rule group.

                                   .

                                   If you only aggregate on the individual  IP
                                   address  or  forwarded  IP address, you can
                                   retrieve the list of IP addresses that  WAF
                                   is  currently  rate  limiting  for  a  rule
                                   through the API call GetRateBasedStatement-
                                   ManagedKeys  . This option is not available
                                   for other aggregation configurations.

                                   WAF tracks and manages web  requests  sepa-
                                   rately  for  each  instance of a rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide  the  same rate-based rule settings in
                                   two web ACLs, each of the two  rule  state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based rule and gets its  own  tracking
                                   and  management  by  WAF.  If  you define a
                                   rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,  and
                                   then   use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                                   places, each use  creates  a  separate  in-
                                   stance of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                   own tracking and management by WAF.

                                   Limit -> (long)
                                      The limit on requests per  5-minute  pe-
                                      riod  for  a single aggregation instance
                                      for  the   rate-based   rule.   If   the
                                      rate-based  statement  includes a Scope-
                                      DownStatement , this  limit  is  applied
                                      only  to  the  requests  that  match the
                                      statement.

                                      Examples:

                                      o If you aggregate on just  the  IP  ad-
                                        dress,  this  is the limit on requests
                                        from any single IP address.

                                      o If you aggregate on  the  HTTP  method
                                        and  the  query  argument name "city",
                                        then this is the limit on requests for
                                        any single method, city pair.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting  that indicates how to aggregate
                                      the request counts.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the  components specified in the ag-
                                          gregation keys are omitted from  the
                                          rate-based  rule evaluation and han-
                                          dling.

                                      o CONSTANT - Count  and  limit  the  re-
                                        quests   that   match  the  rate-based
                                        rule's scope-down statement. With this
                                        option,  the  counted  requests aren't
                                        further  aggregated.  The   scope-down
                                        statement  is  the  only specification
                                        used. When the count of  all  requests
                                        that  satisfy the scope-down statement
                                        goes over the limit, WAF  applies  the
                                        rule  action to all requests that sat-
                                        isfy the scope-down  statement.   With
                                        this  option,  you  must configure the
                                        ScopeDownStatement property.

                                      o CUSTOM_KEYS -  Aggregate  the  request
                                        counts  using  one or more web request
                                        components as the aggregate keys. With
                                        this  option, you must specify the ag-
                                        gregate keys in the  CustomKeys  prop-
                                        erty.  To aggregate on only the IP ad-
                                        dress or only  the  forwarded  IP  ad-
                                        dress, don't use custom keys. Instead,
                                        set the aggregate key type  to  IP  or
                                        FORWARDED_IP .

                                      o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request
                                        counts on the first IP address  in  an
                                        HTTP  header.   With  this option, you
                                        must specify the header to use in  the
                                        ForwardedIPConfig property.  To aggre-
                                        gate on a combination of the forwarded
                                        IP  address with other aggregate keys,
                                        use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                      o IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                                        the  IP  address  from the web request
                                        origin. To aggregate on a  combination
                                        of the IP address with other aggregate
                                        keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   ( ... recursive ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This is required if you specify  a  for-
                                      warded  IP  in  the rule's aggregate key
                                      settings.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   CustomKeys -> (list)
                                      Specifies the aggregate keys to use in a
                                      rate-base rule.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single custom  aggregate
                                          key for a rate-base rule.

                                          NOTE:
                                             Web requests that are missing any
                                             of the  components  specified  in
                                             the  aggregation keys are omitted
                                             from the rate-based rule  evalua-
                                             tion and handling.

                                          Header -> (structure)
                                             Use  the value of a header in the
                                             request as an aggregate key. Each
                                             distinct value in the header con-
                                             tributes to the  aggregation  in-
                                             stance.   If  you  use  a  single
                                             header as your custom  key,  then
                                             each  value  fully defines an ag-
                                             gregation instance.

                                             Name -> (string)
                                                 The name  of  the  header  to
                                                 use.

                                             Use  the  first  IP address in an

                                             fully  defines an aggregation in-

                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this, provide the vendor name and the  name
                                   of  the  rule  group in this statement. You
                                   can retrieve the required names by  calling

                                   can  only reference a managed rule group as
                                   a top-level statement within  a  rule  that
                                   you define in a web ACL.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group.  You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)

                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you  don't  specify  this,  WAF uses the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                                           Value -> (string)

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  to match against labels
                                   that have been added to the web request  by
                                   rules that have already run in the web ACL.

                                   The  label match statement provides the la-
                                   bel or namespace string to search for.  The
                                   label string can represent a part or all of
                                   the fully qualified  label  name  that  had
                                   been added to the web request. Fully quali-
                                   fied labels have a prefix,  optional  name-
                                   spaces,  and label name. The prefix identi-
                                   fies the rule group or web ACL  context  of
                                   the  rule  that  added the label. If you do
                                   not provide the  fully  qualified  name  in
                                   your  label  match string, WAF performs the
                                   search for labels that were  added  in  the
                                   same context as the label match statement.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify  whether you want to match using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you  provide  for  this  depends  on the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If the Scope indicates  LABEL  ,  then
                                        this  specification  must  include the
                                        name and can  include  any  number  of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE ,
                                        then this  specification  can  include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings, and can  include  the  entire
                                        label  namespace  prefix from the rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of a label must be separated  by  colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for a  match  against  a  single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The  string representing the regular ex-
                                      pression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of the  web  request  that  you
                                      want WAF to inspect.

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Alternately,  you can filter and in-
                                          spect all headers with  the  Headers
                                          FieldToMatch setting.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of the web request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is forwarded to WAF  for  inspection
                                          by  the underlying host service. For

                                             limit, the underlying  host  ser-

                                             that are below the limit  to  WAF
                                             for inspection.

                                             The  default limit is 8 KB (8,192

                                             The options for oversize handling
                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,
                                               according  to  the rule inspec-
                                               tion criteria.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             You  can  combine  the  MATCH  or
                                             NO_MATCH  settings  for  oversize
                                             handling  with  your rule and web
                                             ACL action settings, so that  you
                                             block  any  request whose body is
                                             over the limit.

                                             Default: CONTINUE

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          A limited amount of the request body
                                          is  forwarded  to WAF for inspection
                                          by the underlying host service.  For
                                          regional  resources,  the limit is 8
                                          KB (8,192 bytes) and for  CloudFront
                                          distributions,  the  limit  is 16 KB
                                          (16,384 bytes). For CloudFront  dis-

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this
                                                 setting  or the IncludedPaths
                                                 setting, but not both.

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match only the specified  in-

                                                 You  must specify either this
                                                 setting or the  All  setting,
                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if the body is
                                             larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF
                                             does not support  inspecting  the

                                             are the following:

                                             o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  avail-
                                               able  body  contents  normally,

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                          tion. WAF generates the  string  and
                                          then uses that as the field to match
                                          component  in  its  inspection.  WAF

                                             You can use this choice only with

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection. Text transformations are
                                      used in rule match statements, to trans-
                                      form  the FieldToMatch request component
                                      before inspecting it, and  they're  used
                                      in rate-based rule statements, to trans-
                                      form  request  components  before  using
                                      them  as custom aggregation keys. If you
                                      specify one or more  transformations  to
                                      apply,  WAF performs all transformations
                                      on the specified content, starting  from
                                      the  lowest  priority  setting, and then
                                      uses the transformed component contents.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the relative processing or-
                                             der for multiple transformations.
                                             WAF   processes  all  transforma-
                                             tions, from  lowest  priority  to
                                             highest,  before  inspecting  the
                                             transformed content. The  priori-
                                             ties  don't  need  to be consecu-
                                             tive, but they must all  be  dif-
                                             ferent.

                     NotStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to negate the results of
                        another  rule  statement.  You  provide one  Statement
                        within the NotStatement .

                        Statement -> (structure)
                            The statement to negate. You can use any statement
                            that can be nested.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   o JA3Fingerprint  :  The  string  to  match
                                     against the web request's JA3 fingerprint
                                     header. The header contains a  hash  fin-
                                     gerprint  of  the TLS Client Hello packet
                                     for the request.

                                   o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list of
                                     header  names to match for. WAF creates a
                                     string that contains the ordered list  of
                                     header names, from the headers in the web
                                     request, and then  matches  against  that
                                     string.

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters A-Z and a-z, note that  the  value  is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the
                                   value. The maximum length of the value  be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For  example,  suppose the value of Type is
                                   HEADER and the value of Data is  User-Agent
                                   .  If  you  want  to  search the User-Agent
                                   header  for  the   value   BadBot   ,   you
                                   base64-encode  BadBot using MIME base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of

                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  cookies
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include  the  value  of  SearchString , and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _). In addition,  SearchString  must  be  a
                                   word,  which means that both of the follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the
                                     specified  part  of the web request or is
                                     preceded by a character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric  character  or underscore (_).
                                     Examples include the value  of  a  header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString  is at the end of the speci-
                                     fied part of the web request or  is  fol-
                                     lowed  by  a  character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric character or  underscore  (_),
                                     for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                                      EXACTLY

                                   The  value of the specified part of the web
                                   request must exactly  match  the  value  of
                                   SearchString .
                                      STARTS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the beginning of the specified part of  the
                                   web request.
                                      ENDS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the end of the specified part  of  the  web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that inspects for malicious
                               SQL code. Attackers insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-
                                          cludedCookies": [ "session-id-time",
                                          "session-id" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  cookies
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-

                               SensitivityLevel -> (string)
                                   The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to
                                   inspect for SQL injection attacks.
                                      HIGH detects  more  attacks,  but  might
                                      generate  more  false  positives,  espe-
                                      cially if your web  requests  frequently
                                      contain unusual strings. For information

                                      LOW is generally a better choice for re-
                                      sources  that already have other protec-
                                      tions against SQL injection  attacks  or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that inspects  for  cross-site
                               scripting  (XSS)  attacks.  In XSS attacks, the
                               attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign  web-
                               site   as   a   vehicle   to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             both.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as

                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-

                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation

                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-

                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from

                                          The priorities don't need to be con-

                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes  of
                               the  body  up  to the limit for the web ACL. By
                               default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8
                               KB  (8,192  bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs,
                               this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  Cloud-
                               Front  web  ACLs, you can increase the limit in
                               the web ACL AssociationConfig , for  additional
                               fees.  If  you  know  that the request body for
                               your web requests should never exceed  the  in-
                               spection limit, you could use a size constraint
                               statement to block requests that have a  larger
                               request body size.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request  bodies, see the Body

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)

                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                            ment.

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-

                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that labels web requests by

                               rule labels every request that it inspects  re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To  manage  requests only by country, you can
                                 use this statement by itself and specify  the
                                 countries  that  you want to match against in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then, add one or more label  match  rules  to
                                 run  after  the  geo match rule and configure
                                 them to match against the  geographic  labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF  labels  requests using the alpha-2 country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF determines the codes using  either  the  IP
                               address  in  the  web request origin or, if you
                               specify it, the address in the geo  match  For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If  you  use  the web request origin, the label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If you use a forwarded IP  address,  the  label
                               formats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array  of  two-character  country  codes
                                   that  you  want to match against, for exam-
                                   ple, [ "US", "CN"  ]  ,  from  the  alpha-2
                                   country  ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the  region and country labels that it adds
                                   to requests, you still  have  to  supply  a
                                   country  code  for the rule to evaluate. In
                                   this case, you configure the rule  to  only
                                   count  matching requests, but it will still
                                   generate logging and count metrics for  any
                                   matches.  You  can  reduce  the logging and
                                   metrics that the rule produces by  specify-
                                   ing  a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You cannot use a rule group  ref-
                               erence statement inside another rule group. You
                               can only reference a rule group as a  top-level
                               statement  within  a  rule that you define in a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead of this option, use  RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                   Action  settings to use in the place of the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule  group.  You  specify one override for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You can use overrides for testing, for  ex-
                                   ample  you can override all of rule actions
                                   to Count and  then  monitor  the  resulting
                                   count  metrics  to  understand how the rule
                                   group would handle your  web  traffic.  You
                                   can  also  permanently override some or all
                                   actions, to modify how the rule group  man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   (structure)

                                      the rule group. You specify one override
                                      for each rule whose action you  want  to
                                      change.

                                                           avoid     confusion
                                                           with   the  headers
                                                           that are already in
                                                           the   request.  For
                                                           example,  for   the
                                                           header  name sample
                                                           , WAF  inserts  the
                                                           header
                                                           x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the
                                                           custom header.

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of cookies to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                          the transformation types,  see  Text

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule counts incoming requests  and
                               rate  limits  requests  when they are coming at
                               too fast a rate. The rule categorizes  requests
                               according  to  your  aggregation criteria, col-
                               lects  them  into  aggregation  instances,  and
                               counts  and  rate  limits the requests for each
                               instance.

                               You can specify  individual  aggregation  keys,
                               like  IP  address  or HTTP method. You can also
                               specify aggregation key combinations,  like  IP
                               address  and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query
                               argument, and cookie.

                               Each unique set of values for  the  aggregation
                               keys that you specify is a separate aggregation
                               instance, with the value  from  each  key  con-
                               tributing  to  the aggregation instance defini-
                               tion.

                               For example, assume the rule evaluates web  re-
                               quests  with  the following IP address and HTTP
                               method values:

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               The rule would create different aggregation in-
                               stances according to your aggregation criteria,
                               for example:

                               o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the  IP
                                 address,  then  each individual address is an
                                 aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
                                 separately  for  each.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances and request counts  for  our  example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                 o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                               o If  the  aggregation criteria is HTTP method,
                                 then each individual HTTP method is an aggre-
                                 gation  instance.  The  aggregation instances
                                 and request counts for our example  would  be
                                 the following:

                                 o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                 o HTTP method GET: count 2

                               o If the aggregation criteria is IP address and
                                 HTTP method, then each IP  address  and  each
                                 HTTP  method would contribute to the combined
                                 aggregation  instance.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances  and  request  counts for our example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP  address  10.1.1.1,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count
                                   2

                                 o IP address  127.0.0.0,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                               For  any  n-tuple  of  aggregation  keys,  each
                               unique combination of values for the  keys  de-
                               fines  a  separate  aggregation instance, which
                               WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

                               You can optionally nest another  statement  in-
                               side  the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the
                               scope of the rule so that it  only  counts  and
                               rate  limits  requests  that  match  the nested
                               statement. You can use this  nested  scope-down
                               statement  in conjunction with your aggregation
                               key specifications or you can  just  count  and
                               rate   limit   all   requests  that  match  the
                               scope-down statement, without additional aggre-
                               gation.  When you choose to just manage all re-
                               quests that match a scope-down  statement,  the
                               aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               For  additional  information about the options,
                               see Rate limiting web requests using rate-based
                               rules in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               If  you only aggregate on the individual IP ad-
                               dress or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve
                               the  list of IP addresses that WAF is currently
                               rate limiting for a rule through the  API  call
                               GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys  . This option
                               is not available for other aggregation configu-
                               rations.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for  a  single aggregation instance for the
                                   rate-based rule. If the  rate-based  state-
                                   ment  includes  a ScopeDownStatement , this
                                   limit is applied only to the requests  that
                                   match the statement.

                                   Examples:

                                   o If  you aggregate on just the IP address,
                                     this is the limit on  requests  from  any
                                     single IP address.

                                   o If  you  aggregate on the HTTP method and
                                     the query argument name "city", then this
                                     is  the  limit on requests for any single
                                     method, city pair.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components specified in the  aggregation
                                      keys  are  omitted  from  the rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   o CONSTANT - Count and limit  the  requests
                                     that    match   the   rate-based   rule's
                                     scope-down statement. With  this  option,
                                     the  counted  requests aren't further ag-
                                     gregated. The scope-down statement is the
                                     only  specification  used. When the count
                                     of  all   requests   that   satisfy   the
                                     scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                     WAF applies the rule action  to  all  re-
                                     quests that satisfy the scope-down state-
                                     ment.  With this option, you must config-
                                     ure the ScopeDownStatement property.

                                   o CUSTOM_KEYS   -   Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts using one or more web request com-
                                     ponents  as the aggregate keys. With this
                                     option, you must  specify  the  aggregate
                                     keys  in the CustomKeys property.  To ag-
                                     gregate on only the IP  address  or  only
                                     the  forwarded IP address, don't use cus-
                                     tom keys. Instead, set the aggregate  key
                                     type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  With this option, you must spec-
                                     ify the header to use in the ForwardedIP-
                                     Config  property.  To aggregate on a com-
                                     bination of the forwarded IP address with
                                     other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web  request  origin.
                                     To  aggregate  on a combination of the IP
                                     address with other  aggregate  keys,  use
                                     CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               (   ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                               (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if you specify a forwarded
                                   IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               CustomKeys -> (list)
                                   Specifies the aggregate keys to  use  in  a
                                   rate-base rule.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single custom aggregate key
                                      for a rate-base rule.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the  components specified in the ag-
                                          gregation keys are omitted from  the
                                          rate-based  rule evaluation and han-

                                      Header -> (structure)
                                          Use the value of a header in the re-
                                          quest as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct value in the  header  contrib-
                                          utes to the aggregation instance. If
                                          you use a single header as your cus-
                                          tom  key,  then each value fully de-
                                          fines an aggregation instance.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the header to use.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate
                                             some  of  the  unusual formatting
                                             that attackers  use  in  web  re-

                                             used in rule match statements, to
                                             transform  the  FieldToMatch  re-

                                             it,   and   they're    used    in
                                             rate-based  rule  statements,  to

                                      HTTPMethod -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's HTTP method as  an
                                          aggregate  key.  Each  distinct HTTP
                                          method contributes to  the  aggrega-
                                          tion  instance.  If you use just the
                                          HTTP method as your custom key, then
                                          each  method fully defines an aggre-
                                          gation instance.

                                      ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                          Use the first IP address in an  HTTP
                                          header  as  an  aggregate  key. Each
                                          distinct forwarded IP  address  con-
                                          tributes   to  the  aggregation  in-
                                          stance.

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded
                                          IP  in  the custom key settings, you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key  to  use.  You  can aggregate on
                                          only the  forwarded  IP  address  by
                                          specifying   FORWARDED_IP   in  your
                                          rate-based statement's AggregateKey-
                                          Type .

                                          With  this  option, you must specify
                                          the header to use in the  rate-based
                                          rule's ForwardedIPConfig property.

                                      IP -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's originating IP ad-
                                          dress as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct  IP address contributes to the
                                          aggregation instance.

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded
                                          IP  in  the custom key settings, you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key  to  use.  You  can aggregate on
                                          only the IP address by specifying IP
                                          in  your  rate-based statement's Ag-
                                          gregateKeyType .

                                      LabelNamespace -> (structure)
                                          Use the specified label namespace as
                                          an   aggregate  key.  Each  distinct
                                          fully qualified label name that  has
                                          the  specified  label namespace con-
                                          tributes  to  the  aggregation   in-
                                          stance.  If  you  use just one label
                                          namespace as your custom  key,  then
                                          each label name fully defines an ag-
                                          gregation instance.

                                          This uses only labels that have been
                                          added  to  the request by rules that
                                          are evaluated before this rate-based
                                          rule in the web ACL.

                                          For  information  about  label name-
                                          spaces and names, see  Label  syntax

                                          Namespace -> (string)
                                             The namespace to use for aggrega-
                                             tion.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's URI path as an ag-
                                          gregate key. Each distinct URI  path
                                          contributes  to  the aggregation in-
                                          stance. If you use just the URI path
                                          as  your  custom  key, then each URI
                                          path fully  defines  an  aggregation
                                          instance.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting

                                             tection. Text transformations are
                                             used in rule match statements, to
                                             transform  the  FieldToMatch  re-

                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  cannot  use a managed rule
                               group inside another rule group. You  can  only
                               reference  a  managed rule group as a top-level
                               statement within a rule that you  define  in  a
                               web ACL.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify a rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement to match against labels that
                               have been added to the  web  request  by  rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space specifications  and  prefix  up  to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional

                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF

                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-

                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-

                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                     ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to run the rules  that  are  de-
                        fined  in  a  managed rule group. To use this, provide
                        the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this
                        statement.  You  can  retrieve  the  required names by
                        calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                        You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for  ex-
                        ample  for  use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You cannot use a managed  rule  group  inside  another
                        rule  group.  You  can  only  reference a managed rule
                        group as a top-level statement within a rule that  you
                        define in a web ACL.

                        NOTE:
                            You  are  charged additional fees when you use the
                            WAF Bot  Control  managed  rule  group  AWSManage-
                            dRulesBotControlRuleSet  ,  the  WAF Fraud Control
                            account takeover  prevention  (ATP)  managed  rule
                            group AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet , or the WAF Fraud
                            Control account creation fraud  prevention  (ACFP)
                            managed  rule  group  AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet .
                            For more information, see WAF Pricing .

                        VendorName -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use
                            this,  along with the rule group name, to identify
                            a rule group.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group. You use  this,
                            along  with  the vendor name, to identify the rule
                            group.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The version of the managed rule group to  use.  If
                            you specify this, the version setting is fixed un-
                            til you change it. If you don't specify this,  WAF
                            uses  the vendor's default version, and then keeps
                            the version at the vendor's default when the  ven-
                            dor updates the managed rule group settings.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            Rules  in  the referenced rule group whose actions
                            are set to Count .

                            NOTE:
                               Instead of this option, use RuleActionOverrides
                               .  It accepts any valid action setting, includ-
                               ing Count .

                            (structure)
                               Specifies a single rule in a rule  group  whose
                               action you want to override to Count .

                               NOTE:
                                   Instead of this option, use RuleActionOver-
                                   rides . It accepts any  valid  action  set-
                                   ting, including Count .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the managed rule group. Requests are  only  evalu-
                            ated   by   the  rule  group  if  they  match  the
                            scope-down statement. You  can  use  any  nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this is called
                               a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 200 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   o JA3Fingerprint  :  The  string  to  match
                                     against the web request's JA3 fingerprint
                                     header. The header contains a  hash  fin-
                                     gerprint  of  the TLS Client Hello packet
                                     for the request.

                                   o HeaderOrder : The comma-separated list of
                                     header  names to match for. WAF creates a
                                     string that contains the ordered list  of
                                     header names, from the headers in the web
                                     request, and then  matches  against  that
                                     string.

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters A-Z and a-z, note that  the  value  is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the
                                   value. The maximum length of the value  be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 200 bytes.

                                   For  example,  suppose the value of Type is
                                   HEADER and the value of Data is  User-Agent
                                   .  If  you  want  to  search the User-Agent
                                   header  for  the   value   BadBot   ,   you
                                   base64-encode  BadBot using MIME base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-

                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the

                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized  request bodies, see the Json-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  cookie  content in the Cookies ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  cookies  to inspect in a

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,
                                          or ExcludedCookies .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "In-

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the cookies to  inspect
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  cookies
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total cookies. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  cookies  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          cookie contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-
                                      cept:authorization:referer .

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the  PositionalConstraint set to EX-

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      CONTAINS

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include  the  value  of  SearchString , and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _). In addition,  SearchString  must  be  a
                                   word,  which means that both of the follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that inspects for malicious
                               SQL code. Attackers insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into web requests to do things like modify your
                               database or extract data from it.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      sources  that already have other protec-
                                      tions against SQL injection  attacks  or
                                      that have a low tolerance for false pos-
                                      itives.

                                   Default: LOW

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that inspects  for  cross-site
                               scripting  (XSS)  attacks.  In XSS attacks, the
                               attacker uses vulnerabilities in a benign  web-
                               site   as   a   vehicle   to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see  the  Body
                                      object configuration.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers whose
                                             keys  don't  match  any  of   the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the headers to match
                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as
                                      they  appear in the web request that WAF
                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the
                                      field to match component in its  inspec-
                                      tion.  WAF separates the header names in
                                      the string using  colons  and  no  added
                                      spaces,  for example host:user-agent:ac-

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-

                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-

                                          the transformation types,  see  Text

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the number of bytes  of
                               the  body  up  to the limit for the web ACL. By
                               default, for regional web ACLs, this limit is 8
                               KB  (8,192  bytes) and for CloudFront web ACLs,
                               this limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For  Cloud-
                               Front  web  ACLs, you can increase the limit in
                               the web ACL AssociationConfig , for  additional
                               fees.  If  you  know  that the request body for
                               your web requests should never exceed  the  in-
                               spection limit, you could use a size constraint
                               statement to block requests that have a  larger
                               request body size.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of the web request that  you  want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately,  you can filter and inspect
                                      all headers  with  the  Headers   Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the
                                      underlying  host  service.  For regional
                                      resources, the  limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-
                                      ciationConfig  , for additional process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions. For  CloudFront  dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig   ,  for  additional  processing
                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request  whose  body  is  over   the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      A  limited amount of the request body is
                                      forwarded to WAF for inspection  by  the

                                      the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).  For
                                      CloudFront  distributions,  you  can in-
                                      crease the limit in the web ACL's  Asso-

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Headers -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  headers.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the  set  of headers to and the parts of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-
                                      size  header  content in the Headers ob-
                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the headers that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the
                                          subset  of  headers  to inspect in a
                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          Example JSON: "MatchPattern": { "Ex-
                                          cludedHeaders":  [  "KeyToExclude1",
                                          "KeyToExclude2" ] }

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  headers  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the
                                             strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The parts of the  headers  to  match
                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the request  are  more  numerous  or
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when they exceed 8 KB  (8192  bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host service forwards a  maximum  of
                                          200  headers  and  at  most  8 KB of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            headers normally, according to the

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request  cookies.  You  must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the  set of cookies and the parts of the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of  a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must configure how to handle  any  over-

                                      ject. WAF applies the  pattern  matching
                                      filters  to the cookies that it receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The filter to use  to  identify  the

                                          web request.

                                          You must specify  exactly  one  set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedCookies ,

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all cookies.

                                          IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  cookies  that
                                             have  a  key  that matches one of
                                             the strings specified here.

                                             (string)

                                          ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                             Inspect only  the  cookies  whose
                                             keys   don't  match  any  of  the

                                          with  the  rule inspection criteria.
                                          If you specify All  ,  WAF  inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the cookies of

                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            cookies normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a string containing the list  of
                                      the  request's  header names, ordered as
                                      they appear in the web request that  WAF
                                      receives  for  inspection. WAF generates
                                      the string and then  uses  that  as  the
                                      field  to match component in its inspec-
                                      tion. WAF separates the header names  in
                                      the  string  using  colons  and no added
                                      spaces, for example  host:user-agent:ac-

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match against the request's JA3  finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash

                                      NOTE:
                                          You  can use this choice only with a

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match statements, to transform  the  Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it, and they're  used  in  rate-based  rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before using  them  as  custom  aggregation
                                   keys.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations to apply, WAF performs  all  trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing from the lowest priority  setting,  and
                                   then  uses  the  transformed component con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes  all transformations, from
                                          lowest priority to  highest,  before
                                          inspecting  the transformed content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive,  but they must all be dif-
                                          ferent.

                                      Type -> (string)

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that labels web requests by
                               country and region and that matches against web
                               requests  based  on  country  code. A geo match
                               rule labels every request that it inspects  re-
                               gardless of whether it finds a match.

                               o To  manage  requests only by country, you can
                                 use this statement by itself and specify  the
                                 countries  that  you want to match against in
                                 the CountryCodes array.

                               o Otherwise, configure your geo match rule with
                                 Count action so that it only labels requests.
                                 Then, add one or more label  match  rules  to
                                 run  after  the  geo match rule and configure
                                 them to match against the  geographic  labels
                                 and handle the requests as needed.

                               WAF  labels  requests using the alpha-2 country
                               and region codes from the International Organi-
                               zation for Standardization (ISO) 3166 standard.
                               WAF determines the codes using  either  the  IP
                               address  in  the  web request origin or, if you
                               specify it, the address in the geo  match  For-
                               wardedIPConfig .

                               If  you  use  the web request origin, the label
                               formats   are   awswaf:clientip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:cli-
                               entip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               If you use a forwarded IP  address,  the  label
                               formats  are awswaf:forwardedip:geo:region:<ISO
                               country code>-<ISO region code> and awswaf:for-
                               wardedip:geo:country:<ISO country code> .

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An array  of  two-character  country  codes
                                   that  you  want to match against, for exam-
                                   ple, [ "US", "CN"  ]  ,  from  the  alpha-2
                                   country  ISO codes of the ISO 3166 interna-
                                   tional standard.

                                   When you use a geo match statement just for
                                   the  region and country labels that it adds
                                   to requests, you still  have  to  supply  a
                                   country  code  for the rule to evaluate. In
                                   this case, you configure the rule  to  only
                                   count  matching requests, but it will still
                                   generate logging and count metrics for  any
                                   matches.  You  can  reduce  the logging and
                                   metrics that the rule produces by  specify-
                                   ing  a  country  that's  unlikely  to  be a
                                   source of traffic to your site.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You cannot use a rule group  ref-
                               erence statement inside another rule group. You
                               can only reference a rule group as a  top-level
                               statement  within  a  rule that you define in a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   Rules  in  the  referenced rule group whose
                                   actions are set to Count .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Instead  of  this  option,  use  RuleAc-
                                      tionOverrides . It accepts any valid ac-
                                      tion setting, including Count .

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count .

                                      NOTE:
                                          Instead of this option, use  RuleAc-
                                          tionOverrides . It accepts any valid
                                          action setting, including Count .

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                               RuleActionOverrides -> (list)
                                   Action  settings to use in the place of the
                                   rule actions that are configured inside the
                                   rule  group.  You  specify one override for
                                   each rule whose action you want to change.

                                   You can use overrides for testing, for  ex-
                                   ample  you can override all of rule actions
                                   to Count and  then  monitor  the  resulting
                                   count  metrics  to  understand how the rule
                                   group would handle your  web  traffic.  You
                                   can  also  permanently override some or all
                                   actions, to modify how the rule group  man-
                                   ages your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Action  setting to use in the place of a
                                      rule action that  is  configured  inside
                                      the rule group. You specify one override
                                      for each rule whose action you  want  to
                                      change.

                                      You  can  use overrides for testing, for

                                      traffic. You can also permanently  over-
                                      ride  some or all actions, to modify how
                                      the rule group manages your web traffic.

                                                           x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the
                                                           custom header.

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-
                                      ToMatch setting.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-
                                          fig  ,  for  additional   processing
                                          fees.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            body  contents normally, according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          You   can   combine   the  MATCH  or
                                          NO_MATCH settings for oversize  han-
                                          dling with your rule and web ACL ac-
                                          tion settings, so that you block any
                                          request   whose  body  is  over  the
                                          limit.

                                          Default: CONTINUE

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-
                                      ciationConfig , for additional  process-
                                      ing fees.

                                      For  information  about  how  to  handle
                                      oversized request bodies, see the  Json-
                                      Body object configuration.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192

                                          fees.

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                      Inspect  the  request  headers. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Headers object, to define
                                      the set of headers to and the  parts  of
                                      the headers that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's headers and only the first 200

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define

                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-

                                   HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a string containing the list of
                                      the request's header names,  ordered  as

                                      receives for inspection.  WAF  generates
                                      the  string  and  then  uses that as the

                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                                      Match  against the request's JA3 finger-
                                      print header. The header contains a hash
                                      fingerprint  of  the  TLS  Client  Hello
                                      packet for the request.

                                      NOTE:
                                          You can use this choice only with  a
                                          string match ByteMatchStatement with
                                          the PositionalConstraint set to  EX-
                                          ACTLY .

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a JA3 fingerprint.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. Text transformations are used in rule
                                   match  statements,  to transform the Field-
                                   ToMatch request component before inspecting
                                   it,  and  they're  used  in rate-based rule
                                   statements, to transform request components
                                   before  using  them  as  custom aggregation
                                   keys. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  to  apply, WAF performs all trans-
                                   formations on the specified content, start-
                                   ing  from  the lowest priority setting, and
                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-
                                   tents.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations.  WAF
                                          processes all transformations,  from
                                          lowest  priority  to highest, before
                                          inspecting the transformed  content.
                                          The priorities don't need to be con-
                                          secutive, but they must all be  dif-
                                          ferent.

                                          For detailed descriptions of each of
                                          the transformation types,  see  Text
                                          transformations in the WAF Developer
                                          Guide .

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule counts incoming requests  and
                               rate  limits  requests  when they are coming at
                               too fast a rate. The rule categorizes  requests
                               according  to  your  aggregation criteria, col-
                               lects  them  into  aggregation  instances,  and
                               counts  and  rate  limits the requests for each
                               instance.

                               You can specify  individual  aggregation  keys,
                               like  IP  address  or HTTP method. You can also
                               specify aggregation key combinations,  like  IP
                               address  and HTTP method, or HTTP method, query
                               argument, and cookie.

                               Each unique set of values for  the  aggregation
                               keys that you specify is a separate aggregation
                               instance, with the value  from  each  key  con-
                               tributing  to  the aggregation instance defini-
                               tion.

                               For example, assume the rule evaluates web  re-
                               quests  with  the following IP address and HTTP
                               method values:

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               o IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST

                               o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET

                               The rule would create different aggregation in-
                               stances according to your aggregation criteria,
                               for example:

                               o If the aggregation criteria is  just  the  IP
                                 address,  then  each individual address is an
                                 aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
                                 separately  for  each.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances and request counts  for  our  example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1: count 3

                                 o IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1

                               o If  the  aggregation criteria is HTTP method,
                                 then each individual HTTP method is an aggre-
                                 gation  instance.  The  aggregation instances
                                 and request counts for our example  would  be
                                 the following:

                                 o HTTP method POST: count 2

                                 o HTTP method GET: count 2

                               o If the aggregation criteria is IP address and
                                 HTTP method, then each IP  address  and  each
                                 HTTP  method would contribute to the combined
                                 aggregation  instance.  The  aggregation  in-
                                 stances  and  request  counts for our example
                                 would be the following:

                                 o IP  address  10.1.1.1,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                                 o IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count
                                   2

                                 o IP address  127.0.0.0,  HTTP  method  POST:
                                   count 1

                               For  any  n-tuple  of  aggregation  keys,  each
                               unique combination of values for the  keys  de-
                               fines  a  separate  aggregation instance, which
                               WAF counts and rate-limits individually.

                               You can optionally nest another  statement  in-
                               side  the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the
                               scope of the rule so that it  only  counts  and
                               rate  limits  requests  that  match  the nested
                               statement. You can use this  nested  scope-down
                               statement  in conjunction with your aggregation
                               key specifications or you can  just  count  and
                               rate   limit   all   requests  that  match  the
                               scope-down statement, without additional aggre-
                               gation.  When you choose to just manage all re-
                               quests that match a scope-down  statement,  the
                               aggregation instance is singular for the rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               For  additional  information about the options,
                               see Rate limiting web requests using rate-based
                               rules in the WAF Developer Guide .

                               If  you only aggregate on the individual IP ad-
                               dress or forwarded IP address, you can retrieve
                               the  list of IP addresses that WAF is currently
                               rate limiting for a rule through the  API  call
                               GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys  . This option
                               is not available for other aggregation configu-
                               rations.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for  a  single aggregation instance for the
                                   rate-based rule. If the  rate-based  state-
                                   ment  includes  a ScopeDownStatement , this
                                   limit is applied only to the requests  that
                                   match the statement.

                                   Examples:

                                   o If  you aggregate on just the IP address,
                                     this is the limit on  requests  from  any
                                     single IP address.

                                   o If  you  aggregate on the HTTP method and
                                     the query argument name "city", then this
                                     is  the  limit on requests for any single
                                     method, city pair.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Web requests that are missing any of the
                                      components specified in the  aggregation
                                      keys  are  omitted  from  the rate-based
                                      rule evaluation and handling.

                                   o CONSTANT - Count and limit  the  requests
                                     that    match   the   rate-based   rule's
                                     scope-down statement. With  this  option,
                                     the  counted  requests aren't further ag-
                                     gregated. The scope-down statement is the
                                     only  specification  used. When the count
                                     of  all   requests   that   satisfy   the
                                     scope-down statement goes over the limit,
                                     WAF applies the rule action  to  all  re-
                                     quests that satisfy the scope-down state-
                                     ment.  With this option, you must config-
                                     ure the ScopeDownStatement property.

                                   o CUSTOM_KEYS   -   Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts using one or more web request com-
                                     ponents  as the aggregate keys. With this
                                     option, you must  specify  the  aggregate
                                     keys  in the CustomKeys property.  To ag-
                                     gregate on only the IP  address  or  only
                                     the  forwarded IP address, don't use cus-
                                     tom keys. Instead, set the aggregate  key
                                     type to IP or FORWARDED_IP .

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  With this option, you must spec-
                                     ify the header to use in the ForwardedIP-
                                     Config  property.  To aggregate on a com-
                                     bination of the forwarded IP address with
                                     other aggregate keys, use CUSTOM_KEYS .

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web  request  origin.
                                     To  aggregate  on a combination of the IP
                                     address with other  aggregate  keys,  use
                                     CUSTOM_KEYS .

                               (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if you specify a forwarded
                                   IP in the rule's aggregate key settings.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                               CustomKeys -> (list)
                                   Specifies the aggregate keys to  use  in  a
                                   rate-base rule.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single custom aggregate key
                                      for a rate-base rule.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Web requests that are missing any of
                                          the  components specified in the ag-
                                          gregation keys are omitted from  the
                                          rate-based  rule evaluation and han-

                                      Header -> (structure)
                                          Use the value of a header in the re-
                                          quest as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct value in the  header  contrib-
                                          utes to the aggregation instance. If
                                          you use a single header as your cus-
                                          tom  key,  then each value fully de-
                                          fines an aggregation instance.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the header to use.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text  transformations   eliminate
                                             some  of  the  unusual formatting

                                      HTTPMethod -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's HTTP method as  an
                                          aggregate  key.  Each  distinct HTTP
                                          method contributes to  the  aggrega-
                                          tion  instance.  If you use just the
                                          HTTP method as your custom key, then
                                          each  method fully defines an aggre-
                                          gation instance.

                                      ForwardedIP -> (structure)
                                          Use the first IP address in an  HTTP
                                          header  as  an  aggregate  key. Each
                                          distinct forwarded IP  address  con-
                                          tributes   to  the  aggregation  in-
                                          stance.

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded
                                          IP  in  the custom key settings, you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key  to  use.  You  can aggregate on
                                          only the  forwarded  IP  address  by
                                          specifying   FORWARDED_IP   in  your
                                          rate-based statement's AggregateKey-
                                          Type .

                                          With  this  option, you must specify
                                          the header to use in the  rate-based
                                          rule's ForwardedIPConfig property.

                                      IP -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's originating IP ad-
                                          dress as an aggregate key. Each dis-
                                          tinct  IP address contributes to the
                                          aggregation instance.

                                          When you specify an IP or  forwarded
                                          IP  in  the custom key settings, you
                                          must also specify at least one other
                                          key  to  use.  You  can aggregate on
                                          only the IP address by specifying IP
                                          in  your  rate-based statement's Ag-
                                          gregateKeyType .

                                      LabelNamespace -> (structure)
                                          Use the specified label namespace as
                                          an   aggregate  key.  Each  distinct
                                          fully qualified label name that  has
                                          the  specified  label namespace con-
                                          tributes  to  the  aggregation   in-
                                          stance.  If  you  use just one label
                                          namespace as your custom  key,  then
                                          each label name fully defines an ag-
                                          gregation instance.

                                          This uses only labels that have been
                                          added  to  the request by rules that
                                          are evaluated before this rate-based
                                          rule in the web ACL.

                                          For  information  about  label name-
                                          spaces and names, see  Label  syntax

                                          Namespace -> (string)
                                             The namespace to use for aggrega-
                                             tion.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Use the request's URI path as an ag-
                                          gregate key. Each distinct URI  path
                                          contributes  to  the aggregation in-
                                          stance. If you use just the URI path
                                          as  your  custom  key, then each URI
                                          path fully  defines  an  aggregation
                                          instance.

                                          TextTransformations -> (list)
                                             Text   transformations  eliminate
                                             some of  the  unusual  formatting

                                             used in rule match statements, to

                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify a rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                                                        Value -> (string)
                                                           The  value  of  the

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement to match against labels that
                               have been added to the  web  request  by  rules
                               that have already run in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space specifications  and  prefix  up  to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The  part  of the web request that you want
                                   WAF to inspect.

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Alternately, you can filter and  inspect
                                      all  headers  with  the  Headers  Field-

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of the web request that identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192
                                      bytes) and for CloudFront distributions,
                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if the body is
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire contents  of  the  web  request
                                          body  if  the body exceeds the limit
                                          for the resource type. If  the  body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The default limit  is  8  KB  (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16
                                          KB  (16,384  bytes)  for  CloudFront
                                          distributions.  For  CloudFront dis-
                                          tributions,  you  can  increase  the
                                          limit in the web ACL AssociationCon-

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available

                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      A limited amount of the request body  is
                                      forwarded  to  WAF for inspection by the
                                      underlying host  service.  For  regional
                                      resources,  the  limit  is  8  KB (8,192

                                      the  limit  is 16 KB (16,384 bytes). For
                                      CloudFront distributions,  you  can  in-
                                      crease  the limit in the web ACL's Asso-

                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  the  body  is
                                          larger  than  WAF  can  inspect. WAF
                                          does not support inspecting the  en-
                                          tire  contents  of  the  web request
                                          body if the body exceeds  the  limit
                                          for  the  resource type. If the body
                                          is larger than the limit, the under-
                                          lying host service only forwards the
                                          contents that are below the limit to
                                          WAF for inspection.

                                          The  default  limit  is  8 KB (8,192
                                          bytes) for regional resources and 16

                                          The options  for  oversize  handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the available
                                            body contents normally,  according
                                            to the rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          You  can  combine   the   MATCH   or
                                          NO_MATCH  settings for oversize han-

                                      request's headers and only the first 200
                                      headers are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size header content in the  Headers  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the headers that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the
                                          subset of headers to  inspect  in  a
                                          web request.

                                          You  must  specify  exactly one set-
                                          ting: either All , IncludedHeaders ,
                                          or ExcludedHeaders .

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Inspect all headers.

                                          IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                             Inspect  only  the  headers  that
                                             have a key that  matches  one  of

                                          with the rule  inspection  criteria.
                                          If  you  specify  All , WAF inspects
                                          both keys and values.

                                      OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if the headers of
                                          the  request  are  more  numerous or
                                          larger than  WAF  can  inspect.  WAF
                                          does  not support inspecting the en-
                                          tire  contents  of  request  headers
                                          when  they  exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                          or 200 total headers. The underlying
                                          host  service  forwards a maximum of
                                          200 headers and  at  most  8  KB  of
                                          header contents to WAF.

                                          The  options  for  oversize handling
                                          are the following:

                                          o CONTINUE - Inspect  the  available
                                            headers normally, according to the
                                            rule inspection criteria.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                   Cookies -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  cookies. You must
                                      configure  scope  and  pattern  matching
                                      filters in the Cookies object, to define
                                      the set of cookies and the parts of  the
                                      cookies that WAF inspects.

                                      Only  the  first  8 KB (8192 bytes) of a
                                      request's cookies and only the first 200
                                      cookies are forwarded to WAF for inspec-
                                      tion by the underlying host service. You
                                      must  configure  how to handle any over-
                                      size cookie content in the  Cookies  ob-
                                      ject.  WAF  applies the pattern matching
                                      filters to the cookies that it  receives
                                      from the underlying host service.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The  filter  to  use to identify the

                                   then uses the  transformed  component  con-

                                      application.  For  example,  for the URL
                                      https://example.com/web/login   ,    you
                                      would  provide the path /web/login . Lo-

                                      you  provide are considered a match. For
                                      example  /web/login  matches  the  login
                                      paths   /web/login   ,   /web/login/   ,
                                      /web/loginPage , and /web/login/thisPage

                                      group to track login failure rates.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Response   inspection  is  available
                                          only in web ACLs that protect Amazon
                                          CloudFront distributions.

                                      The  ATP  rule  group  evaluates the re-
                                      sponses that  your  protected  resources
                                      send  back  to  client  login  attempts,
                                      keeping count of successful  and  failed
                                      attempts  for each IP address and client
                                      session.  Using  this  information,  the
                                      rule group labels and mitigates requests
                                      from client sessions  and  IP  addresses
                                      that  have had too many failed login at-
                                      tempts in a short amount of time.

                                             counted  as  a  success,  the re-

                                                    header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                                 Value -> (string)
                                                    The value  of  the  custom
                                                    header.

                     LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  to  match against labels that have
                        been added to the web request by rules that  have  al-
                        ready run in the web ACL.

                        The  label match statement provides the label or name-
                        space string to search for. The label string can  rep-
                        resent a part or all of the fully qualified label name
                        that had been added to the web request.  Fully  quali-
                        fied  labels  have  a prefix, optional namespaces, and
                        label name. The prefix identifies the  rule  group  or
                        web  ACL  context of the rule that added the label. If
                        you do not provide the fully qualified  name  in  your
                        label match string, WAF performs the search for labels
                        that were added in the same context as the label match
                        statement.

                        Scope -> (string)
                            Specify  whether you want to match using the label
                            name or just the namespace.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The string to match against. The setting you  pro-
                            vide  for  this  depends  on the match statement's
                            Scope setting:

                            o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then this  speci-
                              fication  must  include the name and can include
                              any number of preceding namespace specifications
                              and  prefix  up to providing the fully qualified
                              label name.

                            o If the Scope indicates  NAMESPACE  ,  then  this
                              specification can include any number of contigu-
                              ous namespace strings, and can include  the  en-
                              tire  label namespace prefix from the rule group
                              or web ACL where the label originates.

                            Labels are case sensitive and components of a  la-
                            bel  must  be  separated  by  colon,  for  example
                            NS1:NS2:name .

                     RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for a match against a single regular expression.

                        RegexString -> (string)
                            The string representing the regular expression.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The  part  of the web request that you want WAF to
                            inspect.

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Alternately,  you  can  filter  and inspect all
                               headers with the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  the web request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the Body object  configura-
                               tion.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               A limited amount of the request  body  is  for-
                               warded  to WAF for inspection by the underlying
                               host service. For regional resources, the limit
                               is  8  KB (8,192 bytes) and for CloudFront dis-
                               tributions, the limit is 16 KB (16,384  bytes).
                               For  CloudFront distributions, you can increase
                               the limit in the web ACL's AssociationConfig  ,
                               for additional processing fees.

                               For  information  about how to handle oversized
                               request bodies, see the JsonBody object config-
                               uration.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the body is larger
                                   than WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support
                                   inspecting  the  entire contents of the web
                                   request body if the body exceeds the  limit
                                   for  the  resource  type.  If  the  body is
                                   larger than the limit, the underlying  host
                                   service only forwards the contents that are
                                   below the limit to WAF for inspection.

                                   The default limit is 8 KB (8,192 bytes) for
                                   regional resources and 16 KB (16,384 bytes)
                                   for CloudFront  distributions.  For  Cloud-
                                   Front  distributions,  you can increase the
                                   limit in the web  ACL  AssociationConfig  ,
                                   for additional processing fees.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE -  Inspect  the  available  body
                                     contents  normally, according to the rule
                                     inspection criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   You  can combine the MATCH or NO_MATCH set-
                                   tings for oversize handling with your  rule
                                   and  web  ACL  action settings, so that you
                                   block any request whose body  is  over  the
                                   limit.

                                   Default: CONTINUE

                            Headers -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request headers. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Head-
                               ers object, to define the set of headers to and
                               the parts of the headers that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               headers and only the first 200 headers are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize header content in the Headers  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the headers that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   headers to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-
                                   ther  All  , IncludedHeaders , or Excluded-
                                   Headers .

                                   Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "Excluded-
                                   Headers":   [   "KeyToExclude1",  "KeyToEx-
                                   clude2" ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all headers.

                                   IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the headers that have a key
                                      that  matches  one of the strings speci-
                                      fied here.

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  headers  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the headers to match with  the
                                   rule  inspection  criteria.  If you specify
                                   All , WAF inspects both keys and values.

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            Cookies -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request cookies. You must configure
                               scope and pattern matching filters in the Cook-
                               ies  object,  to  define the set of cookies and
                               the parts of the cookies that WAF inspects.

                               Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's
                               cookies and only the first 200 cookies are for-
                               warded to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                               host  service. You must configure how to handle
                               any oversize cookie content in the Cookies  ob-
                               ject.  WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                               to the cookies that it receives from the under-
                               lying host service.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The filter to use to identify the subset of
                                   cookies to inspect in a web request.

                                   You must specify exactly one  setting:  ei-
                                   ther  All  , IncludedCookies , or Excluded-
                                   Cookies .

                                   Example JSON: "MatchPattern": {  "Included-
                                   Cookies": [ "session-id-time", "session-id"
                                   ] }

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all cookies.

                                   IncludedCookies -> (list)
                                      Inspect only the cookies that have a key
                                      that  matches  one of the strings speci-

                                      (string)

                                   ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                                      Inspect  only  the  cookies  whose  keys
                                      don't match any of the strings specified
                                      here.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the cookies  to  inspect  with
                                   the  rule inspection criteria. If you spec-

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do if the cookies of the
                                   request are more numerous  or  larger  than
                                   WAF  can  inspect. WAF does not support in-
                                   specting the  entire  contents  of  request
                                   cookies  when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes)
                                   or 200 total cookies. The  underlying  host
                                   service  forwards  a maximum of 200 cookies
                                   and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                                   The options for oversize handling  are  the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE  - Inspect the available cookies
                                     normally, according to the  rule  inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            HeaderOrder -> (structure)
                               Inspect a string containing the list of the re-
                               quest's header names, ordered as they appear in
                               the web request that WAF receives  for  inspec-
                               tion.  WAF  generates  the string and then uses
                               that as the field to match component in its in-
                               spection. WAF separates the header names in the
                               string using colons and no  added  spaces,  for
                               example       host:user-agent:accept:authoriza-
                               tion:referer .

                               OversizeHandling -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do if the  headers  of  the
                                   request  are  more  numerous or larger than
                                   WAF can inspect. WAF does not  support  in-
                                   specting  the  entire  contents  of request
                                   headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192  bytes)
                                   or  200  total headers. The underlying host
                                   service forwards a maximum of  200  headers
                                   and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                                   The  options  for oversize handling are the
                                   following:

                                   o CONTINUE - Inspect the available  headers
                                     normally,  according  to the rule inspec-
                                     tion criteria.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                            JA3Fingerprint -> (structure)
                               Match  against  the  request's  JA3 fingerprint
                               header. The header contains a hash  fingerprint
                               of the TLS Client Hello packet for the request.

                               NOTE:
                                   You  can use this choice only with a string
                                   match ByteMatchStatement with the Position-
                                   alConstraint set to EXACTLY .

                               FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   The  match  status to assign to the web re-
                                   quest if the request  doesn't  have  a  JA3
                                   fingerprint.

                                   You  can specify the following fallback be-
                                   haviors:

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort  to  bypass detection. Text transforma-
                            tions are used in rule match statements, to trans-
                            form the FieldToMatch request component before in-
                            specting it, and they're used in  rate-based  rule
                            statements, to transform request components before
                            using them as  custom  aggregation  keys.  If  you
                            specify  one or more transformations to apply, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the specified con-
                            tent,  starting  from the lowest priority setting,
                            and then uses the transformed component contents.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations.  WAF  processes all
                                   transformations, from  lowest  priority  to
                                   highest,  before inspecting the transformed
                                   content. The priorities don't  need  to  be
                                   consecutive,  but  they must all be differ-
                                   ent.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   For detailed descriptions of  each  of  the
                                   transformation  types, see Text transforma-
                                   tions in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 Action -> (structure)
                     The action that WAF should take on a web request when  it
                     matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level
                     can override the rule action setting.

                     This is used only for rules whose statements do not  ref-
                     erence  a  rule  group.  Rule statements that reference a
                     rule group include RuleGroupReferenceStatement  and  Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     You  must  specify either this Action setting or the rule
                     OverrideAction setting, but not both:

                     o If the rule statement does not reference a rule  group,
                       use  this rule action setting and not the rule override
                       action setting.

                     o If the rule statement references a rule group, use  the
                       override action setting and not this action setting.

                     Block -> (structure)
                        Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                        CustomResponse -> (structure)
                            Defines a custom response for the web request.

                            For information about customizing web requests and
                            responses, see Customizing web  requests  and  re-
                            sponses in WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            ResponseCode -> (integer)
                               The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                               For  a list of status codes that you can use in
                               your custom  responses,  see  Supported  status
                               codes  for custom response in the WAF Developer
                               Guide .

                            CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                               References the response body that you want  WAF
                               to  return  to  the web request client. You can
                               define a custom response for a rule action or a
                               default web ACL action that is set to block. To
                               do this, you first define the response body key
                               and  value  in the CustomResponseBodies setting
                               for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to
                               use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL de-
                               fault action BlockAction setting, you reference
                               the response body using this key.

                            ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                               The  HTTP  headers  to use in the response. You
                               can specify any header  name  except  for  con-
                               tent-type  . Duplicate header names are not al-
                               lowed.

                               (structure)
                                   A custom header for custom request and  re-
                                   sponse handling. This is used in  CustomRe-
                                   sponse and  CustomRequestHandling .

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,
                                      when WAF inserts the header into the re-
                                      quest, it prefixes this name x-amzn-waf-
                                      ,  to  avoid  confusion with the headers
                                      that are already in the request. For ex-
                                      ample,  for the header name sample , WAF
                                      inserts the header x-amzn-waf-sample .

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     Allow -> (structure)
                        Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     The action to use in the place of the action that results
                     from  the  rule group evaluation. Set the override action
                     to none to leave the result of the rule group alone.  Set
                     it to count to override the result to count only.

                     You  can only use this for rule statements that reference
                     a rule group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement  and  Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If  you
                        want  the  rules  in  the  rule  group  to  only count
                        matches, do not use this and instead use the rule  ac-

                            use  the  rule  action override option, with Count
                            action, in your  rule  group  reference  statement
                            settings.

                                      The name of the custom header.

                                      For  custom  request  header  insertion,

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of the custom header.

                     None -> (structure)
                        Don't override the rule group evaluation result.  This
                        is the most common setting.

                 RuleLabels -> (list)
                     Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match
                     statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching
                     web  requests.  A fully qualified label is the concatena-
                     tion of a label namespace and a rule  label.  The  rule's
                     rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

                     Rules  that  run after this rule in the web ACL can match
                     against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement .

                     For each label, provide a case-sensitive string  contain-
                     ing  optional  namespaces  and a label name, according to
                     the following guidelines:

                     o Separate each component of the label with a colon.

                     o Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

                     o You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.

                     o Don't use the following reserved words  in  your  label
                       specification: aws , waf , managed , rulegroup , webacl
                       , regexpatternset , or ipset .

                     For example, myLabelName  or  nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLa-
                     belName .

                     (structure)
                        A  single  label container. This is used as an element
                        of a label array in multiple contexts, for example, in
                        RuleLabels inside a  Rule and in Labels inside a  Sam-
                        pledHTTPRequest .

                        Name -> (string)
                            The label string.

                 VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
                     Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web re-
                     quest sample collection.

                     If  you change the name of a Rule after you create it and
                     you want the rule's metric name to  reflect  the  change,
                     update the metric name as well. WAF doesn't automatically
                     update the metric name.

                     SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether WAF should store a sampling  of  the
                        web  requests  that  match the rules. You can view the
                        sampled requests through the WAF console.

                     CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the associated resource  sends  met-
                        rics  to  Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available
                        metrics, see WAF Metrics in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        For web ACLs, the metrics are for  web  requests  that
                        have  the  web ACL default action applied. WAF applies
                        the default action to web requests that pass  the  in-
                        spection of all rules in the web ACL without being ei-
                        ther allowed or blocked. For more information, see The
                        web ACL default action in the WAF Developer Guide .

                     MetricName -> (string)
                        A  name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The
                        name can contain only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, -
                        (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one
                        to 128 characters long. It can't contain whitespace or
                        metric  names  that  are reserved for WAF, for example
                        All and Default_Action .

                 CaptchaConfig -> (structure)
                     Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA  evaluations.  If
                     you  don't  specify this, WAF uses the CAPTCHA configura-
                     tion that's defined for the web ACL.

                     ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                        Determines how long a CAPTCHA timestamp in  the  token
                        remains  valid  after the client successfully solves a
                        CAPTCHA puzzle.

                        ImmunityTime -> (long)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA  or
                            challenge  timestamp  is  considered valid by WAF.
                            The default setting is 300.

                            For the Challenge action, the minimum  setting  is
                            300.

                 ChallengeConfig -> (structure)
                     Specifies how WAF should handle Challenge evaluations. If
                     you don't specify this, WAF uses the challenge configura-
                     tion that's defined for the web ACL.

                     ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                        Determines how long a challenge timestamp in the token
                        remains valid after the client  successfully  responds
                        to a challenge.

                        ImmunityTime -> (long)
                            The  amount of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA or
                            challenge timestamp is considered  valid  by  WAF.
                            The default setting is 300.

                            For  the  Challenge action, the minimum setting is
                            300.

          VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
              Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics  and  web  request
              sample collection.

              SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether WAF should store a sampling of the web re-
                 quests that match the rules. You can  view  the  sampled  re-
                 quests through the WAF console.

              CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  associated resource sends metrics to
                 Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics, see WAF
                 Metrics in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 For  web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that have the
                 web ACL default action applied. WAF applies the  default  ac-
                 tion to web requests that pass the inspection of all rules in
                 the web ACL without being either allowed or blocked. For more
                 information, see The web ACL default action in the WAF Devel-
                 oper Guide .

              MetricName -> (string)
                 A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric  dimension.  The  name
                 can  contain  only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen),
                 and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to  128  charac-
                 ters  long.  It can't contain whitespace or metric names that
                 are reserved for WAF, for example All and Default_Action .

          LabelNamespace -> (string)
              The label namespace prefix for this rule group. All labels added
              by rules in this rule group have this prefix.

              o The syntax for the label namespace prefix for your rule groups
                is the following:   awswaf:<account ID>:rulegroup:<rule  group
                name>:

              o When  a  rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the
                fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified  label
                is  made  up of the label namespace from the rule group or web
                ACL where the rule is defined and the  label  from  the  rule,
                separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from rule>

          CustomResponseBodies -> (map)
              A  map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you cre-
              ate a rule with a block action, you can send a  custom  response
              to  the  web  request.  You define these for the rule group, and
              then use them in the rules that you define in the rule group.

              For information about customizing web  requests  and  responses,
              see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the WAF De-
              veloper Guide .

              For information about the limits on count and  size  for  custom
              request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in the WAF Devel-
              oper Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The response body to use in a custom response to  a  web  re-
                 quest.  This  is referenced by key from  CustomResponse  Cus-
                 tomResponseBodyKey .

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     The type of content in the payload that you are  defining
                     in the Content string.

                 Content -> (string)
                     The payload of the custom response.

                     You  can  use  JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do
                     this, you must specify JSON content  in  the  ContentType
                     setting.

                     For  information  about  the limits on count and size for
                     custom request and response settings, see WAF  quotas  in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

          AvailableLabels -> (list)
              The  labels  that  one  or  more rules in this rule group add to
              matching web requests. These labels are defined in  the  RuleLa-
              bels for a  Rule .

              (structure)
                 List  of  labels used by one or more of the rules of a  Rule-
                 Group . This summary object is used for  the  following  rule
                 group lists:

                 o AvailableLabels  -  Labels  that  rules add to matching re-
                   quests. These labels are defined in the  RuleLabels  for  a
                   Rule .

                 o ConsumedLabels - Labels that rules match against. These la-
                   bels are defined in a LabelMatchStatement specification, in
                   the  Statement definition of a rule.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An individual label specification.

          ConsumedLabels -> (list)
              The  labels  that  one  or  more  rules in this rule group match
              against in label match statements. These labels are defined in a
              LabelMatchStatement  specification, in the  Statement definition
              of a rule.

              (structure)
                 List of labels used by one or more of the rules of  a   Rule-
                 Group  .  This  summary object is used for the following rule
                 group lists:

                 o AvailableLabels - Labels that rules  add  to  matching  re-
                   quests.  These  labels  are defined in the RuleLabels for a
                   Rule .

                 o ConsumedLabels - Labels that rules match against. These la-
                   bels are defined in a LabelMatchStatement specification, in
                   the  Statement definition of a rule.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An individual label specification.

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.
