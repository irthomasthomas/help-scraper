LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()                              LIST-TAGS-FOR-RESOURCE()



NAME
       list-tags-for-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  TagInfoForResource for the specified resource. Tags are
       key:value pairs that you can use to  categorize  and  manage  your  re-
       sources,  for purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag
       key to "customer" and the value to the customer name  or  ID.  You  can
       specify  one  or more tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource,
       up to 50 tags for a resource.

       You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you  manage  through
       WAF:  web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and regex pattern sets. You can't
       manage or view tags through the WAF console.

OPTIONS
       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve all tags for an AWS WAF resource

       The following list-tags-for-resource retrieves the list of all tag key,
       value pairs for the specified web ACL.

          aws wafv2 list-tags-for-resource \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/testwebacl2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "NextMarker":"",
              "TagInfoForResource":{
                  "ResourceARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/testwebacl2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "TagList":[

                  ]
              }
          }

       For more information, see Getting Started with AWS WAF in the AWS  WAF,
       AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       TagInfoForResource -> (structure)
          The collection of tagging definitions for the resource. If you spec-
          ified a Limit in your request, this might not be the full list.

          ResourceARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.

          TagList -> (list)
              The array of  Tag objects defined for the resource.

              (structure)
                 A tag associated with an Amazon Web Services  resource.  Tags
                 are key:value pairs that you can use to categorize and manage
                 your resources, for purposes like billing  or  other  manage-
                 ment.  Typically,  the tag key represents a category, such as
                 "environment", and the tag value represents a specific  value
                 within that category, such as "test," "development," or "pro-
                 duction". Or you might set the tag key to "customer" and  the
                 value to the customer name or ID. You can specify one or more
                 tags to add to each Amazon Web Services resource,  up  to  50
                 tags for a resource.

                 You can tag the Amazon Web Services resources that you manage
                 through WAF: web ACLs, rule groups, IP sets, and  regex  pat-
                 tern sets. You can't manage or view tags through the WAF con-
                 sole.

                 Key -> (string)
                     Part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                     use a tag key to describe a category of information, such
                     as "customer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Part of the key:value pair that defines a  tag.  You  can
                     use  a  tag  value  to describe a specific value within a
                     category, such as "companyA" or  "companyB."  Tag  values
                     are case-sensitive.
