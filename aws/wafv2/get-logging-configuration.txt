            get-logging-configuration
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL for which you want to
          get the  LoggingConfiguration .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the logging configurations for a web ACL

       The following get-logging-configuration retrieves the logging  configu-
       ration for the specified web ACL.

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  LoggingConfiguration for the specified web ACL.

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you  want  to
              associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              The logging destination configuration that you want to associate
              with the web ACL.

              NOTE:
                 You can associate one logging destination to a web ACL.

              (string)

          RedactedFields -> (list)
              The parts of the request that you want to keep out of the  logs.
              For  example,  if  you redact the SingleHeader field, the HEADER
              field in the logs will be REDACTED .

              NOTE:
                 You can specify only the following fields for redaction: Uri-
                 Path , QueryString , SingleHeader , Method , and JsonBody .

              (structure)
                 The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect. In-
                 clude the single FieldToMatch type that you want to  inspect,
                 with  additional  specifications  as needed, according to the
                 type. You specify a single request component in  FieldToMatch
                 for  each  rule  statement  that requires it. To inspect more
                 than one component of the web request, create a separate rule
                 statement for each component.

                 Example JSON for a QueryString field to match:
                     "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }

                 Example JSON for a Method field to match specification:
                     "FieldToMatch": { "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                 SingleHeader -> (structure)
                     Inspect  a  single header. Provide the name of the header
                     to inspect, for example, User-Agent  or  Referer  .  This
                     setting isn't case sensitive.

                     Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }

                     Alternately,  you can filter and inspect all headers with
                     the Headers  FieldToMatch setting.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the query header to inspect.

                 SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                     Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of  the
                     query  argument  to inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                     gion . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isn't
                     case sensitive.

                     Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name": "myArgu-
                     ment" }

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the query argument to inspect.

                 AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                     Inspect all query arguments.

                 UriPath -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request URI path. This is the part of the web
                     request  that  identifies  a  resource, for example, /im-
                     ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                 QueryString -> (structure)
                     Inspect the query string. This is the part of a URL  that
                     appears after a ? character, if any.

                 Body -> (structure)
                     Inspect  the request body as plain text. The request body
                     immediately follows the request headers. This is the part
                     of  a  request that contains any additional data that you
                     want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body,
                     such as data from a form.

                     Only  the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body are
                     forwarded to WAF for inspection by  the  underlying  host
                     service.  For  information  about how to handle oversized
                     request bodies, see the Body object configuration.

                     OversizeHandling -> (string)
                        What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF  can
                        inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the entire
                        contents of the body of a web request  when  the  body
                        exceeds  8 KB (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the
                        request body are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying
                        host service.

                        The options for oversize handling are the following:

                        o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body normally, according to
                          the rule inspection criteria.

                        o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching  the  rule
                          statement.  WAF  applies  the rule action to the re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

                        You  can  combine  the  MATCH or NO_MATCH settings for
                        oversize handling with your rule and  web  ACL  action
                        settings,  so that you block any request whose body is
                        over 8 KB.

                        Default: CONTINUE

                 Method -> (structure)
                     Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of
                     operation  that  the request is asking the origin to per-
                     form.

                 JsonBody -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body  imme-
                     diately  follows the request headers. This is the part of
                     a request that contains any additional data that you want
                     to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such
                     as data from a form.

                     Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request body  are
                     forwarded  to  WAF  for inspection by the underlying host
                     service. For information about how  to  handle  oversized
                     request bodies, see the JsonBody object configuration.

                     MatchPattern -> (structure)
                        The  patterns  to  look  for in the JSON body. WAF in-
                        spects the results of these  pattern  matches  against
                        the rule inspection criteria.

                        All -> (structure)
                            Match  all of the elements. See also MatchScope in
                            JsonBody .

                            You must specify either this setting  or  the  In-
                            cludedPaths setting, but not both.

                        IncludedPaths -> (list)
                            Match  only  the specified include paths. See also
                            MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                            Provide the include paths using JSON Pointer  syn-
                            tax.       For      example,      "IncludedPaths":
                            ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                            about  this  syntax,  see the Internet Engineering
                            Task Force (IETF) documentation JavaScript  Object
                            Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                            You  must  specify  either this setting or the All
                            setting, but not both.

                            NOTE:
                               Don't use this option to include all paths. In-
                               stead, use the All setting.

                            (string)

                     MatchScope -> (string)
                        The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match against using the
                        MatchPattern .  If  you  specify  All  ,  WAF  matches
                        against keys and values.

                     InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                        What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the
                        JSON body. The options are the following:

                        o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body as plain text.
                          WAF  applies the text transformations and inspection
                          criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to
                          the body text string.

                        o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as matching the rule
                          statement. WAF applies the rule action  to  the  re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

                        If you don't provide  this  setting,  WAF  parses  and
                        evaluates  the  content  only  up to the first parsing
                        failure that it encounters.

                        WAF does its best to parse the entire JSON  body,  but
                        might  be  forced  to stop for reasons such as invalid
                        characters, duplicate keys, truncation, and  any  con-
                        tent whose root node isn't an object or an array.

                        WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples as two
                        valid key, value pairs:

                        o Missing comma: {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                        o Missing colon: {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                        o Extra colons: {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                     OversizeHandling -> (string)
                        What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF  can
                        inspect.  WAF  does  not support inspecting the entire
                        contents of the body of a web request  when  the  body
                        exceeds  8 KB (8192 bytes). Only the first 8 KB of the
                        request body are forwarded to WAF  by  the  underlying
                        host service.

                        The options for oversize handling are the following:

                        o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the body normally, according to
                          the rule inspection criteria.

                        o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching  the  rule
                          statement.  WAF  applies  the rule action to the re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

                        You  can  combine  the  MATCH or NO_MATCH settings for
                        oversize handling with your rule and  web  ACL  action
                        settings,  so that you block any request whose body is
                        over 8 KB.

                        Default: CONTINUE

                 Headers -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request headers. You must configure scope and
                     pattern matching filters in the Headers object, to define
                     the set of headers to and the parts of the  headers  that
                     WAF inspects.

                     Only  the  first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a request's headers
                     and only the first 200 headers are forwarded to  WAF  for
                     inspection  by the underlying host service. You must con-
                     figure how to handle any oversize header content  in  the
                     Headers  object. WAF applies the pattern matching filters
                     to the headers that it receives from the underlying  host
                     service.

                     MatchPattern -> (structure)
                        The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to
                        inspect in a web request.

                        You must specify exactly one setting: either All , In-
                        cludedHeaders , or ExcludedHeaders .

                        Example  JSON:  "MatchPattern":  {  "ExcludedHeaders":
                        {"KeyToExclude1", "KeyToExclude2"} }

                        All -> (structure)
                            Inspect all headers.

                        IncludedHeaders -> (list)
                            Inspect only the headers  that  have  a  key  that
                            matches one of the strings specified here.

                            (string)

                        ExcludedHeaders -> (list)
                            Inspect  only  the  headers whose keys don't match
                            any of the strings specified here.

                            (string)

                     MatchScope -> (string)
                        The parts of the headers to match with  the  rule  in-
                        spection  criteria.  If you specify All , WAF inspects
                        both keys and values.

                     OversizeHandling -> (string)
                        What WAF should do if the headers of the  request  are
                        larger  than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support in-
                        specting the entire contents of request  headers  when
                        they  exceed  8  KB (8192 bytes) or 200 total headers.
                        The underlying host service forwards a maximum of  200
                        headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

                        The options for oversize handling are the following:

                        o CONTINUE  -  Inspect the headers normally, according
                          to the rule inspection criteria.

                        o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching  the  rule
                          statement.  WAF  applies  the rule action to the re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

                 Cookies -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request cookies. You must configure scope and
                     pattern matching filters in the Cookies object, to define
                     the  set of cookies and the parts of the cookies that WAF
                     inspects.

                     Only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of a  request's  cookies
                     and  only  the first 200 cookies are forwarded to WAF for
                     inspection by the underlying host service. You must  con-
                     figure  how  to handle any oversize cookie content in the
                     Cookies object. WAF applies the pattern matching  filters
                     to  the cookies that it receives from the underlying host
                     service.

                     MatchPattern -> (structure)
                        The filter to use to identify the subset of cookies to
                        inspect in a web request.

                        You must specify exactly one setting: either All , In-
                        cludedCookies , or ExcludedCookies .

                        Example  JSON:  "MatchPattern":  {  "IncludedCookies":
                        {"KeyToInclude1", "KeyToInclude2", "KeyToInclude3"} }

                        All -> (structure)
                            Inspect all cookies.

                        IncludedCookies -> (list)
                            Inspect  only  the  cookies  that  have a key that
                            matches one of the strings specified here.

                            (string)

                        ExcludedCookies -> (list)
                            Inspect only the cookies whose  keys  don't  match
                            any of the strings specified here.

                            (string)

                     MatchScope -> (string)
                        The  parts of the cookies to inspect with the rule in-
                        spection criteria. If you specify All ,  WAF  inspects
                        both keys and values.

                     OversizeHandling -> (string)
                        What  WAF  should do if the cookies of the request are
                        larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support  in-
                        specting  the  entire contents of request cookies when
                        they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or  200  total  cookies.
                        The  underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200
                        cookies and at most 8 KB of cookie contents to WAF.

                        The options for oversize handling are the following:

                        o CONTINUE - Inspect the cookies  normally,  according
                          to the rule inspection criteria.

                        o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as matching the rule
                          statement. WAF applies the rule action  to  the  re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

          ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the logging configuration was created by Fire-
              wall  Manager,  as part of an WAF policy configuration. If true,
              only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configuration.

          LoggingFilter -> (structure)
              Filtering that specifies which web requests are kept in the logs
              and  which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action and on
              the web request labels that were applied by matching rules  dur-
              ing web ACL evaluation.

              Filters -> (list)
                 The filters that you want to apply to the logs.

                 (structure)
                     A single logging filter, used in  LoggingFilter .

                     Behavior -> (string)
                        How  to  handle  logs that satisfy the filter's condi-
                        tions and requirement.

                     Requirement -> (string)
                        Logic to apply to the filtering  conditions.  You  can
                        specify  that,  in  order to satisfy the filter, a log
                        must match all conditions or must match at  least  one
                        condition.

                     Conditions -> (list)
                        Match conditions for the filter.

                        (structure)
                            A single match condition for a  Filter .

                            ActionCondition -> (structure)
                               A  single  action condition. This is the action
                               setting that a log record must contain in order
                               to meet the condition.

                               Action -> (string)
                                   The  action  setting that a log record must
                                   contain in order  to  meet  the  condition.
                                   This  is the action that WAF applied to the
                                   web request.

                                   For rule groups, this is either the config-
                                   ured  rule action setting, or if you've ap-
                                   plied a rule action override to  the  rule,
                                   it's  the  override  action.  The value EX-
                                   CLUDED_AS_COUNT matches on  excluded  rules
                                   and  also  on rules that have a rule action
                                   override of Count.

                            LabelNameCondition -> (structure)
                               A single label  name  condition.  This  is  the
                               fully  qualified  label  name that a log record
                               must contain in order to  meet  the  condition.
                               Fully  qualified labels have a prefix, optional
                               namespaces, and label name. The prefix  identi-
                               fies  the  rule group or web ACL context of the
                               rule that added the label.

                               LabelName -> (string)
                                   The label name that a log record must  con-
                                   tain  in  order to meet the condition. This
                                   must be a fully qualified label name. Fully
                                   qualified  labels  have  a prefix, optional
                                   namespaces,  and  label  name.  The  prefix
                                   identifies  the  rule group or web ACL con-
                                   text of the rule that added the label.

              DefaultBehavior -> (string)
                 Default handling for logs that don't match any of the  speci-
                 fied filtering conditions.
