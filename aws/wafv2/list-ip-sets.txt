OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner ser-
          vice.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of IP sets

       The  following  list-ip-sets retrieves all IP sets for the account that
       have regional scope.

          aws wafv2 list-ip-sets \
              --scope REGIONAL

       Output:

          {
              "IPSets":[
                  {
                      "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/ipset/testip/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Description":"",
                      "Name":"testip",
                      "LockToken":"0674c84b-0304-47fe-8728-c6bff46af8fc",
                      "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111  "
                  }
              ],
              "NextMarker":"testip"
          }

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       IPSets -> (list)
          Array  of  IPSets.  This may not be the full list of IPSets that you
          have defined. See the Limit specification for this request.

          (structure)
              High-level information about an  IPSet , returned by  operations
              like  create  and  list.  This provides information like the ID,
              that you can use to retrieve and manage an IPSet , and the  ARN,
              that  you provide to the  IPSetReferenceStatement to use the ad-
              dress set in a  Rule .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the IP set. You cannot  change  the  name  of  an
                 IPSet after you create it.

              Id -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the
                 responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  op-
                 erations like update and delete.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

              LockToken -> (string)
                 A  token  used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to
                 your get and list requests, to mark the state of  the  entity
                 at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity as-
                 sociated with the token, you provide the token to  operations
                 like update and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no
                 changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved
                 it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOp-
                 timisticLockException . If this happens, perform another  get
                 , and use the new token returned by that operation.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
