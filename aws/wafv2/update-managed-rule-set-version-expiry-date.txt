UPDATE-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSION-EUPDATE-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSION-EXPIRY-DATE()



NAME
       update-managed-rule-set-version-expiry-date -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the expiration information for your managed rule set. Use this
       to initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version.  After  you
       initiate expiration for a version, WAF excludes it from the response to
       ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions for the managed rule group.

       NOTE:
          This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets.  Ven-
          dors  are  Amazon  Web  Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers. The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet ,  Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an App-
          Sync GraphQL API, a Amazon Cognito user pool, or an App Runner  ser-
          vice.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in
          the responses to commands like list . You provide it  to  operations
          like get and update .

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.

       --version-to-expire (string)
          The  version that you want to remove from your list of offerings for
          the named managed rule group.

       --expiry-timestamp (timestamp)
          The time that you want the version to expire.

          Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format in-
          cludes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ExpiringVersion -> (string)
          The version that is set to expire.

       ExpiryTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time that the version will expire.

          Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format in-
          cludes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
