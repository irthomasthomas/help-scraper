NAME
       get-managed-rule-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified managed rule set.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the  rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync  GraphQL  API,  an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner ser-
          vice, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned  in
          the  responses  to commands like list . You provide it to operations
          like get and update .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

          The managed rule set that you requested.

          Name -> (string)

              rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

              This name is assigned to the corresponding managed  rule  group,
              which your customers can access and use.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned
              in the responses to commands like list . You provide it to oper-
              ations like get and update .

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the set that helps with identification.

          PublishedVersions -> (map)
              The versions of this managed rule set that are available for use
              by customers.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Information for a single version of a managed rule set.

                 NOTE:
                     This is intended for use only by vendors of managed  rule
                     sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Marketplace sellers.

                     Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide
                     controlled  rollout  of your versioned managed rule group
                     offerings for your customers. The  APIs  are  ListManage-
                     dRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , PutManagedRuleSetVersions
                     , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

                 AssociatedRuleGroupArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vendor  rule  group
                     that's  used to define the published version of your man-
                     aged rule group.

                 Capacity -> (long)
                     The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this  rule
                     group.

                     WAF  uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating re-
                     sources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and
                     web  ACLs.  WAF  calculates capacity differently for each
                     rule type, to reflect the relative  cost  of  each  rule.
                     Simple  rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than
                     more complex rules that use more processing  power.  Rule
                     group  capacity  is  fixed at creation, which helps users
                     plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule  group.
                     For  more  information,  see  WAF  web ACL capacity units
                     (WCU) in the WAF Developer Guide .

                 ForecastedLifetime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time you expect this version of  your  man-
                     aged rule group to last, in days.

                 PublishTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time that you first published this version.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

                 LastUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The last time that you updated this version.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

                 ExpiryTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The time that this version is set to expire.

                     Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC
                     format includes the special designator, Z.  For  example,
                     "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

          RecommendedVersion -> (string)
              The version that you would like your customers to use.

          LabelNamespace -> (string)
              The  label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are
              offered to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that
              are added by rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

              o The  syntax  for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule
                group is the following:   awswaf:managed:<vendor>:<rule  group
                name> :

              o When  a  rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the
                fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified  label
                is  made  up of the label namespace from the rule group or web
                ACL where the rule is defined and the  label  from  the  rule,
                separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from rule>

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
