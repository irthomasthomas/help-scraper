DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Web  Services Single Sign On Portal is a web service that makes
       it easy for you to assign user access to Amazon Web  Services  SSO  re-
       sources  such  as  the AWS access portal. Users can get Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account applications and roles assigned to them and get federated
       into the application.

       NOTE:
          Although Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and
          identitystore API namespaces will continue to retain their  original
          name  for backward compatibility purposes. For more information, see
          Amazon Web Services SSO rename .

       This API reference guide describes the Amazon Web Services  SSO  Portal
       operations  that you can call programatically and includes detailed in-
       formation on data types and errors.

       NOTE:
          Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sam-
          ple  code  for  various programming languages and platforms, such as
          Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way
          to  create  programmatic access to Amazon Web Services SSO and other
          Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the  Amazon
          Web  Services  SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
