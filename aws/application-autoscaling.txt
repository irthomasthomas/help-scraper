          API Summary

       The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of ac-
       tions:

       o Register and manage scalable targets - Register Amazon  Web  Services
         or  custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application
         Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and
         retrieve information on existing scalable targets.

       o Configure  and  manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to
         dynamically scale your resources in response  to  CloudWatch  alarms,
         schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your re-
         cent scaling activity history.

       o Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume au-
         tomatic  scaling by calling the RegisterScalableTarget API action for
         any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and re-
         sume  (individually  or in combination) scale-out activities that are
         triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered
         by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.
