OPTIONS
       --recommender-id (string)
          The  unique identifier for the recommender model configuration. This
          identifier is displayed as the Recommender ID on the Amazon Pinpoint
          console.

       --update-recommender-configuration (structure)
          Specifies  Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings for retrieving and
          processing recommendation data from a recommender model.

          Attributes -> (map)
              A map of key-value pairs that defines 1-10  custom  endpoint  or
              user  attributes, depending on the value for the Recommendation-
              ProviderIdType property. Each of  these  attributes  temporarily
              stores  a recommended item that's retrieved from the recommender
              model and sent to an AWS Lambda function for additional process-
              ing.  Each attribute can be used as a message variable in a mes-
              sage template.

              In the map, the key is the name of a custom  attribute  and  the
              value  is  a custom display name for that attribute. The display
              name appears in the Attribute finder of the template  editor  on
              the Amazon Pinpoint console. The following restrictions apply to
              these names:

              o An attribute name must start with a letter or  number  and  it
                can  contain  up  to 50 characters. The characters can be let-
                ters, numbers, underscores  (_),  or  hyphens  (-).  Attribute
                names are case sensitive and must be unique.

              o An  attribute  display name must start with a letter or number
                and it can contain up to 25 characters. The characters can  be
                letters, numbers, spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

              This  object  is  required  if  the configuration invokes an AWS
              Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to process recom-
              mendation data. Otherwise, don't include this object in your re-
              quest.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Description -> (string)
              A custom description of the configuration  for  the  recommender
              model.  The  description  can  contain up to 128 characters. The
              characters can be letters, numbers,  spaces,  or  the  following
              symbols: _ ; () , .

          Name -> (string)
              A  custom  name  of the configuration for the recommender model.
              The name must start with a letter or number and it  can  contain
              up  to  128  characters. The characters can be letters, numbers,
              spaces, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).

          RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID to associate with unique user IDs
              in  the  recommender  model. This value enables the model to use
              attribute and event data thats specific to a particular endpoint
              or user in an Amazon Pinpoint application. Valid values are:

              o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Associate each user in the model with a
                particular endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is correlated
                based  on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. This is the default
                value.

              o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Associate each user in  the  model  with  a
                particular  user  and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is
                correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If you  spec-
                ify  this value, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has
                to specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID.  Other-
                wise, messages wont be sent to the user's endpoint.

          RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that authorizes  Amazon  Pinpoint  to  re-
              trieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender model to re-
              trieve recommendation data from. This value must match  the  ARN
              of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

          RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
              The  name  or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda func-
              tion to invoke for additional processing of recommendation  data
              that's retrieved from the recommender model.

          RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
              A  custom  display name for the standard endpoint or user attri-
              bute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily  stores  recommended
              items  for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the
              RecommendationProviderIdType property. This value is required if
              the  configuration doesn't invoke an AWS Lambda function (Recom-
              mendationTransformerUri) to  perform  additional  processing  of
              recommendation data.

              This name appears in the Attribute finder of the template editor
              on the Amazon Pinpoint console. The name can contain  up  to  25
              characters.  The characters can be letters, numbers, spaces, un-
              derscores (_), or hyphens (-). These restrictions don't apply to
              attribute values.

          RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
              The  number  of recommended items to retrieve from the model for
              each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the  Recommen-
              dationProviderIdType  property.  This number determines how many
              recommended items are available for use  in  message  variables.
              The  minimum  value  is  1.  The maximum value is 5. The default
              value is 5.

              To use multiple recommended items  and  custom  attributes  with
              message  variables, you have to use an AWS Lambda function (Rec-
              ommendationTransformerUri) to perform additional  processing  of
              recommendation data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Attributes": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "Description": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "RecommendationProviderIdType": "string",

            "RecommendationsDisplayName": "string",
            "RecommendationsPerMessage": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       RecommenderConfigurationResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about  Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings
          for retrieving and processing data from a recommender model.

          Attributes -> (map)
              A map that defines 1-10 custom endpoint or user attributes,  de-
              pending  on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType prop-
              erty. Each of these attributes temporarily stores a  recommended
              item  that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent to an
              AWS Lambda function for additional  processing.  Each  attribute
              can be used as a message variable in a message template.

              This  value  is  null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS
              Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform  addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              was created for the recommender model.

          Description -> (string)
              The custom description of the configuration for the  recommender
              model.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              for the recommender model was last modified.

          Name -> (string)
              The custom name of the configuration for the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID  that's  associated  with  unique
              user  IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the model
              to use attribute and event data thats specific to  a  particular
              endpoint  or  user  in  an Amazon Pinpoint application. Possible
              values are:

              o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Each user in the  model  is  associated
                with  a  particular  endpoint  in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is
                correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint.  This  is
                the default value.

              o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a
                particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The  data  is
                correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value
                is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to
                specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise,
                messages wont be sent to the user's endpoint.

          RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Identity  and  Access
              Management  (IAM)  role  that  authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to re-
              trieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  recommender  model  that
              Amazon  Pinpoint  retrieves  the  recommendation data from. This
              value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

          RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
              The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Lambda  func-
              tion that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to perform additional process-
              ing of recommendation data that it  retrieves  from  the  recom-
              mender model.

          RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
              The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attri-
              bute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily  stores  recommended
              items  for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the
              RecommendationProviderIdType property. This name appears in  the
              Attribute  finder  of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint
              console.

              This value is null if the configuration doesn't  invoke  an  AWS
              Lambda  function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

          RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
              The number of recommended items  that  are  retrieved  from  the
              model  for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the
              RecommendationProviderIdType property.  This  number  determines
              how  many  recommended  items  are  available for use in message
              variables.
