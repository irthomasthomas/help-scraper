NAME
       get-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the settings and attributes of a specific
       endpoint for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-endpoint
          --application-id <value>
          --endpoint-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       EndpointResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the channel type and other  settings  for
          an endpoint.

          Address -> (string)
              The  destination address for messages or push notifications that
              you send to the endpoint. The address varies by channel. For ex-
              ample,  the address for a push-notification channel is typically
              the token provided by a push notification service,  such  as  an
              Apple  Push  Notification service (APNs) device token or a Fire-
              base Cloud Messaging (FCM) registration token. The  address  for
              the  SMS  channel  is  a  phone  number in E.164 format, such as
              +12065550100. The address for the email channel is an email  ad-
              dress.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with
              the endpoint.

          Attributes -> (map)
              One or more custom attributes that describe the endpoint by  as-
              sociating a name with an array of values. For example, the value
              of a custom attribute named Interests might be: ["Science", "Mu-
              sic", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as filter criteria
              when you create segments.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

              tions to the endpoint.

          CohortId -> (string)
              A  number from 0-99 that represents the cohort that the endpoint
              is assigned to. Endpoints are grouped into cohorts randomly, and
              each  cohort  contains  approximately 1 percent of the endpoints
              for an application. Amazon Pinpoint assigns cohorts to the hold-
              out or treatment allocations for campaigns.

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The  date  and  time,  in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint was
              created.

          Demographic -> (structure)
              The demographic information for the endpoint, such as  the  time
              zone and platform.

              AppVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the app that's associated with the endpoint.

              Locale -> (string)
                 The  locale of the endpoint, in the following format: the ISO
                 639-1 alpha-2 code, followed by an underscore  (_),  followed
                 by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

              Make -> (string)
                 The  manufacturer  of  the  endpoint device, such as apple or
                 samsung.

              Model -> (string)
                 The model name or number of  the  endpoint  device,  such  as
                 iPhone or SM-G900F.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The model version of the endpoint device.

              Platform -> (string)

                 name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

          EffectiveDate -> (string)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format,  when  the  endpoint  was
              last updated.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether messages or push notifications are sent to the
              endpoint. Possible values are: ACTIVE, messages are sent to  the
              endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent sent to the endpoint.

              Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value to ACTIVE when you
              create an endpoint or update an existing endpoint.  Amazon  Pin-
              point  automatically  sets  this value to INACTIVE if you update
              another endpoint that has the same address specified by the  Ad-
              dress property.

          Id -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier  that  you assigned to the endpoint. The
              identifier should be a globally unique identifier (GUID) to  en-
              sure  that  it  doesn't conflict with other endpoint identifiers
              that are associated with the application.

                 country or region where the endpoint is located. For example,
                 US for the United States.

              Latitude -> (double)
                 The latitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded  to
                 one decimal place.

              Longitude -> (double)
                 The longitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded to
                 one decimal place.

              PostalCode -> (string)
                 The postal or ZIP code for the area where the endpoint is lo-
                 cated.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the region where the endpoint is located. For lo-
                 cations in the United States, this value is  the  name  of  a
                 state.

          Metrics -> (map)
              One  or more custom metrics that your app reports to Amazon Pin-
              point for the endpoint.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (double)

          OptOut -> (string)
              Specifies whether the user who's associated  with  the  endpoint
              has  opted out of receiving messages and push notifications from
              you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user  has  opted  out  and
              doesn't want to receive any messages or push notifications; and,
              NONE, the user hasn't opted out and wants to  receive  all  mes-
              sages and push notifications.

          RequestId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the most recent request to update the
              endpoint.

          User -> (structure)
              One or more custom user attributes that your app reports to Ama-
              zon Pinpoint for the user who's associated with the endpoint.

              UserAttributes -> (map)
                 One or more custom attributes that describe the user by asso-
                 ciating a name with an array  of  values.  For  example,  the
                 value  of  an attribute named Interests might be: ["Science",
                 "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these  attributes  as  filter
                 criteria  when  you create segments. Attribute names are case
                 sensitive.

                 An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An  attri-
                 bute  value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define
                 the name of a custom attribute,  avoid  using  the  following
                 characters:  number  sign  (#), colon (:), question mark (?),
                 backslash (), and slash  (/).  The  Amazon  Pinpoint  console
                 can't  display attribute names that contain these characters.
                 This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

              UserId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the user.
