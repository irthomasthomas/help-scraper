OPTIONS
       --recommender-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.  This
          identifier is displayed as the Recommender ID on the Amazon Pinpoint
          console.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RecommenderConfigurationResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about  Amazon Pinpoint configuration settings
          for retrieving and processing data from a recommender model.

          Attributes -> (map)
              A map that defines 1-10 custom endpoint or user attributes,  de-
              pending  on the value for the RecommendationProviderIdType prop-
              erty. Each of these attributes temporarily stores a  recommended
              item  that's retrieved from the recommender model and sent to an
              AWS Lambda function for additional  processing.  Each  attribute
              can be used as a message variable in a message template.

              This  value  is  null if the configuration doesn't invoke an AWS
              Lambda function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform  addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              was created for the recommender model.

          Description -> (string)
              The custom description of the configuration for the  recommender
              model.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the recommender model configuration.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The  date,  in  extended ISO 8601 format, when the configuration
              for the recommender model was last modified.

          Name -> (string)
              The custom name of the configuration for the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderIdType -> (string)
              The type of Amazon Pinpoint ID  that's  associated  with  unique
              user  IDs in the recommender model. This value enables the model
              to use attribute and event data thats specific to  a  particular
              endpoint  or  user  in  an Amazon Pinpoint application. Possible
              values are:

              o PINPOINT_ENDPOINT_ID - Each user in the  model  is  associated
                with  a  particular  endpoint  in Amazon Pinpoint. The data is
                correlated based on endpoint IDs in Amazon Pinpoint.  This  is
                the default value.

              o PINPOINT_USER_ID - Each user in the model is associated with a
                particular user and endpoint in Amazon Pinpoint. The  data  is
                correlated based on user IDs in Amazon Pinpoint. If this value
                is specified, an endpoint definition in Amazon Pinpoint has to
                specify both a user ID (UserId) and an endpoint ID. Otherwise,
                messages wont be sent to the user's endpoint.

          RecommendationProviderRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Identity  and  Access
              Management  (IAM)  role  that  authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to re-
              trieve recommendation data from the recommender model.

          RecommendationProviderUri -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  recommender  model  that
              Amazon  Pinpoint  retrieves  the  recommendation data from. This
              value is the ARN of an Amazon Personalize campaign.

          RecommendationTransformerUri -> (string)
              The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS  Lambda  func-
              tion that Amazon Pinpoint invokes to perform additional process-
              ing of recommendation data that it  retrieves  from  the  recom-
              mender model.

          RecommendationsDisplayName -> (string)
              The custom display name for the standard endpoint or user attri-
              bute (RecommendationItems) that temporarily  stores  recommended
              items  for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the
              RecommendationProviderIdType property. This name appears in  the
              Attribute  finder  of the template editor on the Amazon Pinpoint
              console.

              This value is null if the configuration doesn't  invoke  an  AWS
              Lambda  function (RecommendationTransformerUri) to perform addi-
              tional processing of recommendation data.

          RecommendationsPerMessage -> (integer)
              The number of recommended items  that  are  retrieved  from  the
              model  for each endpoint or user, depending on the value for the
              RecommendationProviderIdType property.  This  number  determines
              how  many  recommended  items  are  available for use in message
              variables.
