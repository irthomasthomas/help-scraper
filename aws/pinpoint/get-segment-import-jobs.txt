OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --segment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the segment.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       ImportJobsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings of all the import
          jobs that are associated with an application or segment.  An  import
          job  is  a  job  that  imports endpoint definitions from one or more
          files.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each import job that's associated
              with  the application (Import Jobs resource) or segment (Segment
              Import Jobs resource).

              (structure)
                 Provides information about the status and settings of  a  job
                 that imports endpoint definitions from one or more files. The
                 files can be stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Ama-
                 zon  S3) bucket or uploaded directly from a computer by using
                 the Amazon Pinpoint console.

                 ApplicationId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the application that's  associ-
                     ated with the import job.

                 CompletedPieces -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  pieces  that were processed successfully
                     (completed) by the import job, as of the time of the  re-
                     quest.

                 CompletionDate -> (string)
                     The  date,  in  ISO  8601 format, when the import job was
                     completed.

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The date, in ISO 8601 format, when  the  import  job  was
                     created.

                 Definition -> (structure)
                     The resource settings that apply to the import job.

                     DefineSegment -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether  the  import  job creates a segment
                        that contains the endpoints, when the endpoint defini-
                        tions are imported.

                     ExternalId -> (string)
                        (Deprecated)  Your  AWS account ID, which you assigned
                        to an external ID key in an IAM trust  policy.  Amazon
                        Pinpoint  previously  used this value to assume an IAM
                        role when importing endpoint definitions, but  we  re-
                        moved  this requirement. We don't recommend use of ex-
                        ternal IDs for IAM roles that are  assumed  by  Amazon
                        Pinpoint.

                     Format -> (string)
                        The format of the files that contain the endpoint def-
                        initions  to  import.  Valid  values  are:  CSV,   for
                        comma-separated  values  format;  and,  JSON, for new-
                        line-delimited JSON format.

                        If the files are stored in an Amazon S3  location  and
                        that location contains multiple files that use differ-
                        ent formats, Amazon Pinpoint imports  data  only  from
                        the files that use the specified format.

                     RegisterEndpoints -> (boolean)
                        Specifies  whether  the  import job registers the end-
                        points with Amazon Pinpoint, when the endpoint defini-
                        tions are imported.

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and
                        Access Management (IAM) role  that  authorizes  Amazon
                        Pinpoint  to  access  the Amazon S3 location to import
                        endpoint definitions from.

                     S3Url -> (string)
                        The URL of the Amazon Simple Storage  Service  (Amazon
                        S3)  bucket  that contains the endpoint definitions to
                        import. This location can be  a  folder  or  a  single
                        file. If the location is a folder, Amazon Pinpoint im-
                        ports endpoint definitions from the files in this  lo-
                        cation,  including any subfolders that the folder con-
                        tains.

                        The  URL  should   be   in   the   following   format:
                        s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name.  The  location
                        can end with the key for an  individual  object  or  a
                        prefix that qualifies multiple objects.

                     SegmentId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the segment that the import job up-
                        dates or adds endpoint definitions to, if  the  import
                        job updates an existing segment.

                     SegmentName -> (string)
                        The  custom name for the segment that's created by the
                        import job, if the value of the DefineSegment property
                        is true.

                 FailedPieces -> (integer)
                     The  number of pieces that weren't processed successfully
                     (failed) by the import job, as of the  time  of  the  re-
                     quest.

                 Failures -> (list)
                     An  array  of  entries, one for each of the first 100 en-
                     tries that weren't processed successfully (failed) by the
                     import job, if any.

                     (string)

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the import job.

                 JobStatus -> (string)
                     The status of the import job. The job status is FAILED if
                     Amazon Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces
                     in the job.

                 TotalFailures -> (integer)
                     The  total  number  of  endpoint definitions that weren't
                     processed successfully (failed) by the import job,  typi-
                     cally because an error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

                 TotalPieces -> (integer)
                     The total number of pieces that must be processed to com-
                     plete the import job. Each piece consists of an  approxi-
                     mately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are
                     part of the import job.

                 TotalProcessed -> (integer)
                     The total number of endpoint definitions that  were  pro-
                     cessed by the import job.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The job type. This value is IMPORT for import jobs.

          NextToken -> (string)
              The  string  to use in a subsequent request to get the next page
              of results in a paginated response. This value is null if  there
              are no additional pages.
