OPTIONS
       --create-new-version | --no-create-new-version (boolean)
          Specifies whether to save the updates as a new version of  the  mes-
          sage  template.  Valid  values  are: true, save the updates as a new
          version; and, false, save the updates to (overwrite) the latest  ex-
          isting version of the template.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint
          saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the
          template.  If  you specify a value of true for this parameter, don't
          specify a value for the version parameter. Otherwise, an error  will
          occur.

              plate. The corresponding value defines  the  default  value  for
              that  variable.  When  you  create a message that's based on the

       --template-name (string)
          The name of the message template. A template name must start with an
          alphanumeric  character and can contain a maximum of 128 characters.
          The characters can be alphanumeric characters, underscores  (_),  or
          hyphens (-). Template names are case sensitive.

       --template-version (string)
          The unique identifier for the version of the message template to up-
          date, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers
          and  other  information  for all the versions of a template, use the
          Template Versionsresource.

          If specified, this value must match the identifier for  an  existing
          template  version.  If specified for an update operation, this value
          must match the identifier for the latest  existing  version  of  the
          template.  This  restriction helps ensure that race conditions don't
          occur.

          If you don't specify a value for  this  parameter,  Amazon  Pinpoint
          does the following:

          o For  a  get operation, retrieves information about the active ver-
            sion of the template.

          o For an update operation, saves the  updates  to  (overwrites)  the
            latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version
            parameter isn't used or is set to false.

          o For a delete operation, deletes the template, including  all  ver-
            sions of the template.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
