OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

                                 HTTPS protocol.

                            EndpointTypes -> (list)

                               treatment to. Each valid value maps to  a  type
                               of  channel that you can associate with an end-
                               point by using the ChannelType property  of  an

                                          ment.

                                      Values -> (list)

                                          from a segment. These  criteria  de-
                                          rive  from  custom  metrics that you
                                          define for endpoints.

                                   endpoint event (Eventsresource) occurs.

                            Frequency -> (string)
                               Specifies how often the  campaign  is  sent  or
                               whether  the  campaign is sent in response to a

                               The  default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet
                               time is a specific time range when  a  campaign
                               doesn't  send messages to endpoints, if all the
                               following conditions are met:

                               o The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property  of
                                 the endpoint is set to a valid value.

                                 by  the QuietTime.Start property for the cam-
                                 paign.

                               o The current time in the endpoint's time  zone

                                 campaign.

                               If  any  of the preceding conditions isn't met,
                               the endpoint will  receive  messages  from  the
                               campaign, even if quiet time is enabled.

                               End -> (string)
                                   The  specific  time  when  quiet time ends.
                                   This value has to use 24-hour notation  and
                                   be  in  HH:MM  format, where HH is the hour
                                   (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM
                                   is  the  minutes. For example, use 02:30 to

                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:
                                      GREATER_THAN,                 LESS_THAN,
                                      GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                   Value -> (double)
                                      The value to compare.

                        FilterType -> (string)
                            The type of event that causes the campaign  to  be
                            sent. Valid values are: SYSTEM, sends the campaign

                     QuietTime -> (structure)
                        The default quiet time for the campaign. Quiet time is
                        a  specific  time  range  when a campaign doesn't send
                        messages to endpoints, if all the following conditions
                        are met:

                        o The  EndpointDemographic.Timezone  property  of  the
                          endpoint is set to a valid value.

                        o The current time in  the  endpoint's  time  zone  is
                          later  than  or  equal  to the time specified by the
                          QuietTime.Start property for the campaign.

                        o The current time in the endpoint's time zone is ear-
                          lier than or equal to the time specified by the Qui-
                          etTime.End property for the campaign.

                        If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the end-
                        point will receive messages from the campaign, even if
                        quiet time is enabled.

                        End -> (string)
                            The specific time when quiet time ends. This value
                            has  to  use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM for-
                            mat, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if
                            applicable)  and  MM  is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                        Start -> (string)
                            The  specific  time  when  quiet time begins. This
                            value has to use 24-hour notation and be in  HH:MM
                            format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero,
                            if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The scheduled time when the campaign began or will be-

                        paign immediately; or, a specific  time  in  ISO  8601
                        format.

                     Timezone -> (string)
                        The  starting UTC offset for the campaign schedule, if
                        the value of the IsLocalTime property is  true.  Valid
                        values  are:  UTC,  UTC+01, UTC+02, UTC+03, UTC+03:30,
                        UTC+04,  UTC+04:30,  UTC+05,   UTC+05:30,   UTC+05:45,

                        status of a treatment that belongs to an A/B test cam-
                        paign.

                        If a campaign uses A/B testing,  the  campaign  has  a
                        status  of  COMPLETED  only if all campaign treatments
                        have a status of COMPLETED. If you delete the  segment
                        that's  associated with a campaign, the campaign fails

                     the  tags that are associated with the campaign. Each tag
                     consists of a required tag  key  and  an  associated  tag
                     value.

                            message. If specified, this value must  match  the
                            name of an existing message template.

                        Version -> (string)

                            existing template version. To retrieve a  list  of
                            versions  and  version identifiers for a template,
                            use the Template Versionsresource.

                            If you don't specify a value  for  this  property,
