OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ExportJobResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings of a job that ex-
          ports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can be added directly
          to  an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket by using the
          Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded directly to a  computer  by  using
          the Amazon Pinpoint console.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with
              the export job.

          CompletedPieces -> (integer)
              The number of pieces  that  were  processed  successfully  (com-
              pleted) by the export job, as of the time of the request.

          CompletionDate -> (string)
              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was completed.

          CreationDate -> (string)

              The resource settings that apply to the export job.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
                 Management (IAM) role that authorized Amazon Pinpoint to  ac-
                 cess  the  Amazon  S3 location where the endpoint definitions
                 were exported to.

              S3UrlPrefix -> (string)
                 The URL of the location in an Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
                 (Amazon  S3)  bucket  where the endpoint definitions were ex-
                 ported to. This location is typically a folder that  contains
                 multiple  files.  The  URL should be in the following format:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/.

              SegmentId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the segment that the endpoint  definitions
                 were  exported from. If this value isn't present, Amazon Pin-
                 point exported definitions for all the endpoints that are as-
                 sociated with the application.

              SegmentVersion -> (integer)

          JobStatus -> (string)

              Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

          TotalFailures -> (integer)
              The total number of endpoint definitions that weren't  processed
              successfully  (failed)  by  the export job, typically because an
              error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

          TotalPieces -> (integer)
              The total number of pieces that must be  processed  to  complete
