OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --segment-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the segment.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       ExportJobsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  information  about all the export jobs that are associated

                 Provides  information  about the status and settings of a job
                 that exports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can  be
                 added  directly  to  an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon

                 CompletionDate -> (string)
                     The date, in ISO 8601 format, when  the  export  job  was

                        Pinpoint to access the Amazon S3  location  where  the

                        folder that contains multiple files. The URL should be
                        in           the           following           format:

                     plete the export job. Each piece consists of an  approxi-
                     mately equal portion of the endpoint definitions that are
                     part of the export job.
