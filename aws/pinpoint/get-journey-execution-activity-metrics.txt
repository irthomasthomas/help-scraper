OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --journey-activity-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey activity.

       --journey-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey.

       --next-token (string)
          The string that specifies which page of results to return in a pagi-
          nated response. This parameter is  not  supported  for  application,
          campaign, and journey metrics.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       JourneyExecutionActivityMetricsResponse -> (structure)
          Provides  the results of a query that retrieved the data for a stan-
          dard execution metric that applies to a journey activity,  and  pro-
          vides information about that query.

          ActivityType -> (string)
              The type of activity that the metric applies to. Possible values
              are:

              o CONDITIONAL_SPLIT  For a yes/no split activity,  which  is  an
                activity  that  sends  participants down one of two paths in a
                journey.

              o HOLDOUT  For a holdout activity, which  is  an  activity  that
                stops a journey for a specified percentage of participants.

              o MESSAGE   For  an  email  activity,  which is an activity that
                sends an email message to participants.

              o MULTI_CONDITIONAL_SPLIT  For a  multivariate  split  activity,
                which  is  an  activity that sends participants down one of as
                many as five paths in a journey.

              o RANDOM_SPLIT  For a random split activity, which is an  activ-
                ity  that sends specified percentages of participants down one
                of as many as five paths in a journey.

              o WAIT  For a wait activity, which is an activity that waits for
                a certain amount of time or until a specific date and time be-
                fore moving participants to the next activity in a journey.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that  the  metric  ap-
              plies to.

          JourneyActivityId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier for the activity that the metric applies
              to.

          JourneyId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the journey that  the  metric  applies
              to.

          LastEvaluatedTime -> (string)
              The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when Amazon Pinpoint last
              evaluated the execution status of the activity and  updated  the
              data for the metric.

          Metrics -> (map)
              A  JSON  object  that contains the results of the query. The re-
              sults vary depending on the type of activity (ActivityType). For
              information about the structure and contents of the results, see
              the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide .

              key -> (string)
