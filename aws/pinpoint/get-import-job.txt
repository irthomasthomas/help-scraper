OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ImportJobResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings of a job that im-
          ports  endpoint definitions from one or more files. The files can be
          stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket or up-
          loaded  directly  from  a computer by using the Amazon Pinpoint con-
          sole.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the application that's associated with
              the import job.

          CompletedPieces -> (integer)
              The  number  of  pieces  that  were processed successfully (com-
              pleted) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

          CompletionDate -> (string)
              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was completed.

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the import job was created.

          Definition -> (structure)
              The resource settings that apply to the import job.

              DefineSegment -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the import job creates a segment that  con-
                 tains  the  endpoints,  when the endpoint definitions are im-
                 ported.

              ExternalId -> (string)
                 (Deprecated) Your AWS account ID, which you  assigned  to  an
                 external  ID key in an IAM trust policy. Amazon Pinpoint pre-
                 viously used this value to assume an IAM role when  importing
                 endpoint  definitions,  but  we  removed this requirement. We
                 don't recommend use of external IDs for IAM  roles  that  are
                 assumed by Amazon Pinpoint.

              Format -> (string)
                 The format of the files that contain the endpoint definitions
                 to import. Valid values are: CSV, for comma-separated  values
                 format; and, JSON, for newline-delimited JSON format.

                 If the files are stored in an Amazon S3 location and that lo-
                 cation contains multiple files that  use  different  formats,
                 Amazon Pinpoint imports data only from the files that use the
                 specified format.

              RegisterEndpoints -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the import job registers the endpoints with
                 Amazon Pinpoint, when the endpoint definitions are imported.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
                 Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to  ac-
                 cess  the  Amazon  S3 location to import endpoint definitions
                 from.

              S3Url -> (string)
                 The URL of the Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  (Amazon  S3)
                 bucket that contains the endpoint definitions to import. This
                 location can be a folder or a single file. If the location is
                 a  folder,  Amazon Pinpoint imports endpoint definitions from
                 the files in this location, including any subfolders that the
                 folder contains.

                 The    URL    should    be    in    the   following   format:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/file-name. The location can  end
                 with the key for an individual object or a prefix that quali-
                 fies multiple objects.

              SegmentId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the segment that the import job updates or
                 adds  endpoint  definitions  to, if the import job updates an
                 existing segment.

              SegmentName -> (string)
                 The custom name for the segment that's created by the  import
                 job, if the value of the DefineSegment property is true.

          FailedPieces -> (integer)
              The   number  of  pieces  that  weren't  processed  successfully
              (failed) by the import job, as of the time of the request.

          Failures -> (list)
              An array of entries, one for each of the first 100 entries  that
              weren't  processed  successfully  (failed) by the import job, if
              any.

              (string)

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the import job.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              The status of the import job. The job status is FAILED if Amazon
              Pinpoint wasn't able to process one or more pieces in the job.

          TotalFailures -> (integer)
              The  total number of endpoint definitions that weren't processed
              successfully (failed) by the import job,  typically  because  an
              error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

          TotalPieces -> (integer)
              The  total  number  of pieces that must be processed to complete
              the import job. Each piece consists of  an  approximately  equal
              portion  of the endpoint definitions that are part of the import
              job.

          TotalProcessed -> (integer)
              The total number of endpoint definitions that were processed  by
              the import job.

          Type -> (string)
              The job type. This value is IMPORT for import jobs.
