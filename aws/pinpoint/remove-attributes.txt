REMOVE-ATTRIBUTES()                                        REMOVE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       remove-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes one or more custom attributes, of the same attribute type, from
       the application. Existing endpoints still have the attributes but  Ama-
       zon  Pinpoint  will  stop capturing new or changed values for these at-
       tributes.

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --attribute-type (string)
          The type of attribute or attributes to remove. Valid values are:

          o endpoint-custom-attributes  - Custom attributes that describe end-
            points, such as the date when an associated user opted in  or  out
            of  receiving  communications  from you through a specific type of
            channel.

          o endpoint-metric-attributes - Custom metrics that your app  reports
            to  Amazon  Pinpoint for endpoints, such as the number of app ses-
            sions or the number of items left in a cart.

          o endpoint-user-attributes - Custom attributes that describe  users,
            such as first name, last name, and age.

       --update-attributes-request (structure)
          Specifies  one  or  more attributes to remove from all the endpoints
          that are associated with an application.

          Blacklist -> (list)
              An array of the attributes to remove from all the endpoints that
              are  associated  with the application. The array can specify the
              complete, exact name of each attribute to remove or it can spec-
              ify  a  glob  pattern that an attribute name must match in order
              for the attribute to be removed.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Blacklist=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Blacklist": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
