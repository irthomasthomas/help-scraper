GET-GCM-CHANNEL()                                            GET-GCM-CHANNEL()



NAME
       get-gcm-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about the status and settings of the GCM channel
       for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-gcm-channel
          --application-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about the status and settings of the GCM  chan-
       nel for an application

       The  following  get-gcm-channel example retrieves information about the
       status and settings of the GCM channel for an application.

          aws pinpoint get-gcm-channel \
              --application-id 6e0b7591a90841d2b5d93fa11143e5a7 \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "GCMChannelResponse": {
                  "ApplicationId": "6e0b7591a90841d2b5d93fa11143e5a7",
                  "CreationDate": "2019-10-08T18:28:23.182Z",
                  "Enabled": true,
                  "HasCredential": true,
                  "Id": "gcm",
                  "IsArchived": false,
                  "LastModifiedDate": "2019-10-08T18:28:23.182Z",
                  "Platform": "GCM",
                  "Version": 1
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       GCMChannelResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings of the GCM  chan-
          nel  for  an application. The GCM channel enables Amazon Pinpoint to
          send push notifications through the Firebase Cloud Messaging  (FCM),
          formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), service.

          ApplicationId -> (string)
              The  unique  identifier for the application that the GCM channel
              applies to.

          CreationDate -> (string)
              The date and time when the GCM channel was enabled.

          Credential -> (string)
              The Web API Key, also referred to as an API_KEY or server key  ,
              that  you  received  from Google to communicate with Google ser-
              vices.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the GCM channel is enabled  for  the  applica-
              tion.

          HasCredential -> (boolean)
              (Not  used) This property is retained only for backward compati-
              bility.

          Id -> (string)
              (Deprecated) An identifier for the GCM channel. This property is
              retained only for backward compatibility.

          IsArchived -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the GCM channel is archived.

          LastModifiedBy -> (string)
              The user who last modified the GCM channel.

          LastModifiedDate -> (string)
              The date and time when the GCM channel was last modified.

          Platform -> (string)
              The  type of messaging or notification platform for the channel.
              For the GCM channel, this value is GCM.

          Version -> (integer)
              The current version of the GCM channel.
