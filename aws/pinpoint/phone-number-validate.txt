OPTIONS
       --number-validate-request (structure)
          Specifies a phone number to validate and retrieve information about.

          IsoCountryCode -> (string)
              The  two-character  code,  in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for the
              country or region where the phone number was  originally  regis-
              tered.

          PhoneNumber -> (string)
              The phone number to retrieve information about. The phone number
              that you provide should include a valid  numeric  country  code.
              Otherwise, the operation might result in an error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IsoCountryCode=string,PhoneNumber=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IsoCountryCode": "string",
            "PhoneNumber": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
