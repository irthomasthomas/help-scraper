OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --events-request (structure)
          Specifies a batch of events to process.

          BatchItem -> (map)
              The  batch  of  events to process. For each item in a batch, the
              endpoint ID acts as a key that has an EventsBatch object as  its
              value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)

                        point by associating a name with an array  of  values.
                        You  can  use these attributes as filter criteria when
                        you create segments.

                        Specifies whether to send messages or  push  notifica-
                        tions  to the endpoint. Valid values are: ACTIVE, mes-

                        sages arent sent to the endpoint.

                        Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically sets this value to AC-
                        TIVE when you create an endpoint or update an existing
                        endpoint.  Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically  sets  this
                        value to INACTIVE if you update another endpoint  that
                        has  the  same  address specified by the Address prop-

                            is located. For example, US for the United States.

                     Metrics -> (map)
                        One or more custom metrics that your  app  reports  to

                        endpoint has opted out of receiving messages and  push
                        notifications  from you. Possible values are: ALL, the
                        user has opted out and doesn't  want  to  receive  any
                        messages  or  push  notifications; and, NONE, the user
                        hasn't opted out and wants to receive all messages and
                        push notifications.

                        A  unique  identifier  that's  generated each time the
                        endpoint is updated.

                     User -> (structure)
                        One or more custom user attributes that your  app  re-
                        ports to Amazon Pinpoint for the user who's associated
                        with the endpoint.

                        UserAttributes -> (map)
                            One or more custom attributes  that  describe  the
                            user  by  associating a name with an array of val-
                            ues. For example, the value of an attribute  named
                            Interests    might    be:   ["Science",   "Music",
                            "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as  filter
                            criteria when you create segments. Attribute names
                            are case sensitive.

                            An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters.
                            An  attribute  value can contain up to 100 charac-
                            ters. When you define the name of a custom  attri-
                            bute, avoid using the following characters: number
                            sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?),  backslash
                            (),  and  slash  (/).  The Amazon Pinpoint console
                            can't display attribute names that  contain  these
                            characters.  This restriction doesn't apply to at-
                            tribute values.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          sociated with.

          Results -> (map)
              A map that contains a multipart response for each endpoint.  For
              each  item  in  this  object, the endpoint ID is the key and the
              item response is the value. If  no  item  response  exists,  the
              value  can  also  be  one of the following: 202, the request was
              processed successfully; or 400, the payload wasn't valid or  re-
              quired fields were missing.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Provides information about the results of a request to create
                 or update an endpoint that's associated with an event.

                 EndpointItemResponse -> (structure)
                     The response that was received after  the  endpoint  data
                     was accepted.

                     Message -> (string)
                        The  custom message that's returned in the response as
                        a result of processing the endpoint data.

                     StatusCode -> (integer)
                        The status code that's returned in the response  as  a
                        result of processing the endpoint data.

                 EventsItemResponse -> (map)
                     A  multipart  response  object  that contains a key and a
                     value for each event in the request. In each object,  the
                     event  ID  is  the key and an EventItemResponse object is
                     the value.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Provides the status code and message that result  from
                        processing an event.

                        Message -> (string)

                            as a result of processing the event.

                        StatusCode -> (integer)
                            The status code that's returned in the response as
                            a  result of processing the event. Possible values
                            are: 202, for events that were accepted; and, 400,
                            for events that weren't valid.
