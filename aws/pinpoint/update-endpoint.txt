UPDATE-ENDPOINT()                                            UPDATE-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       update-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new endpoint for an application or updates the settings and
       attributes of an existing endpoint for an application. You can also use
       this  operation  to define custom attributes for an endpoint. If an up-
       date includes one or more values for a custom  attribute,  Amazon  Pin-
       point replaces (overwrites) any existing values with the new values.

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The case insensitive unique identifier for the endpoint. The identi-
          fier can't contain $ , { or } .

       --endpoint-request (structure)
          Specifies the channel type and other settings for an endpoint.

          Address -> (string)
              The  destination address for messages or push notifications that
              you send to the endpoint. The address varies by channel.  For  a
              push-notification  channel,  use  the token provided by the push
              notification service, such as an Apple Push Notification service
              (APNs)  device  token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) regis-
              tration token. For the SMS channel, use a phone number in  E.164
              format,  such  as  +12065550100.  For  the email channel, use an
              email address.

          Attributes -> (map)
              One or more custom attributes that describe the endpoint by  as-
              sociating a name with an array of values. For example, the value
              of a custom attribute named Interests might be: ["Science", "Mu-
              sic", "Travel"]. You can use these attributes as filter criteria
              when you create segments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

              An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An  attribute
              value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define the name
              of a custom attribute, avoid  using  the  following  characters:
              number sign (#), colon (:), question mark (?), backslash (), and
              slash (/). The Amazon Pinpoint console can't  display  attribute
              names  that  contain  these characters. This restriction doesn't
              apply to attribute values.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

          ChannelType -> (string)
              The channel to use when sending messages or  push  notifications
              to the endpoint.

          Demographic -> (structure)
              The  demographic  information for the endpoint, such as the time
              zone and platform.

                 The version of the app that's associated with the endpoint.

              Locale -> (string)
                 The locale of the endpoint, in the following format: the  ISO
                 639-1  alpha-2  code, followed by an underscore (_), followed
                 by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

              Make -> (string)
                 The manufacturer of the endpoint device,  such  as  apple  or

              Model -> (string)
                 The  model  name  or  number  of the endpoint device, such as
                 iPhone or SM-G900F.

              ModelVersion -> (string)
                 The model version of the endpoint device.

              Platform -> (string)

              PlatformVersion -> (string)
                 The platform version of the endpoint device.

              Timezone -> (string)
                 The time zone of the endpoint, specified  as  a  tz  database
                 name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

          EffectiveDate -> (string)
              The  date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint is up-
              dated.

          EndpointStatus -> (string)
              Specifies whether to send messages or push notifications to  the
              endpoint.  Valid  values  are:  ACTIVE, messages are sent to the
              endpoint; and, INACTIVE, messages arent sent to the endpoint.

              Amazon Pinpoint automatically sets this value to ACTIVE when you
              create  an  endpoint or update an existing endpoint. Amazon Pin-
              point automatically sets this value to INACTIVE  if  you  update
              another  endpoint that has the same address specified by the Ad-
              dress property.

                 US for the United States.

              Latitude -> (double)
                 The latitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded  to
                 one decimal place.

              Longitude -> (double)
                 The longitude coordinate of the endpoint location, rounded to
                 one decimal place.

              PostalCode -> (string)
                 The postal or ZIP code for the area where the endpoint is lo-
                 cated.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the region where the endpoint is located. For lo-
                 cations in the United States, this value is  the  name  of  a
                 state.

          Metrics -> (map)

          OptOut -> (string)
              Specifies whether the user who's associated  with  the  endpoint
              has  opted out of receiving messages and push notifications from
              you. Possible values are:  ALL,  the  user  has  opted  out  and
              doesn't want to receive any messages or push notifications; and,
              NONE, the user hasn't opted out and wants to  receive  all  mes-
              sages and push notifications.

          RequestId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier for the most recent request to update the
              endpoint.

          User -> (structure)
              One or more custom attributes that describe the user who's asso-
              ciated with the endpoint.

              UserAttributes -> (map)
                 One or more custom attributes that describe the user by asso-
                 ciating a name with an array  of  values.  For  example,  the
                 value  of  an attribute named Interests might be: ["Science",
                 "Music", "Travel"]. You can use these  attributes  as  filter
                 criteria  when  you create segments. Attribute names are case
                 sensitive.

                 An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters. An  attri-
                 bute  value can contain up to 100 characters. When you define
                 the name of a custom attribute,  avoid  using  the  following
                 characters:  number  sign  (#), colon (:), question mark (?),
                 backslash (), and slash  (/).  The  Amazon  Pinpoint  console
                 can't  display attribute names that contain these characters.
                 This restriction doesn't apply to attribute values.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
