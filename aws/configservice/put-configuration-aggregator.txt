PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()                  PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()



NAME
       put-configuration-aggregator -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and  updates  the  configuration  aggregator with the selected
       source accounts and regions. The source account can be  individual  ac-
       count(s) or an organization.
          accountIds  that are passed will be replaced with existing accounts.
          If you want to add additional accounts into the aggregator, call De-
          scribeConfigurationAggregators to get the previous accounts and then
          append new ones.

       NOTE:
          Config should be enabled in source accounts and regions you want  to
          aggregate.

          If your source type is an organization, you must be signed in to the
          management account or a registered delegated administrator  and  all
          the  features must be enabled in your organization. If the caller is
          a management account, Config calls EnableAwsServiceAccess API to en-
          able  integration between Config and Organizations. If the caller is
          a registered delegated administrator, Config calls  ListDelegatedAd-
          ministrators  API  to verify whether the caller is a valid delegated
          administrator.

          To register a delegated administrator, see Register a Delegated  Ad-
          ministrator in the Config developer guide .

       NOTE:
          PutConfigurationAggregator is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests
          wont create a duplicate resource if one was already  created.  If  a
          following  request  has  different  tags  values, Config will ignore
          these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the  pre-
          vious. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are dif-
          ferent.

                 The source regions being aggregated.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountIds=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean,AwsRegions=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountIds": ["string", ...],
              "AllAwsRegions": true|false,
              "AwsRegions": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --organization-aggregation-source (structure)
          An OrganizationAggregationSource object.

          RoleArn -> (string)

              zation details associated with the aggregator account.

          AwsRegions -> (list)
              The source regions being aggregated.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,AwsRegions=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "AwsRegions": ["string", ...],
            "AllAwsRegions": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of tag object.

          (structure)
              The tags for the resource. The metadata that you apply to a  re-
              source  to  help you categorize and organize them. Each tag con-
              sists of a key and an optional value, both of which you  define.
              Tag  keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
