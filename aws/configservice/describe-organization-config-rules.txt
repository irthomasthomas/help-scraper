NAME
       describe-organization-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of organization Config rules.

       NOTE:
          When  you  specify the limit and the next token, you receive a pagi-
          nated response.

          Limit and next token are not applicable if you specify  organization
          Config  rule  names. It is only applicable, when you request all the
          organization Config rules.
              For accounts within an organzation

          If you deploy an organizational rule or conformance pack in an orga-
          nization  administrator  account, and then establish a delegated ad-
          ministrator and deploy an organizational rule or conformance pack in
          the  delegated  administrator  account, you won't be able to see the
          organizational rule or conformance pack in the organization adminis-
          trator  account  from the delegated administrator account or see the
          organizational rule or conformance pack in the delegated administra-
          tor account from organization administrator account. The DescribeOr-
          ganizationConfigRules and DescribeOrganizationConformancePacks  APIs
          can  only  see  and  interact with the organization-related resource
          that were deployed from within the account calling those APIs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-organization-config-rules is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: OrganizationConfigRules

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-names (list)
          The  names  of organization Config rules for which you want details.
          If you do not specify any names, Config returns details for all your
          organization Config rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     Config rule.

                 RuleIdentifier -> (string)
                     For organization config managed rules, a predefined iden-
                     tifier from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a
                     managed rule. To reference a managed rule, see Using Con-
                     fig managed rules .

                     The  maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations
                     for a rule. This is for an Config managed  rule  that  is
                     triggered at a periodic frequency.

                     NOTE:
                        By  default,  rules with a periodic trigger are evalu-
                        ated every 24 hours. To change the frequency,  specify
                        a valid value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency param-
                        eter.

                     cific tag values.

                 TagValueScope -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.

                 An OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata object.

                 Description -> (string)

                     tification types:

                     o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers an eval-
                       uation  when  Config delivers a configuration item as a

                     o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Triggers
                       an evaluation when Config delivers an oversized config-
                       uration item. Config  may  generate  this  notification
                       type  when  a resource changes and the notification ex-

                     cific tag values.

                 TagValueScope -> (string)
                     The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.

                 other custom rule metadata, such as resource  type,  resource
                 ID  of Amazon Web Services resource, and organization trigger
                 types that initiate Config to evaluate  Amazon  Web  Services
                 resources against a rule.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The  description  that  you provide for your organization

                       uration item. Config  may  generate  this  notification
                       type  when  a resource changes and the notification ex-
