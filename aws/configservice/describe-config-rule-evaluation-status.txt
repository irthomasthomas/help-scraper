DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULE-EVALUATION-STATUSDESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULE-EVALUATION-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-config-rule-evaluation-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  status  information for each of your Config managed rules. The
       status includes information such as the last time  Config  invoked  the
       rule,  the  last time Config failed to invoke the rule, and the related
       error for the last failure.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-config-rule-evaluation-status is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ConfigRulesEvaluationStatus

SYNOPSIS
            describe-config-rule-evaluation-status
          [--config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          The  name  of the Config managed rules for which you want status in-
          formation. If you do not specify any names,  Config  returns  status
          information for all Config managed rules that you use.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get status information for an AWS Config rule

       The following command returns the status information for an AWS  Config
       rule named MyConfigRule:

          aws configservice describe-config-rule-evaluation-status --config-rule-names MyConfigRule

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigRulesEvaluationStatus": [
                  {
                      "ConfigRuleArn": "arn:aws:config:us-east-1:123456789012:config-rule/config-rule-abcdef",
                      "FirstActivatedTime": 1450311703.844,
                      "ConfigRuleId": "config-rule-abcdef",
                      "LastSuccessfulInvocationTime": 1450314643.156,
                      "ConfigRuleName": "MyConfigRule"
                  }
              ]
          }
