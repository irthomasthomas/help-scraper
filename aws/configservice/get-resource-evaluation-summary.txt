GET-RESOURCE-EVALUATION-SUMMARY()            GET-RESOURCE-EVALUATION-SUMMARY()



NAME
       get-resource-evaluation-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  summary  of  resource evaluation for the specified resource
       evaluation ID from the proactive rules that were run. The results indi-
       cate which evaluation context was used to evaluate the rules, which re-
       source details were evaluated, the evaluation mode that  was  run,  and
       whether  the  resource  details  comply  with  the configuration of the
       proactive rules.

       NOTE:
          To see additional information about the evaluation result,  such  as
          which   rule   flagged   a   resource   as  NON_COMPLIANT,  use  the
          GetComplianceDetailsByResource API. For more  information,  see  the
          Examples section.

OPTIONS
       --resource-evaluation-id (string)
          The unique ResourceEvaluationId of Amazon Web Services resource exe-
          cution for which you want to retrieve the evaluation summary.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
