OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-name (string)
          Name of the conformance pack.

       --filters (structure)
          A ConformancePackEvaluationFilters object.

          ConfigRuleNames -> (list)
              Filters the results by Config rule names.

              (string)

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              Filters the results by compliance.

              The allowed values are COMPLIANT and  NON_COMPLIANT  .  INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA is not supported.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              Filters   the   results  by  the  resource  type  (for  example,
              "AWS::EC2::Instance" ).

          ResourceIds -> (list)
              Filters the results by resource IDs.

              NOTE:
                 This is valid only when you provide resource type.  If  there
                 is no resource type, you will see an error.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigRuleNames=string,string,ComplianceType=string,ResourceType=string,ResourceIds=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigRuleNames": ["string", ...],
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
            "ResourceType": "string",
            "ResourceIds": ["string", ...]
          }

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of evaluation results returned on each page. If
          you do no specify a number, Config uses the default. The default  is
          100.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
