NAME
       describe-configuration-recorders -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details for the specified configuration recorders. If the
       configuration recorder is not specified, this action  returns  the  de-
       tails for all configuration recorders associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          You  can specify only one configuration recorder for each Amazon Web
          Services Region for each account.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-names (list)
          A list of configuration recorder names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details about the configuration recorder

       The following command returns details about the  default  configuration
       recorder:

          aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigurationRecorders": [
                  {
                      "recordingGroup": {
                          "allSupported": true,
                          "resourceTypes": [],
                          "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
                      },
                      "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-ConfigRole-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
                      "name": "default"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationRecorders -> (list)
          A list that contains the descriptions of the specified configuration
          recorders.

          (structure)
              Records configuration changes to specified resource  types.  For
              more  information about the configuration recorder, see ` Manag-
              ing            the            Configuration             Recorder
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html`__
              in the Config Developer Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration recorder. Config  automatically
                 assigns the name of "default" when creating the configuration
                 recorder.

                 You cannot change the name of the configuration recorder  af-
                 ter it has been created. To change the configuration recorder
                 name, you must delete  it  and  create  a  new  configuration
                 recorder with a new name.

              roleARN -> (string)
                 Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role assumed by Config
                 and used by the configuration recorder.

                 NOTE:
                     While the API model does  not  require  this  field,  the
                     server  will  reject  a request without a defined roleARN
                     for the configuration recorder.

                 NOTE:
                        Pre-existing Config role

                     If you have used an Amazon Web Services service that uses
                     Config,  such  as  Security  Hub or Control Tower, and an
                     Config role has already been created, make sure that  the
                     IAM  role  that  you use when setting up Config keeps the
                     same minimum permissions as the  already  created  Config
                     role.  You must do this so that the other Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices service continues to run as expected.

                     For example, if Control Tower has an IAM role that allows
                     Config  to read Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                     objects, make sure that the same permissions are  granted
                     within  the IAM role you use when setting up Config. Oth-
                     erwise, it may interfere with how Control Tower operates.
                     For  more  information  about IAM roles for Config, see `
                     Identity    and    Access    Management    for     Config
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html`__
                     in the Config Developer Guide .

              recordingGroup -> (structure)
                 Specifies which resource types Config records for  configura-
                 tion changes.

                 NOTE:
                        High Number of Config Evaluations

                     You  may notice increased activity in your account during
                     your initial month recording with Config when compared to
                     subsequent   months.  During  the  initial  bootstrapping
                     process, Config runs evaluations on all the resources  in
                     your account that you have selected for Config to record.

                     If  you  are running ephemeral workloads, you may see in-
                     creased activity from Config as it records  configuration
                     changes  associated with creating and deleting these tem-
                     porary resources. An ephemeral workload  is  a  temporary
                     use  of  computing resources that are loaded and run when
                     needed. Examples include  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
                     (Amazon  EC2)  Spot  Instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and Auto
                     Scaling. If you want to avoid the increased activity from
                     running  ephemeral  workloads, you can run these types of
                     workloads in a separate account with Config turned off to
                     avoid  increased configuration recording and rule evalua-
                     tions.

                 allSupported -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Config  records  configuration  changes
                     for all supported regional resource types.

                     If  you set this field to true , when Config adds support
                     for a  new  type  of  regional  resource,  Config  starts
                     recording resources of that type automatically.

                     If you set this field to true , you cannot enumerate spe-
                     cific resource types to record in the resourceTypes field
                     of  RecordingGroup  ,  or to exclude in the resourceTypes
                     field of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                 includeGlobalResourceTypes -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Config  records  configuration  changes
                     for all supported global resources.

                     Before  you set this field to true , set the allSupported
                     field of RecordingGroup to true . Optionally, you can set
                     the   useOnly  field  of  RecordingStrategy  to  ALL_SUP-
                     PORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                     If you set this field to true , when Config adds  support
                     for a new type of global resource in the Region where you
                     set up the configuration recorder, Config starts  record-
                     ing resources of that type automatically.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  set  this  field to false but list global re-
                        source   types   in   the   resourceTypes   field   of
                        RecordingGroup  ,  Config will still record configura-
                        tion changes for those specified  resource  types  re-
                        gardless  of if you set the includeGlobalResourceTypes
                        field to false.

                        If you do not want to record configuration changes  to
                        global  resource  types, make sure to not list them in
                        the resourceTypes field in addition to setting the in-
                        cludeGlobalResourceTypes field to false.

                 resourceTypes -> (list)
                     A  comma-separated  list  that  specifies  which resource
                     types Config records.

                     Optionally,  you   can   set   the   useOnly   field   of
                     RecordingStrategy to INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                     To record all configuration changes, set the allSupported
                     field of RecordingGroup to true , and  either  omit  this
                     field  or don't specify any resource types in this field.
                     If you set the allSupported field to  false  and  specify
                     values for resourceTypes , when Config adds support for a
                     new type of resource, it will  not  record  resources  of
                     that  type  unless  you  manually  add  that type to your
                     recording group.

                     For a list of valid resourceTypes  values,  see  the  Re-
                     source Type Value column in Supported Amazon Web Services
                     resource Types in the Config developer guide .

                     NOTE:
                            Region Availability

                        Before specifying a resource type for Config to track,
                        check  Resource Coverage by Region Availability to see
                        if the resource type is supported in  the  Amazon  Web
                        Services Region where you set up Config. If a resource
                        type is supported by Config in at  least  one  Region,
                        you  can enable the recording of that resource type in
                        all Regions supported by Config, even if the specified
                        resource  type is not supported in the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Region where you set up Config.

                     (string)

                 exclusionByResourceTypes -> (structure)
                     An object that specifies  how  Config  excludes  resource
                     types from being recorded by the configuration recorder.

                     To  use  this  option,  you must set the useOnly field of
                     RecordingStrategy to EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                     resourceTypes -> (list)
                        A comma-separated list of resource  types  to  exclude
                        from recording by the configuration recorder.

                        (string)

                 recordingStrategy -> (structure)
                     An  object  that specifies the recording strategy for the
                     configuration recorder.

                     o If you set the useOnly field  of  RecordingStrategy  to
                       ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES  , Config records configu-
                       ration changes  for  all  supported  regional  resource
                       types.  You  also  must  set  the allSupported field of
                       RecordingGroup to true . When Config adds support for a
                       new  type  of  regional  resource, Config automatically
                       starts recording resources of that type.

                     o If you set the useOnly field  of  RecordingStrategy  to
                       INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES , Config records configura-
                       tion changes for only the resource types you specify in
                       the resourceTypes field of RecordingGroup .

                     o If  you  set  the useOnly field of RecordingStrategy to
                       EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES , Config records configura-
                       tion  changes  for  all supported resource types except
                       the resource types that you specify  as  exemptions  to
                       exclude  from being recorded in the resourceTypes field
                       of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                        The recordingStrategy field is optional when  you  set
                        the allSupported field of RecordingGroup to true .

                        The  recordingStrategy field is optional when you list
                        resource  types  in   the   resourceTypes   field   of
                        RecordingGroup .

                        The  recordingStrategy  field  is required if you list
                        resource types to exclude from recording  in  the  re-
                        sourceTypes field of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                        If  you  choose  EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES  for  the
                        recording strategy, the exclusionByResourceTypes field
                        will override other properties in the request.

                        For  example,  even  if you set includeGlobalResource-
                        Types to false, global resource types  will  still  be
                        automatically recorded in this option unless those re-
                        source types are specifically listed as exemptions  in
                        the resourceTypes field of exclusionByResourceTypes .

                        By   default,   if  you  choose  the  EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                        SOURCE_TYPES recording strategy, when Config adds sup-
                        port  for  a new resource type in the Region where you
                        set up the configuration  recorder,  including  global
                        resource  types,  Config starts recording resources of
                        that type automatically.

                     useOnly -> (string)
                        The recording strategy for the configuration recorder.

                        o If  you  set  this   option   to   ALL_SUPPORTED_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES  , Config records configuration changes
                          for all supported regional resource types. You  also
                          must set the allSupported field of RecordingGroup to
                          true . When Config adds support for a  new  type  of
                          regional   resource,   Config  automatically  starts
                          recording resources of that type. For a list of sup-
                          ported  resource types, see Supported Resource Types
                          in the Config developer guide .

                        o If  you  set   this   option   to   INCLUSION_BY_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES  , Config records configuration changes
                          for only the resource types that you specify in  the
                          resourceTypes field of RecordingGroup .

                        o If   you   set   this   option  to  EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES , Config records configuration  changes
                          for  all  supported  resource  types, except the re-
                          source types that you specify as exemptions  to  ex-
                          clude from being recorded in the resourceTypes field
                          of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                        NOTE:
                            The recordingStrategy field is optional  when  you
                            set  the  allSupported  field of RecordingGroup to
                            true .

                            The recordingStrategy field is optional  when  you
                            list  resource types in the resourceTypes field of
                            RecordingGroup .

                            The recordingStrategy field  is  required  if  you
                            list  resource  types to exclude from recording in
                            the         resourceTypes         field         of
                            ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                        NOTE:
                            If  you choose EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES for the
                            recording strategy,  the  exclusionByResourceTypes
                            field  will  override  other properties in the re-
                            quest.

                            For example,  even  if  you  set  includeGlobalRe-
                            sourceTypes  to  false, global resource types will
                            still be automatically recorded in this option un-
                            less  those resource types are specifically listed
                            as exemptions in the resourceTypes field of exclu-
                            sionByResourceTypes .

                            By  default,  if  you  choose the EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                            SOURCE_TYPES recording strategy, when Config  adds
                            support  for  a  new  resource  type in the Region
                            where you set up the configuration  recorder,  in-
                            cluding   global  resource  types,  Config  starts
                            recording resources of that type automatically.
