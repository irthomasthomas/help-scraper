NAME
       describe-configuration-recorders -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details for the configuration recorder you specify.

       If  a  configuration  recorder is not specified, this operation returns
       details for the customer managed configuration recorder configured  for
       the account, if applicable.

       NOTE:
          When  making  a  request to this operation, you can only specify one
          configuration recorder.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-names (list)
          A list of names of the configuration  recorders  that  you  want  to
          specify.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-principal (string)
          For  service-linked configuration recorders, you can use the service
          principal of the linked Amazon Web Services service to  specify  the
          configuration recorder.

       --arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the configuration recorder that
          you want to specify.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details about the configuration recorder

       The  following  command returns details about the default configuration
       recorder:

          aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigurationRecorders": [
                  {
                      "recordingGroup": {
                          "allSupported": true,
                          "resourceTypes": [],
                          "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
                      },
                      "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-ConfigRole-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
                      "name": "default"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationRecorders -> (list)
          A list that contains the descriptions of the specified configuration
          recorders.

          (structure)
              Records configuration changes to the resource types in scope.

              For  more  information  about  the configuration recorder, see `
              Working       with       the       Configuration        Recorder
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html`__
              in the Config Developer Guide .

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified configuration
                 recorder.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration recorder.

                 For customer managed configuration recorders, Config automat-
                 ically assigns the name of "default" when creating a configu-
                 ration  recorder  if  you  do  not specify a name at creation
                 time.

                 For service-linked configuration recorders, Config  automati-
                 cally assigns a name that has the prefix "AWS " to a new ser-
                 vice-linked configuration recorder.

                 NOTE:
                        Changing the name of a configuration recorder

                     To change the name of the customer managed  configuration
                     recorder,  you  must  delete it and create a new customer
                     managed configuration recorder with a new name.

                     You cannot change the name of a service-linked configura-
                     tion recorder.

              roleARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role assumed by
                 Config and used by the specified configuration recorder.

                 NOTE:
                        The server will reject a  request  without  a  defined
                        ``roleARN`` for the configuration recorder

                     While  the  API  model  does  not require this field, the
                     server will reject a request without  a  defined  roleARN
                     for the configuration recorder.
                        Policies and compliance results

                        IAM  policies  and other policies managed in Organiza-
                        tions can impact whether  Config  has  permissions  to
                        record configuration changes for your resources. Addi-
                        tionally, rules directly evaluate the configuration of
                        a  resource  and  rules  don't take into account these
                        policies when running evaluations. Make sure that  the
                        policies  in  effect  align with how you intend to use
                        Config.

                        Keep Minimum Permisions When Reusing an IAM role

                     If you use an Amazon Web Services service that uses  Con-
                     fig,  such  as  Security Hub or Control Tower, and an IAM
                     role has already been created, make  sure  that  the  IAM
                     role  that  you use when setting up Config keeps the same
                     minimum permissions as the  pre-existing  IAM  role.  You
                     must do this to ensure that the other Amazon Web Services
                     service continues to run as expected.

                     For example, if Control Tower has an IAM role that allows
                     Config  to  read S3 objects, make sure that the same per-
                     missions are granted to the IAM role you use when setting
                     up  Config.  Otherwise, it may interfere with how Control
                     Tower operates.
                        The service-linked IAM role for Config  must  be  used
                        for service-linked configuration recorders

                     For  service-linked configuration recorders, you must use
                     the    service-linked    IAM     role     for     Config:
                     AWSServiceRoleForConfig .

              recordingGroup -> (structure)
                 Specifies  which resource types are in scope for the configu-
                 ration recorder to record.

                 NOTE:
                        High Number of Config Evaluations

                     You might notice increased activity in your account  dur-
                     ing  your  initial  month recording with Config when com-
                     pared to subsequent months. During the initial bootstrap-
                     ping  process,  Config  runs  evaluations  on all the re-
                     sources in your account that you have selected for Config
                     to record.

                     If  you  are running ephemeral workloads, you may see in-
                     creased activity from Config as it records  configuration
                     changes  associated with creating and deleting these tem-
                     porary resources. An ephemeral workload  is  a  temporary
                     use  of  computing resources that are loaded and run when
                     needed. Examples include  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
                     (Amazon  EC2)  Spot  Instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and Auto
                     Scaling.

                     If you want to avoid the increased activity from  running
                     ephemeral  workloads,  you  can  set up the configuration
                     recorder to  exclude  these  resource  types  from  being
                     recorded,  or  run these types of workloads in a separate
                     account with Config turned off to avoid increased config-
                     uration recording and rule evaluations.

                 allSupported -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Config  records configuration changes
                     for all supported resource types,  excluding  the  global
                     IAM resource types.

                     If  you set this field to true , when Config adds support
                     for a new resource  type,  Config  starts  recording  re-
                     sources of that type automatically.

                     If you set this field to true , you cannot enumerate spe-
                     cific resource types to record in the resourceTypes field
                     of  RecordingGroup  ,  or to exclude in the resourceTypes
                     field of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                            Region availability

                        Check Resource Coverage by Region Availability to  see
                        if a resource type is supported in the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Region where you set up Config.

                 includeGlobalResourceTypes -> (boolean)
                     This option is a bundle which only applies to the  global
                     IAM  resource  types:  IAM users, groups, roles, and cus-
                     tomer managed policies. These global IAM  resource  types
                     can  only  be  recorded by Config in Regions where Config
                     was available before February 2022. You cannot be  record
                     the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported by Con-
                     fig after February 2022. For a list of those Regions, see
                     Recording  Amazon  Web  Services  Resources  | Global Re-
                     sources .

                     WARNING:
                            Aurora global clusters are recorded in all enabled
                            Regions

                        The  AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster  resource  type  will  be
                        recorded in all supported  Config  Regions  where  the
                        configuration  recorder  is  enabled, even if include-
                        GlobalResourceTypes is set``false`` . The includeGlob-
                        alResourceTypes  option is a bundle which only applies

                        policies.

                        If  you  do not want to record AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster
                        in all enabled  Regions,  use  one  of  the  following
                        recording strategies:

                        o Record  all  current  and future resource types with
                          exclusions (EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES ), or

                        o Record  specific  resource  types  (INCLUSION_BY_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES ).

                        For  more  information,  see Selecting Which Resources
                        are Recorded in the Config developer guide .

                     WARNING:
                            includeGlobalResourceTypes   and   the   exclusion
                            recording strategy

                        The  includeGlobalResourceTypes field has no impact on
                        the  EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES  recording  strategy.
                        This  means  that  the  global IAM resource types (IAM
                        users, groups, roles, and customer  managed  policies)
                        will  not be automatically added as exclusions for ex-
                        clusionByResourceTypes when includeGlobalResourceTypes
                        is set to false .

                        The  includeGlobalResourceTypes  field  should only be
                        used to modify the AllSupported field, as the  default
                        for  the AllSupported field is to record configuration
                        changes for all supported resource types excluding the
                        global  IAM  resource types. To include the global IAM
                        resource types when AllSupported is set to true , make
                        sure to set includeGlobalResourceTypes to true .

                        To  exclude  the global IAM resource types for the EX-
                        CLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES recording strategy, you need
                        to manually add them to the resourceTypes field of ex-
                        clusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                            Required and optional fields

                        Before you set this field to true ,  set  the  allSup-
                        ported  field  of RecordingGroup to true . Optionally,
                        you can set the useOnly field of RecordingStrategy  to
                        ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                     NOTE:
                            Overriding fields

                        If you set this field to false but list global IAM re-
                        source   types   in   the   resourceTypes   field   of
                        RecordingGroup  ,  Config will still record configura-
                        tion changes for those specified  resource  types  re-
                        gardless  of if you set the includeGlobalResourceTypes
                        field to false.

                        If you do not want to record configuration changes  to
                        the  global  IAM  resource  types  (IAM users, groups,
                        roles, and customer managed policies),  make  sure  to
                        not  list  them in the resourceTypes field in addition
                        to setting  the  includeGlobalResourceTypes  field  to
                        false.

                 resourceTypes -> (list)
                     A  comma-separated  list  that  specifies  which resource
                     types Config records.

                     For a list of valid resourceTypes  values,  see  the  Re-
                     source Type Value column in Supported Amazon Web Services
                     resource Types in the Config developer guide .

                     NOTE:
                            Required and optional fields

                        Optionally,  you  can  set  the   useOnly   field   of
                        RecordingStrategy to INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                        To  record  all configuration changes, set the allSup-
                        ported field of RecordingGroup to true  ,  and  either
                        omit this field or don't specify any resource types in
                        this field. If you set the allSupported field to false
                        and  specify  values  for  resourceTypes , when Config
                        adds support for a new type of resource, it  will  not
                        record  resources of that type unless you manually add
                        that type to your recording group.

                     NOTE:
                            Region availability

                        Before specifying a resource type for Config to track,
                        check  Resource Coverage by Region Availability to see
                        if the resource type is supported in  the  Amazon  Web
                        Services Region where you set up Config. If a resource
                        type is supported by Config in at  least  one  Region,
                        you  can enable the recording of that resource type in
                        all Regions supported by Config, even if the specified
                        resource  type is not supported in the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Region where you set up Config.

                     (string)

                 exclusionByResourceTypes -> (structure)
                     An object that specifies  how  Config  excludes  resource
                     types from being recorded by the configuration recorder.

                     NOTE:
                            Required fields

                        To  use this option, you must set the useOnly field of
                        RecordingStrategy to EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES .

                     resourceTypes -> (list)
                        A comma-separated list of resource  types  to  exclude
                        from recording by the configuration recorder.

                        (string)

                 recordingStrategy -> (structure)
                     An  object  that specifies the recording strategy for the
                     configuration recorder.

                     o If you set the useOnly field  of  RecordingStrategy  to
                       ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES  , Config records configu-
                       ration changes for all supported  resource  types,  ex-
                       cluding  the  global  IAM resource types. You also must
                       set the allSupported field of RecordingGroup to true  .
                       When  Config adds support for a new resource type, Con-
                       fig automatically starts recording  resources  of  that
                       type.

                     o If  you  set  the useOnly field of RecordingStrategy to
                       INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES , Config records configura-
                       tion changes for only the resource types you specify in
                       the resourceTypes field of RecordingGroup .

                     o If you set the useOnly field  of  RecordingStrategy  to
                       EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES , Config records configura-
                       tion changes for all supported  resource  types  except
                       the resource types that you specify to exclude from be-
                       ing   recorded   in   the   resourceTypes   field    of
                       ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                            Required and optional fields

                        The  recordingStrategy  field is optional when you set
                        the allSupported field of RecordingGroup to true .

                        The recordingStrategy field is optional when you  list
                        resource   types   in   the   resourceTypes  field  of
                        RecordingGroup .

                        The recordingStrategy field is required  if  you  list
                        resource  types  to  exclude from recording in the re-
                        sourceTypes field of ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                     NOTE:
                            Overriding fields

                        If  you  choose  EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES  for  the
                        recording strategy, the exclusionByResourceTypes field
                        will override other properties in the request.

                        For example, even if  you  set  includeGlobalResource-
                        Types  to  false, global IAM resource types will still
                        be automatically recorded in this option unless  those
                        resource  types  are specifically listed as exclusions
                        in the resourceTypes field of exclusionByResourceTypes
                        .

                     NOTE:
                            Global  resources types and the resource exclusion
                            recording strategy

                        By  default,  if  you  choose   the   EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                        SOURCE_TYPES recording strategy, when Config adds sup-
                        port for a new resource type in the Region  where  you
                        set  up  the  configuration recorder, including global
                        resource types, Config starts recording  resources  of
                        that type automatically.

                        Unless     specifically    listed    as    exclusions,
                        AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster will be recorded automatically
                        in all supported Config Regions were the configuration
                        recorder is enabled.

                        IAM users, groups, roles, and customer  managed  poli-
                        cies  will  be recorded in the Region where you set up
                        the configuration recorder if that is a  Region  where
                        Config  was available before February 2022. You cannot
                        be record the global IAM resouce types in Regions sup-

                        those Regions, see Recording Amazon Web  Services  Re-
                        sources | Global Resources .

                     useOnly -> (string)
                        The recording strategy for the configuration recorder.

                        o If   you   set   this  option  to  ALL_SUPPORTED_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES , Config records configuration  changes
                          for  all  supported  resource  types,  excluding the
                          global IAM resource types. You  also  must  set  the
                          allSupported  field of RecordingGroup to true . When
                          Config adds support for a new resource type,  Config
                          automatically  starts  recording  resources  of that
                          type. For a list of supported  resource  types,  see
                          Supported  Resource  Types  in  the Config developer
                          guide .

                        o If  you  set   this   option   to   INCLUSION_BY_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES  , Config records configuration changes
                          for only the resource types that you specify in  the
                          resourceTypes field of RecordingGroup .

                        o If   you   set   this   option  to  EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                          SOURCE_TYPES , Config records configuration  changes
                          for  all  supported  resource  types, except the re-
                          source types that you specify to exclude from  being
                          recorded    in    the    resourceTypes    field   of
                          ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                        NOTE:
                               Required and optional fields

                            The recordingStrategy field is optional  when  you
                            set  the  allSupported  field of RecordingGroup to
                            true .

                            The recordingStrategy field is optional  when  you
                            list  resource types in the resourceTypes field of
                            RecordingGroup .

                            The recordingStrategy field  is  required  if  you
                            list  resource  types to exclude from recording in
                            the         resourceTypes         field         of
                            ExclusionByResourceTypes .

                        NOTE:
                               Overriding fields

                            If  you choose EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES for the
                            recording strategy,  the  exclusionByResourceTypes
                            field  will  override  other properties in the re-
                            quest.

                            For example,  even  if  you  set  includeGlobalRe-
                            sourceTypes  to  false,  global IAM resource types
                            will still be automatically recorded in  this  op-
                            tion  unless those resource types are specifically
                            listed as exclusions in the resourceTypes field of
                            exclusionByResourceTypes .

                        NOTE:
                               Global resource types and the exclusion record-
                               ing strategy

                            By default, if  you  choose  the  EXCLUSION_BY_RE-
                            SOURCE_TYPES  recording strategy, when Config adds
                            support for a new  resource  type  in  the  Region
                            where  you  set up the configuration recorder, in-
                            cluding  global  resource  types,  Config   starts
                            recording resources of that type automatically.

                            Unless    specifically   listed   as   exclusions,
                            AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster will be recorded automati-
                            cally  in  all  supported  Config Regions were the
                            configuration recorder is enabled.

                            IAM users, groups,  roles,  and  customer  managed
                            policies  will be recorded in the Region where you
                            set up the configuration recorder if that is a Re-
                            gion  where  Config  was available before February
                            2022. You cannot be record the global IAM  resouce

                            global  IAM  resource types includes the following
                            Regions:

                            o Asia Pacific (Hyderabad)

                            o Asia Pacific (Melbourne)

                            o Europe (Zurich)

                            o Israel (Tel Aviv)

                            o Middle East (UAE)

              recordingMode -> (structure)
                 Specifies the default recording frequency for the  configura-
                 tion recorder. Config supports Continuous recording and Daily
                 recording .

                 o Continuous recording allows  you  to  record  configuration
                   changes continuously whenever a change occurs.

                 o Daily  recording allows you to receive a configuration item
                   (CI) representing the most recent state of  your  resources
                   over  the  last  24-hour period, only if its different from
                   the previous CI recorded.

                 NOTE:
                        Some resource types require continuous recording

                     Firewall Manager depends on continuous recording to moni-
                     tor your resources. If you are using Firewall Manager, it
                     is recommended that you set the  recording  frequency  to
                     Continuous.

                 You  can  also  override the recording frequency for specific
                 resource types.

                 recordingFrequency -> (string)
                     The default  recording  frequency  that  Config  uses  to
                     record configuration changes.

                     WARNING:
                        Daily  recording cannot be specified for the following
