GET-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-DETGET-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-DETAILED-STATUS()



NAME
       get-organization-config-rule-detailed-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed status for each member account within an organization
       for a given organization Config rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-organization-config-rule-detailed-status is a paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of  the  following  query expressions: OrganizationConfigRuleDe-
       tailedStatus

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name of your organization Config rule for which you want  status
          details for member accounts.

       --filters (structure)
          A StatusDetailFilters object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit account ID of the member account within an organi-
              zation.

          MemberAccountRuleStatus -> (string)
              Indicates deployment status for Config rule in  the  member  ac-
              count.  When  master account calls PutOrganizationConfigRule ac-
              tion for the first time, Config rule status is  created  in  the
              member  account. When master account calls PutOrganizationConfi-
              gRule action for the second time, Config rule status is  updated
              in  the  member  account. Config rule status is deleted when the
              master account deletes OrganizationConfigRule and disables  ser-
              vice access for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

              Config sets the state of the rule to:

              o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL  when  Config  rule  has been created in the
                member account.

              o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when Config rule is being  created  in  the
                member account.

              o CREATE_FAILED when Config rule creation has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

              o DELETE_FAILED when Config rule deletion has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

              o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  Config  rule is being deleted in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when Config rule has  been  deleted  in  the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL  when  Config  rule  has been updated in the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when Config rule is being  updated  in  the
                member account.

              o UPDATE_FAILED when Config rule deletion has failed in the mem-
                ber account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,MemberAccountRuleStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "MemberAccountRuleStatus": "CREATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"CREATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_SUCCESSFUL"|"DELETE_FAILED"|"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

              Organization Config rule creation or  deletion  status  in  each
              member  account. This includes the name of the rule, the status,
              error code and error message when the rule creation or  deletion
              failed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit account ID of a member account.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of Config rule deployed in the member account.

              MemberAccountRuleStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status for Config rule in the member ac-

                 gRule  and  disables  service  access   for   config-multiac-
                 countsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the rule to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL  when Config rule has been created in the
                   member account.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when Config rule is being created in the
