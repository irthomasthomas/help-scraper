PUT-DELIVERY-CHANNEL()                                  PUT-DELIVERY-CHANNEL()



NAME
       put-delivery-channel -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a delivery channel object to deliver configuration information
       to an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon SNS topic.

       Before you can create a delivery channel, you must create a  configura-
       tion recorder.

       You can use this action to change the Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon SNS
       topic of the existing delivery channel. To change the Amazon S3  bucket
       or an Amazon SNS topic, call this action and specify the changed values
       for the S3 bucket and the SNS topic. If you specify a  different  value
       for  either  the  S3 bucket or the SNS topic, this action will keep the
       existing value for the parameter that is not changed.

       NOTE:
          You can have only one delivery channel per region in your account.

OPTIONS
       --delivery-channel (structure)
          The configuration delivery channel object that delivers the configu-
          ration  information  to  an  Amazon  S3  bucket and to an Amazon SNS
          topic.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the delivery channel. By default, Config assigns the
              name "default" when creating the delivery channel. To change the
              delivery channel name, you must  use  the  DeleteDeliveryChannel
              action  to  delete  your  current delivery channel, and then you
              must use the PutDeliveryChannel command  to  create  a  delivery
              channel that has the desired name.

          s3BucketName -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to which Config delivers con-
              figuration snapshots and configuration history files.

              If you specify a bucket that belongs to another Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  account, that bucket must have policies that grant access
              permissions to Config. For more information, see Permissions for
              the Amazon S3 Bucket in the Config Developer Guide .

          s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
              The prefix for the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

          s3KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Key Management Service
              (KMS ) KMS key (KMS key) used to encrypt  objects  delivered  by
              Config.  Must  belong  to  the same Region as the destination S3
              bucket.

          snsTopicARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to  which
              Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

              If  you choose a topic from another account, the topic must have
              policies that grant access permissions to Config. For  more  in-
              formation,  see Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic in the Con-
              fig Developer Guide .

          configSnapshotDeliveryProperties -> (structure)
              The options for how often Config  delivers  configuration  snap-
              shots to the Amazon S3 bucket.

              deliveryFrequency -> (string)
                 The  frequency with which Config delivers configuration snap-
                 shots.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,s3BucketName=string,s3KeyPrefix=string,s3KmsKeyArn=string,snsTopicARN=string,configSnapshotDeliveryProperties={deliveryFrequency=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "s3BucketName": "string",
            "s3KeyPrefix": "string",
            "s3KmsKeyArn": "string",
            "snsTopicARN": "string",
            "configSnapshotDeliveryProperties": {
              "deliveryFrequency": "One_Hour"|"Three_Hours"|"Six_Hours"|"Twelve_Hours"|"TwentyFour_Hours"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a delivery channel

       The following command provides the settings for the delivery channel as
       JSON code:

          aws configservice put-delivery-channel --delivery-channel file://deliveryChannel.json

       The  deliveryChannel.json  file  specifies  the  delivery  channel  at-
       tributes:

          {
              "name": "default",
              "s3BucketName": "config-bucket-123456789012",
              "snsTopicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:config-topic",
              "configSnapshotDeliveryProperties": {
                  "deliveryFrequency": "Twelve_Hours"
              }
          }

       This example sets the following attributes:

       o name - The name of the delivery channel. By default, AWS  Config  as-
         signs the name default to a new delivery channel.

         You  cannot  update  the  delivery  channel  name with the put-deliv-
         ery-channel command. For the steps to change the name,  see  Renaming
         the Delivery Channel.

       o s3BucketName  -  The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which AWS Config
         delivers configuration snapshots and configuration history files.

         If you specify a bucket that belongs to  another  AWS  account,  that
         bucket  must  have policies that grant access permissions to AWS Con-
         fig. For more information, see Permissions for the Amazon S3 Bucket.

       o snsTopicARN - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS  topic
         to which AWS Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

         If you choose a topic from another account, the topic must have poli-
         cies that grant access permissions to AWS Config. For  more  informa-
         tion, see Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic.

       o configSnapshotDeliveryProperties - Contains the deliveryFrequency at-
         tribute, which sets how often AWS Config delivers configuration snap-
         shots and how often it invokes evaluations for periodic Config rules.

       If  the  command  succeeds, AWS Config returns no output. To verify the
       settings of your delivery channel, run  the  describe-delivery-channels
       command.

OUTPUT
       None
