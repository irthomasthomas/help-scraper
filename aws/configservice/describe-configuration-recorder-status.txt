DESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER-STATUSDESCRIBE-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-configuration-recorder-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the current status of the configuration recorder you specify as
       well as the status of the last recording event  for  the  configuration
       recorders.

       For  a  detailed  status of recording events over time, add your Config
       events to Amazon CloudWatch metrics and use CloudWatch metrics.

       If a configuration recorder is not specified,  this  operation  returns
       the  status  for the customer managed configuration recorder configured
       for the account, if applicable.

       NOTE:
          When making a request to this operation, you can  only  specify  one
          configuration recorder.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-names (list)
          The  name  of  the configuration recorder. If the name is not speci-
          fied, the opertation returns the status  for  the  customer  managed
          configuration recorder configured for the account, if applicable.

          NOTE:
              When  making  a  request to this operation, you can only specify
              one configuration recorder.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --service-principal (string)
          For service-linked configuration recorders, you can use the  service
          principal  of  the linked Amazon Web Services service to specify the
          configuration recorder.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  configuration  recorder  that
          you want to specify.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get status information for the configuration recorder

       The following command returns the status of the  default  configuration
