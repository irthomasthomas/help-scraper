LIST-CONFORMANCE-PACK-COMPLIANCE-SCORLIST-CONFORMANCE-PACK-COMPLIANCE-SCORES()



NAME
       list-conformance-pack-compliance-scores -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  conformance  pack compliance scores. A compliance
       score is the percentage of the number of compliant rule-resource combi-
       nations  in a conformance pack compared to the number of total possible
       rule-resource combinations in the conformance pack.  This  metric  pro-
       vides  you  with a high-level view of the compliance state of your con-
       formance packs, and can be used to identify,  investigate,  and  under-
       stand the level of compliance in your conformance packs.

       NOTE:
          Conformance  packs with no evaluation results will have a compliance
          score of INSUFFICIENT_DATA .

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          Filters the results based on the ConformancePackComplianceScoresFil-
          ters .

          ConformancePackNames -> (list)
              The  names  of the conformance packs whose compliance scores you
              want to include in the conformance pack compliance score  result
              set.  You  can include up to 25 conformance packs in the Confor-
              mancePackNames array of strings, each with a character limit  of
              256 characters for the conformance pack name.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConformancePackNames=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConformancePackNames": ["string", ...]
          }

       --sort-order (string)
          Determines the order in which conformance pack compliance scores are
          sorted. Either in ascending or descending order.

          Conformance packs with a compliance score of INSUFFICIENT_DATA  will
          be  first  when  sorting by ascending order and last when sorting by
          descending order.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --sort-by (string)
          Sorts your conformance pack compliance scores in either ascending or
          descending order, depending on SortOrder .

          By default, conformance pack compliance scores are sorted in ascend-
          ing order by compliance score and alphabetically by name of the con-
          formance  pack  if  there is more than one conformance pack with the
          same compliance score.

          Possible values:

          o SCORE

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of conformance pack compliance scores returned on
          each page.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken string in a prior request that you can use to get the
          paginated response for  next  set  of  conformance  pack  compliance
          scores.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string that you can use to get the next  page  of  re-
          sults in a paginated response.

       ConformancePackComplianceScores -> (list)
          A list of ConformancePackComplianceScore objects.

          (structure)
              A  compliance score is the percentage of the number of compliant
              rule-resource combinations in a conformance pack compared to the
              number  of total possible rule-resource combinations in the con-
              formance pack. This metric provides you with a  high-level  view
              of  the  compliance  state of your conformance packs, and can be
              used to identify, investigate, and understand the level of  com-
              pliance in your conformance packs.

              Score -> (string)
                 Compliance  score for the conformance pack. Conformance packs
                 with no evaluation results will have a  compliance  score  of
                 INSUFFICIENT_DATA .

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name of the conformance pack.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time that the conformance pack compliance score was last
                 updated.
