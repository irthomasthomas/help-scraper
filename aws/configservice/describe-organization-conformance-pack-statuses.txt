DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMDESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACK-STATUSES()



NAME
       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organi-
       zation.

       NOTE:
          The status is not considered successful until  organization  confor-
          mance  pack is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with
          an exception of excluded accounts.

          When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive  a  pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify organization conformance pack names. They are  only  applicable,
          when you request all the organization conformance packs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses  is  a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query  expressions:  OrganizationCon-
       formancePackStatuses

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-names (list)
          The  names of organization conformance packs for which you want sta-
          tus details. If you do not specify any names, Config returns details
          for all your organization conformance packs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConformancePackStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConformancePackStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Returns  the  status  for an organization conformance pack in an
              organization.

              OrganizationConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization conformance pack.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status of  an  organization  conformance
                 pack.  When  master  account  calls PutOrganizationConforman-
                 cePack for the first time, conformance pack status is created
                 in  all the member accounts. When master account calls PutOr-
                 ganizationConformancePack for the  second  time,  conformance
                 pack  status is updated in all the member accounts. Addition-
                 ally, conformance pack status is updated  when  one  or  more
                 member  accounts  join  or leave an organization. Conformance
                 pack status is deleted when the master account deletes  Orga-
                 nizationConformancePack  in  all the member accounts and dis-
                 ables  service  access  for  config-multiaccountsetup.amazon-
                 aws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully created in all the member accounts.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when an  organization  conformance  pack
                   creation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  when  an  organization conformance pack cre-
                   ation failed in one or more member accounts within that or-
                   ganization.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  when  an organization conformance pack dele-
                   tion failed in one or more member accounts within that  or-
                   ganization.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an  organization conformance pack
                   deletion is in progress.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully updated in all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when an  organization  conformance  pack
                   update is in progress.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED  when an organization conformance pack update
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An  error code that is returned when organization conformance
                 pack creation or deletion has failed in a member account.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An error message  indicating  that  organization  conformance
                 pack creation or deletion failed due to an error.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
