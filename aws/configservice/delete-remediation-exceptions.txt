NAME
       delete-remediation-exceptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or  more remediation exceptions mentioned in the resource
       keys.

       NOTE:
          Config generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs  exe-
          cuting  a remediation action to a specific resource. Remediation ex-
          ceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared.

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule for which you want to delete remediation
          exception configuration.

       --resource-keys (list)
          An  exception  list  of resource exception keys to be processed with
          the current request. Config adds exception for  each  resource  key.
          For example, Config adds 3 exceptions for 3 resource keys.

          (structure)
              The  details  that  identify a resource within Config, including
              the resource type and resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       FailedBatches -> (list)
          Returns a list of failed delete  remediation  exceptions  batch  ob-
          jects.  Each  object in the batch consists of a list of failed items
          and failure messages.

          (structure)
              List of each of the failed delete  remediation  exceptions  with
              specific reasons.

              FailureMessage -> (string)
                 Returns  a  failure message for delete remediation exception.
                 For example, Config creates an exception due to  an  internal
                 error.

              FailedItems -> (list)
                 Returns  remediation  exception  resource  key  object of the
                 failed items.

                 (structure)
                     The details that identify a resource within  Config,  in-
                     cluding the resource type and resource ID.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The type of a resource.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).
