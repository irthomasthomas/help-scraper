PUT-REMEDIATION-CONFIGURATIONS()              PUT-REMEDIATION-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       put-remediation-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates  the remediation configuration with a specific Config
       rule with the selected target or action. The API creates  the  Remedia-
       tionConfiguration  object for the Config rule. The Config rule must al-
       ready exist for you to add a remediation configuration. The target (SSM
       document) must exist and have permissions to use the target.

       NOTE:
          If  you  make backward incompatible changes to the SSM document, you
          must call this again to ensure the remediations can run.

          This API does not support adding remediation configurations for ser-
          vice-linked  Config  Rules  such  as  Organization Config rules, the
          rules deployed by conformance packs, and rules  deployed  by  Amazon
          Web Services Security Hub.

       NOTE:
          For  manual  remediation  configuration, you need to provide a value
          for automationAssumeRole or use a value in the assumeRole  field  to
          remediate your resources. The SSM automation document can use either
          as long as it maps to a valid parameter.

          However, for automatic remediation configuration, the only valid as-
          sumeRole field value is AutomationAssumeRole and you need to provide
          a value for AutomationAssumeRole to remediate your resources.

          A list of remediation configuration objects.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details about the remediation con-
              figuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and

                 ment.

                 NOTE:
                     If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM doc-
                     ument,  you  must  call  PutRemediationConfiguration  API
                     again to ensure the remediations can run.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 An object of the RemediationParameterValue.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The value is either  a  dynamic  (resource)  value  or  a
                     static value. You must select either a dynamic value or a
                     static value.

                     ResourceValue -> (structure)
                        The value is dynamic and changes at run-time.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value is a resource ID.

                     StaticValue -> (structure)
                        The value is static and does not change at run-time.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A list of values. For example, the ARN of the  as-
                            sumed role.

                            (string)

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              Automatic -> (boolean)
                 The remediation is triggered automatically.

              ExecutionControls -> (structure)
                 An ExecutionControls object.

                 SsmControls -> (structure)
                     A SsmControls object.

                     ConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage -> (integer)
                        The  maximum percentage of remediation actions allowed
                        to run in parallel on the non-compliant resources  for
                        that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such
                        as 10%. The default value is 10.

                     ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                        The percentage of errors that are allowed  before  SSM
                        stops  running  automations on non-compliant resources
                        for that specific rule. You can specify  a  percentage
                        of  errors,  for example 10%. If you do not specifiy a
                        percentage, the default is 50%. For  example,  if  you
                        set  the  ErrorPercentage  to 40% for 10 non-compliant
                        resources, then SSM stops running the automations when
                        the fifth error is received.

              MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of failed attempts for auto-remediation.
                 If you do not select a number, the default is 5.

                 For example, if you  specify  MaximumAutomaticAttempts  as  5
                 with RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds, Config will put a Re-
                 mediationException on your behalf for  the  failing  resource
                 after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.

              RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                 Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remediation. If
                 you do not select a number, the default is 60 seconds.

                 For example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds
                 and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will run auto-reme-
                 diations 5 times within 50 seconds before throwing an  excep-
                 tion.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.

              CreatedByService -> (string)
                 Name of the service that owns the service-linked rule, if ap-
                 plicable.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                               allowed to run in parallel on the non-compliant
                               resources for that specific rule. You can spec-
                               ify a percentage,  such  as  10%.  The  default
                               value is 10.

                            ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                               The  percentage  of errors that are allowed be-
                               fore SSM stops running automations on  non-com-
                               pliant  resources  for  that specific rule. You
                               can specify a percentage of errors, for example
                               10%.  If  you do not specifiy a percentage, the
                               default is 50%. For example, if you set the Er-
                               rorPercentage  to  40% for 10 non-compliant re-
                               sources, then SSM stops running the automations
                               when the fifth error is received.

                     MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                        The maximum number of failed attempts for auto-remedi-
                        ation. If you do not select a number, the  default  is
                        5.

                        For  example,  if you specify MaximumAutomaticAttempts
                        as 5 with RetryAttemptSeconds as  50  seconds,  Config
                        will put a RemediationException on your behalf for the
                        failing resource after the 5th failed  attempt  within
                        50 seconds.

                     RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                        Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remedia-
                        tion. If you do not select a number, the default is 60
                        seconds.

                        For  example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50
                        seconds and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will
                        run auto-remediations 5 times within 50 seconds before
                        throwing an exception.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  remediation  configura-
                        tion.

                     CreatedByService -> (string)
                        Name of the service that owns the service-linked rule,
                        if applicable.
