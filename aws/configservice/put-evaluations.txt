PUT-EVALUATIONS()                                            PUT-EVALUATIONS()



NAME
       put-evaluations -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  an  Lambda  function to deliver evaluation results to Config.
       This action is required in every Lambda function that is invoked by  an
       Config rule.

OPTIONS
       --evaluations (list)
          The  assessments  that the Lambda function performs. Each evaluation
          identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether  it
          complies with the Config rule that invokes the Lambda function.

          (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether
              it complies with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

              ComplianceResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource  that  was  evalu-
                 ated.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the Amazon Web Services resource complies
                 with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

                 For the Evaluation data type, Config supports only  the  COM-
                 PLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  , and NOT_APPLICABLE values. Config
                 does not support the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value  for  this  data
                 type.

                 Similarly,  Config  does  not accept INSUFFICIENT_DATA as the
                 value for ComplianceType from a PutEvaluations  request.  For
                 example,  an  Lambda function for a custom Config rule cannot
                 pass an INSUFFICIENT_DATA value to Config.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  of  the event in Config that triggered the evalua-
                 tion. For event-based evaluations, the  time  indicates  when
                 Config  created  the  configuration  item  that triggered the
                 evaluation. For periodic evaluations, the time indicates when
                 Config  triggered  the  evaluation  at the frequency that you
                 specified (for example, every 24 hours).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ComplianceResourceType=string,ComplianceResourceId=string,ComplianceType=string,Annotation=string,OrderingTimestamp=timestamp ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ComplianceResourceType": "string",
              "ComplianceResourceId": "string",
              "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"NOT_APPLICABLE"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
              "Annotation": "string",
              "OrderingTimestamp": timestamp
            }
            ...
          ]

       --result-token (string)
          An encrypted token that associates  an  evaluation  with  an  Config
          rule.  Identifies  the rule and the event that triggered the evalua-
          tion.

       --test-mode | --no-test-mode (boolean)
          Use this parameter to specify a test run for  PutEvaluations  .  You
          can  verify whether your Lambda function will deliver evaluation re-
          sults to Config. No updates occur to your existing evaluations,  and
          evaluation results are not sent to Config.

          NOTE:
              When  TestMode  is true , PutEvaluations doesn't require a valid
              value for the ResultToken parameter, but  the  value  cannot  be
              null.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FailedEvaluations -> (list)
          Requests that failed because of a client or server error.

          (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether
              it complies with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

              ComplianceResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services resource that was evalu-
                 ated.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services  resource  complies
                 with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

                 For  the  Evaluation data type, Config supports only the COM-
                 PLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and  NOT_APPLICABLE  values.  Config
                 does  not  support  the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value for this data
                 type.

                 Similarly, Config does not accept  INSUFFICIENT_DATA  as  the
                 value  for  ComplianceType from a PutEvaluations request. For
                 example, an Lambda function for a custom Config  rule  cannot
                 pass an INSUFFICIENT_DATA value to Config.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the event in Config that  triggered  the  evalua-
                 tion.  For  event-based  evaluations, the time indicates when
                 Config created the  configuration  item  that  triggered  the
                 evaluation. For periodic evaluations, the time indicates when
                 Config triggered the evaluation at  the  frequency  that  you
                 specified (for example, every 24 hours).
