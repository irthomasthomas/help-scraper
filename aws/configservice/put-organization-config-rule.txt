NAME
       put-organization-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds or updates an Config rule for your entire organization to evaluate
       if your Amazon Web Services resources comply with your desired configu-
       rations.  For information on how many organization Config rules you can
       have      per      account,      see       `       Service       Limits
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/configlimits.html`__
       in the Config Developer Guide .

       Only a master account and a delegated administrator can create  or  up-
       date  an  organization  Config rule. When calling this API with a dele-
       gated administrator, you must ensure Organizations  ListDelegatedAdmin-
       istrator  permissions are added. An organization can have up to 3 dele-
       gated administrators.

       This API enables organization service access through the  EnableAWSSer-
       viceAccess  action and creates a service-linked role AWSServiceRoleFor-
       ConfigMultiAccountSetup in the master or  delegated  administrator  ac-
       count  of  your  organization.  The service-linked role is created only
       when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the
       existence of role with GetRole action.

       To  use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated ad-
       ministrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization  register-dele-
       gated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

       There  are  two  types of rules: Config Custom Rules and Config Managed
       Rules. You can use PutOrganizationConfigRule to create both Config cus-
       tom rules and Config managed rules.

       Custom rules are rules that you can create using either Guard or Lambda
       functions. Guard (Guard GitHub Repository ) is  a  policy-as-code  lan-
       guage  that  allows  you  to write policies that are enforced by Config
       Custom Policy rules. Lambda uses custom code that you upload to  evalu-
       ate  a  custom  rule.  If  you are adding a new Custom Lambda rule, you
       first need to create an Lambda function in the master account or a del-
       egated  administrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources.
       You also need to create an IAM role in the managed account that can  be
       assumed  by the Lambda function. When you use PutOrganizationConfigRule
       to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon  Re-
       source Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function.

       Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For
       a list of managed rules, see List of Config Managed Rules . If you  are
       adding  an  Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier
       for the RuleIdentifier key.

       NOTE:
          Prerequisite: Ensure you call EnableAllFeatures API  to  enable  all
          features in an organization.

          Make sure to specify one of either OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMeta-
          data for Custom  Policy  rules,  OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata  for
          Custom  Lambda rules, or OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata for managed
          rules.

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name that you assign to an organization Config rule.

       --organization-managed-rule-metadata (structure)
          An OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata object. This object specifies or-
          ganization  managed  rule  metadata  such as resource type and ID of
          Amazon Web Services resource along with the rule identifier. It also
          provides the frequency with which you want Config to run evaluations
          for the rule if the trigger type is periodic.

          Description -> (string)
              The description that you provide for  your  organization  Config
              rule.

          RuleIdentifier -> (string)
              For  organization  config managed rules, a predefined identifier
              from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
              To reference a managed rule, see Using Config managed rules .

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A  string,  in  JSON format, that is passed to your organization
              Config rule Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations  for  a
              rule.  This is for an Config managed rule that is triggered at a
              periodic frequency.

              NOTE:
                 By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every
                 24  hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for
                 the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

          ResourceTypesScope -> (list)
              The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              (string)

          ResourceIdScope -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

          TagKeyScope -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral  label that acts like a category for more specific tag val-
              ues.

          TagValueScope -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

                evaluation  when  Config  delivers  an oversized configuration
                item. Config may generate this notification type  when  a  re-
                source  changes  and the notification exceeds the maximum size
                allowed by Amazon SNS.

              o ScheduledNotification - Triggers a periodic evaluation at  the
                frequency specified for MaximumExecutionFrequency .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization Config rule.
