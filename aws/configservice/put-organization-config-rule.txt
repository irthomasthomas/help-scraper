PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()                  PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       put-organization-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates organization Config rule for your entire organization
       evaluating whether your Amazon Web Services resources comply with  your
       desired configurations.

       Only  a  master account and a delegated administrator can create or up-
       date an organization Config rule. When calling this API  with  a  dele-
       gated  administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdmin-
       istrator permissions are added.

       This API enables organization service access through the  EnableAWSSer-
       viceAccess  action and creates a service linked role AWSServiceRoleFor-
       ConfigMultiAccountSetup in the master or  delegated  administrator  ac-
       count  of  your  organization.  The service linked role is created only
       when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the
       existence of role with GetRole action.

       To  use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated ad-
       ministrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization  register-dele-
       gated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

       You  can  use this action to create both custom Config rules and Config
       managed rules. If you are adding a new custom  Config  rule,  you  must
       first  create  Lambda function in the master account or a delegated ad-
       ministrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. You  also
       need  to  create an IAM role in the managed-account that can be assumed
       by the Lambda function. When you use the PutOrganizationConfigRule  ac-
       tion  to  add  the rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource
       Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. If you  are  adding  an
       Config  managed rule, specify the rule's identifier for the RuleIdenti-
       fier key.

       The maximum number of organization Config rules that Config supports is
       150 and 3 delegated administrator per organization.

       NOTE:
          Prerequisite:  Ensure  you  call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all
          features in an organization.

          Specify either OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata or OrganizationManage-
          dRuleMetadata .

          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name that you assign to an organization Config rule.

       --organization-managed-rule-metadata (structure)
          An OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata object.

          Description -> (string)
              The  description  that  you provide for your organization Config
              rule.

          RuleIdentifier -> (string)
              For organization config managed rules, a  predefined  identifier
              from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
              To reference a managed rule, see Using Config managed rules .

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A string, in JSON format, that is passed  to  your  organization
              Config rule Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The  maximum  frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a
              rule. You are using an Config managed rule that is triggered  at
              a periodic frequency.

              NOTE:
                 By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every
                 24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value  for
                 the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

          ResourceTypesScope -> (list)
              The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              (string)

          ResourceIdScope -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

          TagKeyScope -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral label that acts like a category for more specific tag  val-
              ues.

          TagValueScope -> (string)
              The  optional  part  of  a  key-value pair that make up a tag. A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       --organization-custom-policy-rule-metadata (structure)
          An object that specifies metadata  for  your  organization's  Config
          Custom Policy rule. The metadata includes the runtime system in use,
          which accounts have debug logging enabled,  and  other  custom  rule
          metadata,  such as resource type, resource ID of Amazon Web Services
          resource, and organization trigger types  that  initiate  Config  to
          evaluate Amazon Web Services resources against a rule.

          Description -> (string)
              The  description  that  you provide for your organization Config
              Custom Policy rule.

              The type of notification that initiates Config to run an evalua-
              tion for a rule. For Config Custom Policy rules, Config supports
              change-initiated notification types:

              o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Initiates an  evaluation
                when Config delivers a configuration item as a result of a re-
                source change.

              o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Initiates  an
                evaluation  when  Config  delivers  an oversized configuration
                item. Config may generate this notification type  when  a  re-
                source  changes  and the notification exceeds the maximum size
                allowed by Amazon SNS.

              (string)

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A string, in JSON format, that is passed  to  your  organization
              Config Custom Policy rule.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The  maximum  frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a
              rule. Your Config Custom Policy rule is  triggered  when  Config
              delivers  the  configuration snapshot. For more information, see

              ues.

          TagValueScope -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A

              For more information about Guard, see the Guard  GitHub  Reposi-
              tory .

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization Config rule.
