NAME
       get-compliance-details-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  evaluation results for the specified Config rule. The re-
       sults indicate which Amazon Web Services resources  were  evaluated  by
       the  rule,  when each resource was last evaluated, and whether each re-
       source complies with the rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-compliance-details-by-config-rule is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: EvaluationResults

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The  name  of the Config rule for which you want compliance informa-
          tion.

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.
              INSUFFICIENT_DATA is a valid  ComplianceType  that  is  returned
              when  an  Config  rule  cannot  be  evaluated. However, INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA cannot be used as a ComplianceType for filtering  re-
              sults.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the evaluation results for an AWS Config rule

       The following command returns the evaluation results for all of the re-
       sources that don't comply with an AWS Config rule  named  InstanceType-
       sAreT2micro:

          aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name InstanceTypesAreT2micro --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

          specified Config rule.

          (structure)
              The details of an Config evaluation.  Provides  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource that was evaluated, the compliance of the re-
              source, related time stamps, and supplementary information.

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies the evaluation result.

                 EvaluationResultQualifier -> (structure)
                     Identifies an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon  Web
                     Services  resource,  and  provides the type and ID of the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services resource that was
                        evaluated.

                     ResourceId -> (string)

                     EvaluationMode -> (string)
                        The mode of an evaluation. The valid values are Detec-
                        tive or Proactive.

                 OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  of  the event that triggered the evaluation of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration  snapshot,  depending on which event triggered
                     the evaluation.

                 ResourceEvaluationId -> (string)

                 The time when Config recorded the evaluation result.

              ConfigRuleInvokedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the Config rule evaluated the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices resource.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              ResultToken -> (string)
                 An encrypted token that associates an evaluation with an Con-
                 fig  rule. The token identifies the rule, the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resource being evaluated, and the event that  triggered
                 the evaluation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
