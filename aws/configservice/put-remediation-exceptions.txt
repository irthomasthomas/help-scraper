PUT-REMEDIATION-EXCEPTIONS()                      PUT-REMEDIATION-EXCEPTIONS()



NAME
       put-remediation-exceptions -

DESCRIPTION
       A  remediation exception is when a specified resource is no longer con-
       sidered for auto-remediation. This API adds a new exception or  updates
       an  existing exception for a specified resource with a specified Config
       rule.

       NOTE:
          Config generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs  run-
          ning  a remediation action for a specified resource. Remediation ex-
          ceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared.

       NOTE:
          When placing an exception on an Amazon Web Services resource, it  is
          recommended  that remediation is set as manual remediation until the
          given Config rule for the specified resource evaluates the  resource
          as  NON_COMPLIANT . Once the resource has been evaluated as NON_COM-
          PLIANT , you can add remediation exceptions and change the  remedia-
          tion  type back from Manual to Auto if you want to use auto-remedia-
          tion. Otherwise, using auto-remediation before a NON_COMPLIANT eval-
          uation result can delete resources before the exception is applied.

       NOTE:
          Placing  an  exception  can  only be performed on resources that are
          NON_COMPLIANT . If you use this API for COMPLIANT resources  or  re-
          sources  that  are NOT_APPLICABLE , a remediation exception will not
          be generated. For more information on the conditions  that  initiate
          the  possible Config evaluation results, see Concepts | Config Rules
          in the Config Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule for which you want to create remediation
          exception.

       --resource-keys (list)
          An  exception  list  of resource exception keys to be processed with
          the current request. Config adds exception for  each  resource  key.
          For example, Config adds 3 exceptions for 3 resource keys.

          (structure)
              The  details  that  identify a resource within Config, including
              the resource type and resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --message (string)
          The message contains an explanation of the exception.

       --expiration-time (timestamp)
          The exception is automatically deleted after the expiration date.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
