NAME
       get-compliance-details-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  evaluation  results for the specified Amazon Web Services
       resource. The results indicate which Config rules were used to evaluate
       the resource, when each rule was last invoked, and whether the resource
       complies with each rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-compliance-details-by-resource is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: EvaluationResults

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The type of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you want com-
          pliance information.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you  want  com-
          pliance information.

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          The  allowed values are COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and NOT_APPLICA-
          BLE .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --resource-evaluation-id (string)
          The unique ID of Amazon Web Services resource  execution  for  which
          you want to retrieve evaluation results.

          NOTE:
              You  need to only provide either a ResourceEvaluationID or a Re-
              sourceID and ResourceType .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command returns the evaluation results for each rule with
       which the EC2 instance i-1a2b3c4d does not comply:

          aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-resource --resource-type AWS::EC2::Instance --resource-id i-1a2b3c4d --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

OUTPUT
       EvaluationResults -> (list)

          plies each Config rule.

          (structure)
              The details of an Config evaluation.  Provides  the  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource that was evaluated, the compliance of the re-
              source, related time stamps, and supplementary information.

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies the evaluation result.

                 EvaluationResultQualifier -> (structure)
                     Identifies an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon  Web
                     Services  resource,  and  provides the type and ID of the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services resource that was

                        tive or Proactive.

                 OrderingTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     The  time  of  the event that triggered the evaluation of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration  snapshot,  depending on which event triggered

                 vices resource.

              Annotation -> (string)
                 Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined
                 the compliance.

              ResultToken -> (string)
                 An encrypted token that associates an evaluation with an Con-
                 fig  rule. The token identifies the rule, the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices resource being evaluated, and the event that  triggered
                 the evaluation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
