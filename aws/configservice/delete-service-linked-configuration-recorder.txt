DELETE-SERVICE-LINKED-CONFIGURATDELETE-SERVICE-LINKED-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER()



NAME
       delete-service-linked-configuration-recorder -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an existing service-linked configuration recorder.

       This  operation  does not delete the configuration information that was
       previously recorded. You will be able to access the previously recorded
       information  by  using  the GetResourceConfigHistory operation, but you
       will not be able to access this information in the Config console until
       you  have  created  a new service-linked configuration recorder for the
       same service.

       NOTE:
              The recording scope  determines  if  you  receive  configuration
              items

          The recording scope is set by the service that is linked to the con-
          figuration recorder and determines whether you receive configuration
          items  (CIs)  in the delivery channel. If the recording scope is in-
          ternal, you will not receive CIs in the delivery channel.

OPTIONS
       --service-principal (string)
          The service principal of the Amazon Web  Services  service  for  the
          service-linked configuration recorder that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.
