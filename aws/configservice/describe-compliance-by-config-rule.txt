NAME
       describe-compliance-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Indicates  whether  the specified Config rules are compliant. If a rule
       is noncompliant, this action returns the number of Amazon Web  Services
       resources that do not comply with the rule.

       A  rule  is compliant if all of the evaluated resources comply with it.
       It is noncompliant if any of these resources do not comply.

       If Config has no current evaluation results for the  rule,  it  returns
       INSUFFICIENT_DATA  .  This  result  might indicate one of the following
       conditions:

       o Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether
         it  has, use the DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus action to get the
         LastSuccessfulInvocationTime and LastFailedInvocationTime .

       o The rule's Lambda function is failing to send evaluation  results  to
         Config.  Verify  that  the  role  you  assigned to your configuration
         recorder includes the config:PutEvaluations permission. If  the  rule
         is  a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution role includes the
         config:PutEvaluations permission.

       o The rule's Lambda function has returned NOT_APPLICABLE for all evalu-
         ation  results.  This  can occur if the resources were deleted or re-
         moved from the rule's scope.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-compliance-by-config-rule is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ComplianceByConfigRules

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          Specify one or more Config rule names to filter the results by rule.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get compliance information for your AWS Config rules

       The following command returns compliance information for each AWS  Con-
       fig rule that is violated by one or more AWS resources:

          aws configservice describe-compliance-by-config-rule --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

       In  the  output, the value for each CappedCount attribute indicates how
       many resources do not comply with the related rule.  For  example,  the
       following output indicates that 3 resources do not comply with the rule
       named InstanceTypesAreT2micro.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceByConfigRules": [
                  {
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 3,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      },
                      "ConfigRuleName": "InstanceTypesAreT2micro"
                  },
                  {
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 10,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      },
                      "ConfigRuleName": "RequiredTagsForVolumes"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ComplianceByConfigRules -> (list)
          Indicates whether each of the specified Config rules is compliant.

          (structure)
              Indicates whether an Config rule is compliant. A rule is compli-
              ant  if all of the resources that the rule evaluated comply with
              it. A rule is noncompliant if any of these resources do not com-
              ply.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 Indicates whether the Config rule is compliant.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Con-
                     fig rule is compliant.

                     A resource is compliant if it complies with  all  of  the
                     Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant
                     if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

                     A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule
                     evaluates  comply  with it. A rule is noncompliant if any
                     of these resources do not comply.

                     Config returns the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value when no evalu-
                     ation  results  are available for the Amazon Web Services
                     resource or Config rule.

                     For the Compliance data type, Config supports  only  COM-
                     PLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  , and INSUFFICIENT_DATA values.
                     Config does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE value for  the
                     Compliance data type.

                 ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)
                     The  number  of  Amazon  Web Services resources or Config
                     rules that cause a result of NON_COMPLIANT , up to a max-
                     imum number.

                     CappedCount -> (integer)
                        The  number of Amazon Web Services resources or Config
                        rules responsible for the current  compliance  of  the
                        item.

                     CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
