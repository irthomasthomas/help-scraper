GET-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCGET-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACK-DETAILED-STATUS()



NAME
       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed status for each member account within an organization
       for a given organization conformance pack.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status is a paginated opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: OrganizationCon-
       formancePackDetailedStatuses

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-name (string)
          The name of organization conformance pack for which you want  status
          details for member accounts.

       --filters (structure)
          An OrganizationResourceDetailedStatusFilters object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit account ID of the member account within an organi-
              zation.

          Status -> (string)
              Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member ac-
              count.  When  management account calls PutOrganizationConforman-
              cePack action for the first time,  conformance  pack  status  is
              created  in  the  member  account. When management account calls
              PutOrganizationConformancePack action for the second time,  con-
              formance  pack  status is updated in the member account. Confor-
              mance pack status is deleted when the management account deletes
              OrganizationConformancePack and disables service access for con-
              fig-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

              Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

              o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  created  in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being created in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_FAILED when conformance pack creation has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is being  deleted  in
                the member account.

              o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL  when  conformance  pack has been deleted in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  updated  in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being updated in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "Status": "CREATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"CREATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_SUCCESSFUL"|"DELETE_FAILED"|"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConformancePackDetailedStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Organization conformance pack creation  or  deletion  status  in
              each  member  account. This includes the name of the conformance
              pack, the status, error code and error message when the  confor-
              mance pack creation or deletion failed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit account ID of a member account.

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name of conformance pack deployed in the member account.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates  deployment status for conformance pack in a member
                 account. When management account calls PutOrganizationConfor-
                 mancePack  action for the first time, conformance pack status
                 is created in the member  account.  When  management  account
                 calls  PutOrganizationConformancePack  action  for the second
                 time, conformance pack status is updated in  the  member  ac-
                 count. Conformance pack status is deleted when the management
                 account deletes OrganizationConformancePack and disables ser-
                 vice access for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been created in
                   the member account.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is  being  created
                   in the member account.

                   the member account.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being deleted
                   in the member account.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been deleted in
                   the member account.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been updated in
                   the member account.
