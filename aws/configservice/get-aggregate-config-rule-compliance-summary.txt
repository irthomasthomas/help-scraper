OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters  the results based on the ConfigRuleComplianceSummaryFilters
          object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

          AwsRegion -> (string)
              The source region where the data is aggregated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "AwsRegion": "string"
          }

       --group-by-key (string)
          Groups the result based on ACCOUNT_ID or AWS_REGION.

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT_ID

          o AWS_REGION

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page.  The
          default  is  1000. You cannot specify a number greater than 1000. If
          you specify 0, Config uses the default.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
