OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          A  list of Config rule names of remediation configurations for which
          you want details.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RemediationConfigurations -> (list)
          Returns a remediation configuration object.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details about the remediation con-
              figuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and
              data to execute the action.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              TargetType -> (string)
                 The  type of the target. Target executes remediation. For ex-
                 ample, SSM document.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 Target ID is the name of the SSM document.

                 ment.

                 NOTE:
                     If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM doc-
                     ument,  you  must  call  PutRemediationConfiguration  API
                     again to ensure the remediations can run.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 An object of the RemediationParameterValue.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The  value  is  either  a  dynamic  (resource) value or a
                     static value. You must select either a dynamic value or a
                     static value.

                     ResourceValue -> (structure)
                        The value is dynamic and changes at run-time.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value is a resource ID.

                     StaticValue -> (structure)
                        The value is static and does not change at run-time.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A  list of values. For example, the ARN of the as-
                            sumed role.

                            (string)

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              Automatic -> (boolean)
                 The remediation is triggered automatically.

              ExecutionControls -> (structure)
                 An ExecutionControls object.

                 SsmControls -> (structure)
                     A SsmControls object.

                     ConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage -> (integer)
                        The maximum percentage of remediation actions  allowed
                        to  run in parallel on the non-compliant resources for
                        that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such
                        as 10%. The default value is 10.

                     ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                        The  percentage  of errors that are allowed before SSM
                        stops running automations on  non-compliant  resources
                        for  that  specific rule. You can specify a percentage
                        of errors, for example 10%. If you do not  specifiy  a
                        percentage,  the  default  is 50%. For example, if you
                        set the ErrorPercentage to 40%  for  10  non-compliant
                        resources, then SSM stops running the automations when
                        the fifth error is received.

              MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of failed attempts  for  auto-remediation.
                 If you do not select a number, the default is 5.

                 For  example,  if  you  specify MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5
                 with RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds, Config will put a Re-
                 mediationException  on  your  behalf for the failing resource
                 after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.

              RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                 Time window to determine whether or not to add a  remediation
                 exception  to prevent infinite remediation attempts. If Maxi-
                 mumAutomaticAttempts remediation attempts have been made  un-
                 der  RetryAttemptSeconds  ,  a  remediation exception will be
                 added to the resource. If you do not select a number, the de-
                 fault is 60 seconds.

                 For example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds
                 and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will run auto-reme-
                 diations  5  times within 50 seconds before adding a remedia-
                 tion exception to the resource.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.

              CreatedByService -> (string)
                 Name of the service that owns the service-linked rule, if ap-
                 plicable.
