PUT-SERVICE-LINKED-CONFIGURATION-REPUT-SERVICE-LINKED-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER()



NAME
       put-service-linked-configuration-recorder -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  service-linked  configuration  recorder that is linked to a
       specific Amazon Web Services service based on the ServicePrincipal  you
       specify.

       The  configuration  recorder's  name , recordingGroup , recordingMode ,
       and recordingScope is set by the service that is linked to the configu-
       ration recorder.

       For  more  information,  see  ` Working with the Configuration Recorder
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html`__
       in the Config Developer Guide .

       This  API creates a service-linked role AWSServiceRoleForConfig in your
       account. The service-linked role is created only when the role does not
       exist in your account.

       NOTE:
              The  recording  scope  determines  if  you receive configuration
              items

          The recording scope is set by the service that is linked to the con-
          figuration recorder and determines whether you receive configuration
          items (CIs) in the delivery channel. If the recording scope  is  in-
          ternal, you will not receive CIs in the delivery channel.
              Tags are added at creation and cannot be updated with this oper-
              ation

          Use TagResource and UntagResource to update tags after creation.

OPTIONS
       --service-principal (string)
          The service principal of the Amazon Web  Services  service  for  the
          service-linked configuration recorder that you want to create.

       --tags (list)
          The  tags for a service-linked configuration recorder. Each tag con-
          sists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

          (structure)
              The tags for the resource. The metadata that you apply to a  re-
              source  to  help you categorize and organize them. Each tag con-
              sists of a key and an optional value, both of which you  define.
              Tag  keys can have a maximum character length of 128 characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a  tag.  A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  specified configuration
          recorder.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the specified configuration recorder.

          For service-linked configuration recorders, Config automatically as-
          signs  a  name  that has the prefix "AWS " to the new service-linked
          configuration recorder.
