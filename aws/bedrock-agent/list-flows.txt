LIST-FLOWS()                                                      LIST-FLOWS()



NAME
       list-flows -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of flows and information about each flow. For more in-
       formation, see Manage a flow in Amazon Bedrock in  the  Amazon  Bedrock
       User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-flows  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: flowSummaries

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       flowSummaries -> (list)
          A list, each member of which contains information about a flow.

          (structure)
              Contains the definition of a flow.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the flow.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the flow was created.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the flow.

              id -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the flow.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the flow.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the flow. The following statuses are possible:

                 o NotPrepared   The  flow  has  been  created or updated, but
                   hasn't been prepared. If you just  created  the  flow,  you
                   can't  test  it. If you updated the flow, the DRAFT version
                   won't contain  the  latest  changes  for  testing.  Send  a
                   PrepareFlow  request to package the latest changes into the
                   DRAFT version.

                 o Preparing  The flow is being prepared  so  that  the  DRAFT
                   version contains the latest changes for testing.

                 o Prepared   The  flow is prepared and the DRAFT version con-
                   tains the latest changes for testing.

                 o Failed  The last API operation that you invoked on the flow
                   failed.  Send a GetFlow request and check the error message
                   in the validations field.

              updatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the flow was last updated.

              version -> (string)
                 The latest version of the flow.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If the total number of results is greater than the maxResults  value
          provided  in the request, use this token when making another request
          in the nextToken field to return the next batch of results.
