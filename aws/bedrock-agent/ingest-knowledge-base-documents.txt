NAME
       ingest-knowledge-base-documents -

DESCRIPTION
       Ingests documents directly into the knowledge base that is connected to
       the data source. The dataSourceType specified in the content  for  each
       document must match the type of the data source that you specify in the
       header. For more information, see Ingest  documents  into  a  knowledge
       base in real-time in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the API request
          completes no more than one time. If this token  matches  a  previous
          request,  Amazon Bedrock ignores the request, but does not return an
          error. For more information, see Ensuring idempotency .

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the knowledge base to ingest the  documents
          into.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
