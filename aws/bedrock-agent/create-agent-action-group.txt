CREATE-AGENT-ACTION-GROUP()                        CREATE-AGENT-ACTION-GROUP()



NAME
       create-agent-action-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  action  group for an agent. An action group represents the
       actions that an agent can carry out for the customer  by  defining  the
       APIs that an agent can call and the logic for calling them.

       To allow your agent to request the user for additional information when
       trying to complete a task, add an action group with  the  parentAction-
       GroupSignature  field  set to AMAZON.UserInput . You must leave the de-
       scription , apiSchema , and actionGroupExecutor fields blank  for  this
       action  group.  During  orchestration, if your agent determines that it
       needs to invoke an API in an action group, but doesn't have enough  in-
       formation to complete the API request, it will invoke this action group
       instead and return an Observation reprompting the user for more  infor-
       mation.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the  API  request
          completes  no  more  than one time. If this token matches a previous

          During orchestration, if your agent determines that it needs to  in-
          voke  an API in an action group, but doesn't have enough information
          to complete the API request, it will invoke this  action  group  in-
          stead and return an Observation reprompting the user for more infor-
          mation.

          Possible values:

          o AMAZON.UserInput

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
