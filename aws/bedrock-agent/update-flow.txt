                        sends  each item of the array as an output to the fol-
                        lowing node. The size of the array is also returned in
                        the output.

                        will return a response for each member of  the  array.
                        To return only one response, you can include a collec-
                        tor node downstream from the iterator node.

                            field  if you want to return the retrieved results
                            as an array.

                        as  the  output. You can use a prompt from Prompt man-
                        agement or you can configure one in this node.

                        sourceConfiguration -> (tagged union structure)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                            name of a condition and an expression that defines
                            the condition.

                            (structure)

                        will return a response for each member of  the  array.
