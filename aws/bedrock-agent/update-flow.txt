NAME
       update-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  flow. Include both fields that you want to keep and fields
       that you want to change. For more information, see  How  it  works  and
       Create a flow in Amazon Bedrock in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       update-flow  uses  document type values. Document types follow the JSON
       data model where valid values are: strings,  numbers,  booleans,  null,
       arrays,  and  objects. For command input, options and nested parameters
       that are labeled with the type  document  must  be  provided  as  JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

                        lowing node. The size of the array is also returned in
                        the output.

                        will return a response for each member of  the  array.
                        To return only one response, you can include a collec-

       --description (string)
          A description for the flow.

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service role with permissions
          to create and manage a flow. For more information, see Create a ser-
          vice  role  for  flows  in Amazon Bedrock in the Amazon Bedrock User
          Guide.

       --flow-identifier (string)
          The unique identifier of the flow.

       --name (string)
          A name for the flow.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
