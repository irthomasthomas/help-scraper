          --agent-id <value>
          --agent-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the agent.

       --agent-version (string)
          The version of the agent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 tions must contain a parserMode value that is set to OVERRID-
                 DEN . For more information, see  Parser  Lambda  function  in
                 Agents for Amazon Bedrock .

              promptConfigurations -> (list)
                 Contains  configurations to override a prompt template in one
                 part of an agent sequence. For more information, see Advanced
                 prompts .

                     basePromptTemplate -> (string)
                        Defines  the prompt template with which to replace the
                        default prompt template. You can use placeholder vari-
                        ables  in  the  base  prompt template to customize the
                        prompt. For  more  information,  see  Prompt  template
                        placeholder  variables  .  For  more  information, see
                        Configure the prompt templates .

                     inferenceConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Contains inference parameters to use  when  the  agent
                        invokes  a  foundation  model in the part of the agent
                        sequence defined by the promptType . For more informa-
                        tion, see Inference parameters for foundation models .

                        maximumLength -> (integer)
                            The  maximum number of tokens to allow in the gen-
                            erated response.

                        stopSequences -> (list)
                            A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a se-
                            quence of characters that causes the model to stop
                            generating the response.

                            (string)

                        temperature -> (float)
                            The likelihood of the model selecting higher-prob-
                            ability  options  while  generating  a response. A
                            lower value makes the model more likely to  choose
                            higher-probability  options,  while a higher value
                            makes the model more likely to choose lower-proba-
                            bility options.

                        topK -> (integer)
                            While  generating a response, the model determines
                            the probability of the  following  token  at  each
                            point  of  generation.  The value that you set for
                            topK is the number of most-likely candidates  from
                            which  the model chooses the next token in the se-
                            quence. For example, if you set topK  to  50,  the
                            model selects the next token from among the top 50
                            most likely choices.

                        topP -> (float)
                            While generating a response, the model  determines
                            the  probability  of  the  following token at each
                            point of generation. The value that  you  set  for
                            Top  P determines the number of most-likely candi-
                            dates from which the model chooses the next  token
                            in  the  sequence. For example, if you set topP to
                            80, the model only selects the next token from the
                            top  80%  of  the probability distribution of next
                            tokens.

                     parserMode -> (string)
                        Specifies  whether  to  override  the  default  parser
                        Lambda  function when parsing the raw foundation model
                        output in the part of the agent  sequence  defined  by
                        the  promptType  . If you set the field as OVERRIDEN ,
                        the      overrideLambda       field       in       the
                        PromptOverrideConfiguration must be specified with the
                        ARN of a Lambda function.

                     promptCreationMode -> (string)
                        Specifies whether to override the default prompt  tem-
                        plate for this promptType . Set this value to OVERRID-
                        DEN to use the prompt that you provide  in  the  base-
                        PromptTemplate  .  If  you  leave  it as DEFAULT , the
                        agent uses a default prompt template.

                     promptState -> (string)
                        Specifies whether to allow the agent to carry out  the
                        step  specified  in  the  promptType . If you set this
                        value to DISABLED , the agent skips that step. The de-
                        fault state for each promptType is as follows.

                        o PRE_PROCESSING  ENABLED

                        o ORCHESTRATION  ENABLED

                        o KNOWLEDGE_BASE_RESPONSE_GENERATION  ENABLED

                        o POST_PROCESSING  DISABLED

                     promptType -> (string)
                        The  step  in the agent sequence that this prompt con-
                        figuration applies to.

          recommendedActions -> (list)
              A list of recommended actions to take for the failed API  opera-
              tion on the version to succeed.

              (string)

          updatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the version was last updated.

          version -> (string)
              The version number.
