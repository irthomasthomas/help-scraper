          ments.

       --document-identifiers (list)
          A list of objects, each of which contains information to identify  a
          document for which to retrieve information.

              custom -> (structure)
                 Contains information that identifies the document in a custom
                 data source.

                 id -> (string)
                     The identifier of the document to ingest  into  a  custom
                     data source.

              dataSourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of data source connected to the knowledge base that
                 contains the document.

              s3 -> (structure)
                 Contains information that identifies the document  in  an  S3
                 data source.

                 uri -> (string)
                     The        location's       URI.       For       example,

       Shorthand Syntax:

          custom={id=string},dataSourceType=string,s3={uri=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "custom": {
                "id": "string"
              },
              "dataSourceType": "CUSTOM"|"S3",
              "s3": {
                "uri": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the knowledge base that is connected to the
          data source.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
