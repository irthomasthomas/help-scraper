LIST-INGESTION-JOBS()                                    LIST-INGESTION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-ingestion-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  ingestion jobs for a data source and information about each
       of them.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-ingestion-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ingestionJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the data source for which to return inges-
          tion jobs.

       --filters (list)
          Contains a definition of a filter for which to filter the results.

          (structure)
              Defines a filter by which to filter the results.

              attribute -> (string)
                 The attribute by which to filter the results.

              operator -> (string)
                 The operation to carry out between the attribute and the val-
                 ues.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values for the attribute.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attribute": "STATUS",
              "operator": "EQ",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the knowledge base for which to return in-
          gestion jobs.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Contains details about how to sort the results.

          attribute -> (string)
              The attribute by which to sort the results.

          order -> (string)
              The order by which to sort the results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "STATUS"|"STARTED_AT",
            "order": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       seconds.
