LIST-INGESTION-JOBS()                                    LIST-INGESTION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-ingestion-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the data ingestion jobs for a data source. The list also includes
       information about each job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-ingestion-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ingestionJobSummaries

OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the data source for the list of data inges-
          tion jobs.

       --filters (list)
          Contains information about the filters for filtering the data.

          (structure)
              The definition of a filter to filter the data.

              attribute -> (string)
                 The name of field or attribute to apply the filter.

              operator -> (string)
                 The operation to apply to the field or attribute.

              values -> (list)
                 A list of values that belong to the field or attribute.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "attribute": "STATUS",
              "operator": "EQ",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the knowledge base for the list of data in-
          gestion jobs.

       --sort-by (structure)
          Contains details about how to sort the data.

          attribute -> (string)
              The name of field or attribute to apply sorting of data.

          order -> (string)
              The order for sorting the data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attribute=string,order=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attribute": "STATUS"|"STARTED_AT",
            "order": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
