OPTIONS
       --action-group-id (string)
          The  unique identifier of the action group for which to get informa-
          tion.

       --agent-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the agent that the action group belongs to.

       --agent-version (string)
          The version of the agent that the action group belongs to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This

              payload -> (string)
                 The  JSON  or  YAML-formatted  payload  defining  the OpenAPI
                 schema for the action group. For more information, see Action

          clientToken -> (string)
              A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the API re-
              quest completes no more than one time. If this token  matches  a
              previous  request,  Amazon Bedrock ignores the request, but does
              not return an error. For more information, see Ensuring  idempo-
              tency .

          parentActionSignature -> (string)
              If this field is set as AMAZON.UserInput , the agent can request
              the user for additional information when trying  to  complete  a

              fields must be blank for this action group.

              During orchestration, if the agent determines that it  needs  to
              invoke an API in an action group, but doesn't have enough infor-
              mation to complete the API request, it will invoke  this  action
              group instead and return an Observation reprompting the user for
              more information.

          updatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the action group was last updated.
