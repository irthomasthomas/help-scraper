OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the data source.

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the knowledge base that the data source was
          added to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     Knowledge  base can split your source data into chunks. A
                     chunk refers to an excerpt from a data source that is re-
                     turned  when  the  knowledge  base  that it belongs to is
                     queried. You have the following options for chunking your
                     data.  If  you  opt  for  NONE  ,  then  you  may want to
                     pre-process your files by splitting  them  up  such  that
                     each file corresponds to a chunk.

                       chunks of the approximate size  that  you  set  in  the
                       fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration .

                     o HIERARCHICAL   Split  documents  into  layers of chunks
                       where the first layer contains large  chunks,  and  the
                       second  layer  contains smaller chunks derived from the
                       first layer.

                     o SEMANTIC  Split documents into chunks based  on  groups
                       of  similar  content derived with natural language pro-
                       cessing.

                     o NONE  Amazon Bedrock treats each file as one chunk.  If
                       you  choose  this  option,  you may want to pre-process
                       your documents by splitting them into separate files.

                 fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration -> (structure)

                     ers  of  chunks  where  the  first  layer  contains large
                     chunks, and the second layer contains smaller chunks  de-
