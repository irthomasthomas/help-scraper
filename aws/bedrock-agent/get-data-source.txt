OPTIONS
       --data-source-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the data source.

       --knowledge-base-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the knowledge base that the data source was
          added to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

              chunkingConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Details  about how to chunk the documents in the data source.
                 A chunk refers to an excerpt from a data source that  is  re-
                 turned when the knowledge base that it belongs to is queried.

                 chunkingStrategy -> (string)
                     Knowledge  base can split your source data into chunks. A
                     chunk refers to an excerpt from a data source that is re-
                     turned  when  the  knowledge  base  that it belongs to is
                     queried. You have the following options for chunking your
                     data.  If  you  opt  for  NONE  ,  then  you  may want to
                     pre-process your files by splitting  them  up  such  that
                     each file corresponds to a chunk.

                     o FIXED_SIZE  Amazon Bedrock splits your source data into
                       chunks of the approximate size  that  you  set  in  the
                       fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration .

                     o NONE   Amazon Bedrock treats each file as one chunk. If
                       you choose this option, you  may  want  to  pre-process
                       your documents by splitting them into separate files.

                 fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configurations  for  when you choose fixed-size chunking.
                     If you set the chunkingStrategy as NONE  ,  exclude  this
                     field.

                     maxTokens -> (integer)
                        The maximum number of tokens to include in a chunk.

                     overlapPercentage -> (integer)
                        The percentage of overlap between adjacent chunks of a
                        data source.
