FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                            FAILOVER-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       failover-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Promotes  the specified secondary DB cluster to be the primary DB clus-
       ter in the global cluster when failing over a global cluster occurs.

       Use this operation to respond to an unplanned event, such as a regional
       disaster  in  the  primary region. Failing over can result in a loss of
       write transaction data that wasn't replicated to the  chosen  secondary
       before  the failover event occurred. However, the recovery process that
       promotes a DB instance on the chosen seconday DB cluster to be the pri-
       mary  writer  DB instance guarantees that the data is in a transaction-
       ally consistent state.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the Amazon DocumentDB global cluster to apply this
          operation.  The  identifier  is  the unique key assigned by the user
          when the cluster is created. In other words, it's the  name  of  the
          global cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global cluster.

          o Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

          Pattern: [A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z-:._]*

       --target-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of the secondary Amazon DocumentDB cluster that you
          want to promote to the primary for the global cluster. Use the  Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN) for the identifier so that Amazon DocumentDB
          can locate the cluster in its Amazon Web Services region.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing secondary cluster.

          o Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 255.

          Pattern: [A-Za-z][0-9A-Za-z-:._]*

       --allow-data-loss | --no-allow-data-loss (boolean)
          Specifies whether to allow data loss for this global cluster  opera-
          tion. Allowing data loss triggers a global failover operation.

          If  you  don't  specify AllowDataLoss , the global cluster operation
          defaults to a switchover.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified together with the Switchover parameter.

       --switchover | --no-switchover (boolean)
          Specifies whether to switch over this global database cluster.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be specified together with the AllowDataLoss parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
