CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon DocumentDB global cluster that can span multiple mul-
       tiple Amazon Web Services Regions. The global cluster contains one pri-
       mary  cluster with read-write capability, and up-to give read-only sec-
       ondary clusters. Global clusters uses  storage-based  fast  replication
       across regions with latencies less than one second, using dedicated in-
       frastructure with no impact to your workloads performance.

       You can create a global cluster that is initially empty, and then add a
       primary  and  a secondary to it. Or you can specify an existing cluster
       during the create operation, and this cluster becomes  the  primary  of
       the global cluster.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Amazon DocumentDB clusters.

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global cluster.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use as the primary cluster of the
          global cluster. This parameter is optional.

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used for this cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version of the global cluster.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The deletion protection setting for  the  new  global  cluster.  The
          global cluster can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name for your database of up to 64 alpha-numeric characters. If
          you do not provide a name, Amazon DocumentDB will not create a data-
          base in the global cluster you are creating.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          The storage encryption setting for the new global cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
