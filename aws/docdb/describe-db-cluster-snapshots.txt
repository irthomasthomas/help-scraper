NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  cluster snapshots. This API operation sup-
       ports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The ID of the cluster to retrieve the list of cluster snapshots for.
          This parameter can't be used  with  the  DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
          parameter. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If provided, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster .

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A  specific  cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This parameter
          can't be used with the DBClusterIdentifier parameter. This value  is
          stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If  provided,  must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster-
            Snapshot .

          o If this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the  SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of
          the following values:

          o automated - Return all cluster snapshots  that  Amazon  DocumentDB
            has automatically created for your Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual  - Return all cluster snapshots that you have manually cre-
            ated for your Amazon Web Services account.

          o shared - Return all manual cluster snapshots that have been shared
            to your Amazon Web Services account.

          o public  -  Return  all  cluster snapshots that have been marked as
            public.

          If you don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both  automated  and
          manual  cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared clus-
          ter snapshots with these results by setting the IncludeShared param-
          eter  to  true . You can include public cluster snapshots with these
          results by setting the``IncludePublic`` parameter to true .

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  named  set  of  filter values, used to return a more specific
              list of results. You can use a filter to  match  a  set  of  re-
              sources by specific criteria, such as IDs.

              Wildcards are not supported in filters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to include shared manual cluster snapshots from other
          Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web  Services  account
          has  been given permission to copy or restore, and otherwise false .
          The default is false .

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          Set to true to include manual cluster snapshots that are public  and
          can  be  copied  or restored by any Amazon Web Services account, and
          otherwise false . The default is false .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
