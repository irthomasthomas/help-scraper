OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resource  that  the  pending
          maintenance action applies to.

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type  of opt-in request or undoes an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance opt-in re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To have pending maintenance actions take place during the next  mainte-
       nance window

       The  following apply-pending-maintenance-action example causes all sys-
       tem-update actions to be performed during the  next  scheduled  mainte-
       nance window.

          aws docdb apply-pending-maintenance-action \
          --resource-identifier arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:sample-cluster \
          --apply-action system-update \
          --opt-in-type next-maintenance

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see  Applying Amazon DocumentDB Updates in the
       Amazon DocumentDB Developer Guide.

              tions for the resource.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about a pending maintenance action for a

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date of the maintenance window when the action is ap-
                     plied.  The maintenance action is applied to the resource
                     during its first maintenance window after this  date.  If

                     The date when the maintenance action is automatically ap-
                     plied.  The maintenance action is applied to the resource
                     on this date regardless of the maintenance window for the
                     resource. If this date is specified, any immediate opt-in

                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is
                     applied to the resource.
