OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The    identifier    of    the    cluster   to   restart.   Example:
          docdb-2019-05-28-15-24-52

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2 Availability Zones that in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon  DocumentDB  distrib-
              utes  the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB repli-
              cas in the cluster. This functionality  can  help  balance  your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

                     a failure of the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of virtual private cloud (VPC)  security  groups
              that the cluster belongs to.

              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
