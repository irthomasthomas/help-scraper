            }
            ...
          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the cluster is encrypted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key identifier for an encrypted cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same  Amazon
          Web  Services  account that owns the KMS encryption key that is used
          to encrypt the new cluster, you can use the KMS key alias instead of
          the ARN for the KMS encryption key.

          If an encryption key is not specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If the StorageEncrypted parameter is true , Amazon DocumentDB uses
            your default encryption key.

          KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web  Services
          account.  Your  Amazon  Web Services account has a different default
          encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Regions.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          Not currently supported.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          A list of log types that need to be enabled for exporting to  Amazon
          CloudWatch  Logs.  You  can  enable audit logs or profiler logs. For
          more  information,  see  Auditing  Amazon  DocumentDB   Events   and
          Profiling Amazon DocumentDB Operations .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Specifies whether this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionProtection
          is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless it is modified  and
          DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection protects clusters
          from being accidentally deleted.

       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global cluster.

       --storage-type (string)
          The storage type to associate with the DB cluster.

          For information on storage types for Amazon DocumentDB clusters, see
          Cluster  storage  configurations  in the Amazon DocumentDB Developer
          Guide .

          Valid values for storage type - standard | iopt1

          Default value is standard

          NOTE:
              When you create a DocumentDB DB cluster with  the  storage  type
              set to iopt1 , the storage type is returned in the response. The
              storage type isn't returned when you set it to standard .

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Detailed information about a cluster.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of  Amazon  EC2 Availability Zones that in-
              stances in the cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which automatic  snapshots  are
              retained.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied cluster identifier. This identifier is
              the unique key that identifies a cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the cluster parameter group for the  clus-
              ter.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  information  on  the  subnet group that is associated
              with the cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets
              in the subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader  endpoint for the cluster. The reader endpoint for a
              cluster load balances connections across the  Amazon  DocumentDB
              replicas that are available in a cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Amazon  DocumentDB  distrib-
              utes  the connection requests among the Amazon DocumentDB repli-
              cas in the cluster. This functionality  can  help  balance  your
              read workload across multiple Amazon DocumentDB replicas in your
              cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Amazon DocumentDB replica that you
              are  connected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your
              connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to
              other  Amazon  DocumentDB  replicas in the cluster, you can then
              reconnect to the reader endpoint.

              Contains the master user name for the cluster.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the  daily  time range during which automated backups
              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          ReplicationSourceIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains the identifier of the source cluster if this cluster is
              a secondary cluster.

              crypted cluster.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier  for
              the  cluster. This identifier is found in CloudTrail log entries

              Provides a list of the  Identity  and  Access  Management  (IAM)
              roles that are associated with the cluster. (IAM) roles that are
              associated with a cluster grant permission for  the  cluster  to
              access other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes  an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that
                 is associated with a cluster.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAMrole that is as-

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes  the  state  of association between the IAMrole
                     and the cluster. The Status property returns one  of  the
                     following values:

                     o ACTIVE - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the cluster
                       and can be used to access  other  Amazon  Web  Services
                       services on your behalf.

                     o PENDING  - The IAMrole ARN is being associated with the
                       cluster.

                     o INVALID - The IAMrole ARN is associated with the  clus-
                       ter,  but  the cluster cannot assume the IAMrole to ac-
                       cess other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf.

              (string)

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  this cluster can be deleted. If DeletionPro-
              tection is enabled, the cluster cannot be deleted unless  it  is
              modified  and DeletionProtection is disabled. DeletionProtection
              protects clusters from being accidentally deleted.

          StorageType -> (string)
              Storage type associated with your cluster

              Storage type associated with your cluster
