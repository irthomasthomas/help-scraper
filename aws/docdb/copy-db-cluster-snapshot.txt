COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                          COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies a snapshot of a cluster.

       To  copy  a  cluster  snapshot  from  a shared manual cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN)  of  the  shared  cluster snapshot. You can only copy a shared DB
       cluster snapshot, whether encrypted or not, in the same Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region.

       To cancel the copy operation after it is in progress, delete the target
       cluster snapshot identified by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  while
       that cluster snapshot is in the copying status.

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is
          not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the available state.

          o If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web  Services  Region
            as the copy, specify a valid snapshot identifier.

          o If  the  source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Re-
            gion than the copy, specify a valid cluster snapshot ARN.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source
          cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is
          the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the  KMS  key
          alias for the KMS encryption key.

          If  you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to  encrypt  the
          copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for
          KmsKeyId , then the copy of the cluster snapshot is  encrypted  with
          the same KMS key as the source cluster snapshot.

          If  you  copy  an encrypted cluster snapshot that is shared from an-
          other Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for
          KmsKeyId .

          To copy an encrypted cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services
          Region, set KmsKeyId to the KMS key ID that you want to use  to  en-
          crypt  the  copy  of the cluster snapshot in the destination Region.
          KMS encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Web  Services  Region
          that they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one
          Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

          If you copy an unencrypted cluster snapshot and specify a value  for
          the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          The  URL  that  contains  a  Signature  Version 4 signed request for
          the``CopyDBClusterSnapshot`` API action in the Amazon  Web  Services
          Region  that  contains the source cluster snapshot to copy. You must
          use the PreSignedUrl parameter when copying a cluster snapshot  from
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

          If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
          specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  instead  of
          specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogener-
          ates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that
          can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnap-
          shot API action that can be executed in the source Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  Region  that  contains the cluster snapshot to be copied. The
          presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

          o SourceRegion - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot  to
            be copied.

          o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The identifier for the the en-
            crypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be  in
            the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
            Services Region. For example, if  you  are  copying  an  encrypted
            cluster  snapshot  from  the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region,
            then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks  something  like
            the    following:   arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-clus-
            ter:sample-cluster-snapshot .

          o TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The  identifier  for  the  new
            cluster  snapshot  to be created. This parameter isn't case sensi-
            tive.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          Set to true to copy all tags from the source cluster snapshot to the
          target  cluster snapshot, and otherwise false . The default is false
          .

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the cluster snapshot.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon DocumentDB resource consisting of
              a key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  required name of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be  prefixed
                 with  "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the set
                 of Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/',  '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a copy of a snapshot

       The  following  copy-db-cluster-snapshot  example  makes a copy of sam-
       ple-cluster-snapshot named sample-cluster-snapshot-copy. The  copy  has
       all  the tags of the original plus a new tag with the key name CopyNum-
       ber.

          aws docdb copy-db-cluster-snapshot \
              --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier sample-cluster-snapshot \
              --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier sample-cluster-snapshot-copy \
              --copy-tags \
              --tags Key="CopyNumber",Value="1"

       This command produces no output.
