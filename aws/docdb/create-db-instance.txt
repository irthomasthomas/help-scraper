OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)

          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --db-instance-class (string)

          db.r5.large .

       --engine (string)

          Valid value: docdb

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Amazon EC2 Availability Zone that the instance is created in.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's

                 to  128  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed
                 with "aws: " or "rds: ". The string can contain only the  set
                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value of the tag. The string value can be from 1
                 to  256  Unicode  characters  in length and can't be prefixed

                 of  Unicode letters, digits, white space, '_', '.', '/', '=',
                 '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the cluster that the instance will belong to.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy tags from the DB instance  to
          snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  order  in which an Amazon DocumentDB
          replica is promoted to the primary instance after a failure  of  the
          existing primary instance.

          Default: 1

          Valid values: 0-15

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable  Performance  Insights  for
          the  DB Instance. For more information, see Using Amazon Performance
          Insights .

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data.

          The KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN,  or  alias
          name for the KMS key.

          If  you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId, then
          Amazon DocumentDB uses your default KMS key. There is a default  KMS
          key  for  your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services
          account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services
          region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an Amazon DocumentDB cluster instance

       The following create-db-instance example code creates the instance sam-
       ple-cluster-instance-2 in the Amazon DocumentDB cluster sample-cluster.

          aws docdb create-db-instance \
              --db-cluster-identifier sample-cluster \
              --db-instance-class db.r4.xlarge \
              --db-instance-identifier sample-cluster-instance-2 \
