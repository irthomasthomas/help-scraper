NAME
       get-retained-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the details of a single retained message for the specified topic.

       This  action returns the message payload of the retained message, which
       can incur messaging costs. To list only the topic names of the retained
       messages, call ListRetainedMessages .

       Requires permission to access the GetRetainedMessage action.

       For more information about messaging costs, see Amazon Web Services IoT
       Core pricing - Messaging .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       NOTE:
          For production code it is strongly recommended  to  use  the  custom
          endpoint for your account (retrievable via the iot describe-endpoint
          command) to ensure best availability and reachability  of  the  ser-
          vice. The default endpoints (intended for testing purposes only) can
          be                             found                              at
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#iot-core-data-plane-endpoints

SYNOPSIS
            get-retained-message
          --topic <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --topic (string)
          The topic name of the retained message to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       topic -> (string)
          The topic name to which the retained message was published.

       payload -> (blob)
          The Base64-encoded message payload of the retained message body.

       qos -> (integer)
          The quality of service (QoS) level used to publish the retained mes-
          sage.

       lastModifiedTime -> (long)
          The Epoch date and time, in milliseconds, when the retained  message
          was stored by IoT.
