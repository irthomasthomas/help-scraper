       NOTE:
          For  production  code  it  is strongly recommended to use the custom

          command)  to  ensure  best availability and reachability of the ser-
          vice. The default endpoints (intended for testing purposes only) can
          be                              found                             at
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html#iot-core-data-plane-endpoints
