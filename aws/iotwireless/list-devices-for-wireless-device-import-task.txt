OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the import task for  which  wireless  devices  are
          listed.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this operation.

       --next-token (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       --status (string)
          The status of the devices in the import task.

          Possible values:

          o INITIALIZED

          o PENDING

          o ONBOARDED

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results.

       DestinationName -> (string)
          The name of the Sidewalk destination that describes the IoT rule  to
          route  messages received from devices in an import task that are on-
          boarded to AWS IoT Wireless.

       ImportedWirelessDeviceList -> (list)
          List of wireless devices in an import task and their onboarding sta-
          tus.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  wireless device that has been added to an
              import task.

              Sidewalk -> (structure)
                 The Sidewalk-related information about a device that has been
                 added to an import task.

                 SidewalkManufacturingSn -> (string)
                     The  Sidewalk  manufacturing  serial number (SMSN) of the
                     Sidewalk device.

                 OnboardingStatus -> (string)
                     The onboarding status of the Sidewalk device in  the  im-
                     port task.

                 OnboardingStatusReason -> (string)
                     The  reason for the onboarding status information for the
                     Sidewalk device.

                 LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the status  information  was  last  up-
                     dated.
