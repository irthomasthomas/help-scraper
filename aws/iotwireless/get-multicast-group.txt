OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the multicast group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          The description of the new resource.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the multicast group.

       LoRaWAN -> (structure)
          The  LoRaWAN  information that is to be returned from getting multi-
          cast group information.

          RfRegion -> (string)
              Supported RfRegions

          DlClass -> (string)
              DlClass for LoRaWAM, valid values are ClassB and ClassC.

          NumberOfDevicesRequested -> (integer)
              Number of devices that are requested to be associated  with  the
              multicast group.

          NumberOfDevicesInGroup -> (integer)
              Number of devices that are associated to the multicast group.

          ParticipatingGateways -> (structure)
              Specify  the list of gateways to which you want to send the mul-

              GatewayList -> (list)
                 The  list  of  gateways  that you want to use for sending the
                 multicast downlink. Each downlink will be  sent  to  all  the
                 gateways in the list with transmission interval between them.
                 If list is empty the gateway list  will  be  dynamically  se-
                 lected similar to the case of no ParticipatingGateways

                 (string)

              TransmissionInterval -> (integer)
                 The  duration of time for which AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN will
                 wait before transmitting the multicast payload  to  the  next
                 gateway in the list.

       CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
          Created at timestamp for the resource.
