LIST-POSITION-CONFIGURATIONS()                  LIST-POSITION-CONFIGURATIONS()



NAME
       list-position-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       List  position configurations for a given resource, such as positioning
       solvers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-position-configurations
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          Resource type for which position configurations are listed.

          Possible values:

          o WirelessDevice

          o WirelessGateway

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return in this operation.

       --next-token (string)
          To retrieve the next set of results, the nextToken value from a pre-
          vious response; otherwise null to receive the first set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       PositionConfigurationList -> (list)
          A list of position configurations.

          (structure)
              The wrapper for a position configuration.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 Resource identifier for the position configuration.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Resource type of the resource for the position configuration.

              Solvers -> (structure)
                 The details of the positioning solver object used to  compute
                 the location.

                 SemtechGnss -> (structure)
                     The Semtech GNSS solver object details.

                     Provider -> (string)
                        The vendor of the solver object.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of positioning solver used.

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status indicating whether the solver is enabled.

                     Fec -> (string)
                        Whether forward error correction is enabled.

              Destination -> (string)
                 The position data destination that describes the AWS IoT rule
                 that processes the device's position data for use by AWS  IoT
                 Core for LoRaWAN.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results.
