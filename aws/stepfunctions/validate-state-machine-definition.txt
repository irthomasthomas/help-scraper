NAME
       validate-state-machine-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates the syntax of a state machine definition.

       You  can  validate  that  a state machine definition is correct without
       creating a state machine resource. Step Functions will implicitly  per-
       form  the  same syntax check when you invoke CreateStateMachine and Up-
       dateStateMachine . State machine  definitions  are  specified  using  a
       JSON-based,  structured language. For more information on Amazon States
       Language see Amazon States Language (ASL).

       Suggested uses for ValidateStateMachineDefinition :

       o Integrate automated checks into your code review or Continuous  Inte-
         gration  (CI)  process  to  validate state machine definitions before
         starting deployments.

       o Run the validation from a Git pre-commit hook to check your state ma-
         chine definitions before committing them to your source repository.

       NOTE:
          Errors found in the state machine definition will be returned in the
          response as a list of diagnostic elements , rather than raise an ex-
          ception.

OPTIONS
       --definition (string)
          The Amazon States Language definition of the state machine. For more
          information, see Amazon States Language (ASL).

       --type (string)
          The target type of state machine for this definition. The default is
          STANDARD .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o EXPRESS

       --severity (string)
          Minimum level of diagnostics to return. ERROR returns only ERROR di-
          agnostics, whereas WARNING returns both WARNING and  ERROR  diagnos-
          tics. The default is ERROR .

          Possible values:

          o ERROR

          o WARNING

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of diagnostics that are returned per call. The
          default and maximum value is 100. Setting the value to 0  will  also
          use the default of 100.

          If the number of diagnostics returned in the response exceeds maxRe-
          sults , the value of the truncated field in the response will be set
          to true .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       result -> (string)
          The result value will be OK when no syntax errors are found, or FAIL
          if the workflow definition does not pass verification.

       diagnostics -> (list)
          If  the  result is OK , this field will be empty. When there are er-
          rors, this field will contain an array of Diagnostic objects to help
          you troubleshoot.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  error  found during validation. Validation errors
              found in the definition return in the response as diagnostic el-
              ements , rather than raise an exception.

              severity -> (string)
                 A  value  of  ERROR  means that you cannot create or update a
                 state machine with this definition.

              code -> (string)
                 Identifying code for the diagnostic.

              message -> (string)
                 Message describing the diagnostic condition.

              location -> (string)
                 Location of the issue in the state machine, if available.

                 For errors specific to a field, the location could be in  the
                 format:   /States/<StateName>/<FieldName>   ,   for  example:
                 /States/FailState/ErrorPath .

       truncated -> (boolean)
          The result value will be true if the number of diagnostics found  in
          the  workflow  definition  exceeds maxResults . When all diagnostics
          results are returned, the value will be false .
