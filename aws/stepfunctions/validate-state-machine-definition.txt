NAME
       validate-state-machine-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates  the syntax of a state machine definition specified in Amazon
       States Language (ASL), a JSON-based, structured language.

       You can validate that a state machine  definition  is  correct  without
       creating a state machine resource.

       Suggested uses for ValidateStateMachineDefinition :

       o Integrate  automated checks into your code review or Continuous Inte-
         gration (CI) process to check state machine definitions before start-
         ing deployments.

       o Run  validation  from  a Git pre-commit hook to verify the definition
         before committing to your source repository.

       Validation will look for problems in your state machine definition  and
       return a result and a list of diagnostic elements .

       The  result  value will be OK when your workflow definition can be suc-
       cessfully created or updated. Note the result can be OK even when diag-
       nostic  warnings  are present in the response. The result value will be
       FAIL when the workflow definition contains errors  that  would  prevent
       you from creating or updating your state machine.

       The  list of ValidateStateMachineDefinitionDiagnostic data elements can
       contain zero or more WARNING and/or ERROR elements.

       NOTE:
          The ValidateStateMachineDefinition API might add new diagnostics  in
          the  future, adjust diagnostic codes, or change the message wording.
          Your automated processes should only rely on the value of the result
          field  value  (OK,  FAIL). Do not rely on the exact order, count, or
          wording of diagnostic messages.

OPTIONS
       --definition (string)
          The Amazon States Language definition of the state machine. For more
          information, see Amazon States Language (ASL).

       --type (string)
          The target type of state machine for this definition. The default is
          STANDARD .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o EXPRESS

       --severity (string)
          Minimum level of diagnostics to return. ERROR returns only ERROR di-
          agnostics,  whereas  WARNING returns both WARNING and ERROR diagnos-
          tics. The default is ERROR .

          Possible values:

          o ERROR

          o WARNING

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of diagnostics that are returned  per  call.  The
          default  and  maximum value is 100. Setting the value to 0 will also
          use the default of 100.

          If the number of diagnostics returned in the response exceeds maxRe-
          sults , the value of the truncated field in the response will be set
          to true .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       result -> (string)
          The result value will be OK when no syntax errors are found, or FAIL
          if the workflow definition does not pass verification.

       diagnostics -> (list)
          An  array  of diagnostic errors and warnings found during validation
          of the state machine definition. Since warnings do not  prevent  de-
          ploying  your workflow definition, the result value could be OK even
          when warning diagnostics are present in the response.

          (structure)
              Describes potential issues found during  state  machine  valida-
              tion.  Rather  than raise an exception, validation will return a
              list of diagnostic elements containing diagnostic information.

              NOTE:
                     The ValidateStateMachineDefinitionlAPI might add new  di-
                     agnostics  in  the  future,  adjust  diagnostic codes, or
                     change the  message  wording.  Your  automated  processes
                     should  only  rely on the value of the result field value
                     (OK, FAIL). Do not rely on the  exact  order,  count,  or
                     wording of diagnostic messages.

                 List of warning codes
                     NO_DOLLAR

              No  .$  on  a  field  that appears to be a JSONPath or Intrinsic
              Function.
                 NO_PATH

              Field value looks like a path, but field name does not end  with
              'Path'.
                 PASS_RESULT_IS_STATIC

              Attempt to use a path in the result of a pass state.

              The state machine name has not been specified.
                 STATE_MACHINE_NAME_INVALID

              The state machine name does not follow the naming convention.
                 STATE_MACHINE_NAME_TOO_LONG

                 TOO_DEEPLY_NESTED

              The states are too deeply nested.

              severity -> (string)
                 A  value  of  ERROR  means that you cannot create or update a
                 state machine with this definition.
                     WARNING level diagnostics alert you to potential  issues,
                     but  they  will not prevent you from creating or updating
                     your state machine.

              code -> (string)
                 Identifying code for the diagnostic.

              message -> (string)
                 Message describing the diagnostic condition.

              location -> (string)
                 Location of the issue in the state machine, if available.

                 For errors specific to a field, the location could be in  the
                 format:   /States/<StateName>/<FieldName>   ,   for  example:
                 /States/FailState/ErrorPath .

       truncated -> (boolean)
          The result value will be true if the number of diagnostics found  in
          the  workflow  definition  exceeds maxResults . When all diagnostics
          results are returned, the value will be false .
