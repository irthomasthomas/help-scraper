DESCRIBE-STATE-MACHINE()                              DESCRIBE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       describe-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about a state machine's definition, its IAM role
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and configuration.

       A qualified state machine ARN can either refer  to  a  Distributed  Map
       state defined within a state machine, a version ARN, or an alias ARN.

       The  following are some examples of qualified and unqualified state ma-
       chine ARNs:

       o The following qualified state machine ARN refers to a Distributed Map
         state  with a label mapStateLabel in a state machine named myStateMa-
         chine   .    arn:partition:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:myS-
         tateMachine/mapStateLabel

       NOTE:
          If  you  provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to a Dis-
          tributed Map state , the request fails with ValidationException .

       o The following qualified state machine ARN refers to  an  alias  named
         PROD     .      arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<account-id>:stateMa-
         chine:<myStateMachine:PROD>

       NOTE:
          If you provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to  a  ver-
          sion ARN or an alias ARN, the request starts execution for that ver-
          sion or alias.

       o The following unqualified state machine ARN refers to a state machine
         named    myStateMachine    .     arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<ac-
         count-id>:stateMachine:<myStateMachine>

       This API action returns the details for a state machine version if  the
       stateMachineArn you specify is a state machine version ARN.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine  for  which  you
          want the information.

          If you specify a state machine version ARN, this API returns details
          about that version. The version ARN is a combination  of  state  ma-
          chine ARN and the version number separated by a colon (:). For exam-
          ple, stateMachineARN:1 .

       --included-data (string)
          If your state machine definition is encrypted with a KMS key,  call-
          ers  must have kms:Decrypt permission to decrypt the definition. Al-
          ternatively, you can call the API with includedData =  METADATA_ONLY
          to get a successful response without the encrypted definition.

          NOTE:
              When  calling a labelled ARN for an encrypted state machine, the
              includedData = METADATA_ONLY parameter will  not  apply  because
              Step Functions needs to decrypt the entire state machine defini-
              tion to get the Distributed Map states definition. In this case,
              the API caller needs to have kms:Decrypt permission.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_DATA

          o METADATA_ONLY

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the state machine.

          If you specified a state machine version ARN in  your  request,  the
          API  returns  the  version  ARN. The version ARN is a combination of
          state machine ARN and the version number separated by a  colon  (:).
          For example, stateMachineARN:1 .
