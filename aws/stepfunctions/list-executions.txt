LIST-EXECUTIONS()                                            LIST-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all executions of a state machine or a Map Run. You can list all
       executions related to a state machine by  specifying  a  state  machine
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or those related to a Map Run by specifying
       a Map Run ARN. Using this API action, you can also  list  all  redriven
       executions.

       You  can  also provide a state machine alias ARN or version ARN to list
       the executions associated with a specific alias or version.

       Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first.

       If nextToken is returned, there are more results available.  The  value
       of  nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call
       again using the returned token to retrieve  the  next  page.  Keep  all
       other  arguments  unchanged.  Each  pagination  token  expires after 24
       hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an  HTTP  400  In-
       validToken error.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: executions

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine whose executions
          is listed.

          You can specify either a mapRunArn or a stateMachineArn  ,  but  not
          both.

          You  can also return a list of executions associated with a specific
          alias or version , by specifying an alias ARN or a  version  ARN  in
          the stateMachineArn parameter.

       --status-filter (string)
          If  specified, only list the executions whose current execution sta-
          tus matches the given filter.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o ABORTED

          o PENDING_REDRIVE

       --map-run-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Map Run that started the child
          workflow  executions. If the mapRunArn field is specified, a list of
          all of the child workflow executions started by a  Map  Run  is  re-
          turned.  For  more  information,  see  Examining Map Run in the Step
          Functions Developer Guide .

          You can specify either a mapRunArn or a stateMachineArn  ,  but  not
          both.

       --redrive-filter (string)
          Sets  a  filter to list executions based on whether or not they have
          been redriven.

          For a Distributed Map, redriveFilter sets a  filter  to  list  child
          workflow executions based on whether or not they have been redriven.

          If  you  do  not  provide a redriveFilter , Step Functions returns a
          list of both redriven and non-redriven executions.

          If you provide a state machine ARN in redriveFilter ,  the  API  re-
          turns a validation exception.

          Possible values:

          o REDRIVEN

          o NOT_REDRIVEN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       executions -> (list)
          The list of matching executions.

          (structure)
              Contains details about an execution.

              executionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

              stateMachineArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine that ran
                 the execution.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the execution.

                 A name must not contain:

                 o white space

                 o brackets < > { } [ ]

                 o wildcard characters ? *

                 o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

                 o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

                 To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should  only
                 contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the execution.

              startDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the execution started.

              stopDate -> (timestamp)
                 If  the  execution  already  ended,  the  date  the execution
                 stopped.

              mapRunArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Map Run.  This  field  is
                 returned  only  if  mapRunArn was specified in the ListExecu-
                 tions API action. If stateMachineArn was specified in ListEx-
                 ecutions , the mapRunArn isn't returned.

              itemCount -> (integer)
                 The  total number of items processed in a child workflow exe-
                 cution. This field is returned only if mapRunArn  was  speci-
                 fied in the ListExecutions API action. If stateMachineArn was
                 specified in ListExecutions , the itemCount field  isn't  re-
                 turned.

              stateMachineVersionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine version
                 associated with the execution.

                 If the state machine execution was started with  an  unquali-
                 fied ARN, it returns null.

                 If  the  execution was started using a stateMachineAliasArn ,
                 both the stateMachineAliasArn and stateMachineVersionArn  pa-
                 rameters contain the respective values.

              stateMachineAliasArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the state machine alias
                 used to start an execution.

                 If the state machine execution was started with  an  unquali-
                 fied ARN or a version ARN, it returns null.

              redriveCount -> (integer)
                 The number of times you've redriven an execution. If you have
                 not yet redriven an execution, the redriveCount  is  0.  This
                 count is only updated when you successfully redrive an execu-
                 tion.

              redriveDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the execution was last redriven.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination  token  will  return  an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
