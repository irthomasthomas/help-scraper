UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()                                  UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       update-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing state machine by modifying its definition , roleArn
       , loggingConfiguration , or EncryptionConfiguration  .  Running  execu-
       tions  will  continue  to use the previous definition and roleArn . You
       must include at least one of definition or roleArn or you will  receive
       a MissingRequiredParameter error.

       A qualified state machine ARN refers to a Distributed Map state defined
       within a state machine. For example, the qualified  state  machine  ARN
       arn:partition:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:stateMachine-
       Name/mapStateLabel refers to a Distributed Map state with a label  map-
       StateLabel in the state machine named stateMachineName .

       A  qualified  state  machine  ARN can either refer to a Distributed Map
       state defined within a state machine, a version ARN, or an alias ARN.

       The following are some examples of qualified and unqualified state  ma-
       chine ARNs:

       o The following qualified state machine ARN refers to a Distributed Map
         state with a label mapStateLabel in a state machine named  myStateMa-
         chine   .    arn:partition:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:myS-
         tateMachine/mapStateLabel

       NOTE:
          If you provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to  a  Dis-
          tributed Map state , the request fails with ValidationException .

       o The  following  qualified  state machine ARN refers to an alias named
         PROD     .      arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<account-id>:stateMa-
         chine:<myStateMachine:PROD>

       NOTE:
          If  you  provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to a ver-
          sion ARN or an alias ARN, the request starts execution for that ver-
          sion or alias.

       o The following unqualified state machine ARN refers to a state machine
         named    myStateMachine    .     arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<ac-
         count-id>:stateMachine:<myStateMachine>

       After  you update your state machine, you can set the publish parameter
       to true in the same action to publish a new version . This way, you can
       opt-in to strict versioning of your state machine.

       NOTE:
          Step  Functions  assigns monotonically increasing integers for state
          machine versions, starting at version number 1.

       NOTE:
          All StartExecution calls within a few seconds use the updated  defi-
          nition  and  roleArn . Executions started immediately after you call
          UpdateStateMachine may use the previous state machine definition and
          roleArn .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
