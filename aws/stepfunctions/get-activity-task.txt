GET-ACTIVITY-TASK()                                        GET-ACTIVITY-TASK()



NAME
       get-activity-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  workers  to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN)
       which has been scheduled for execution by a running state machine. This
       initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open
       and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution  of
       a  task  of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on
       to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available
       within 60 seconds, the poll returns a taskToken with a null string.

       NOTE:
          This API action isn't logged in CloudTrail.

       WARNING:
          Workers  should  set their client side socket timeout to at least 65
          seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold
          the poll request).

          Polling  with  GetActivityTask can cause latency in some implementa-
          tions. See Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks in the Step
          Functions Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --activity-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the activity to retrieve tasks
          from (assigned when you create the task using  CreateActivity .)

       --worker-name (string)
          You can provide an arbitrary name in order to  identify  the  worker
          that the task is assigned to. This name is used when it is logged in
          the execution history.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       taskToken -> (string)
          A token that identifies the  scheduled  task.  This  token  must  be
          copied  and  included  in  subsequent  calls to  SendTaskHeartbeat ,
          SendTaskSuccess or  SendTaskFailure in order to report the  progress
          or completion of the task.

       input -> (string)
          The  string  that  contains the JSON input data for the task. Length
          constraints apply to the payload size, and are expressed as bytes in
          UTF-8 encoding.
