TEST-STATE()                                                      TEST-STATE()



NAME
       test-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Accepts  the definition of a single state and executes it. You can test
       a state without creating a state machine or updating an existing  state
       machine. Using this API, you can test the following:

       o A state's input and output processing data flow

       o An Amazon Web Services service integration request and response

       o An HTTP Task request and response

       You  can call this API on only one state at a time. The states that you
       can test include the following:

       o All Task types except Activity

       o Pass

       o Wait

       o Choice

       o Succeed

       o Fail

       The TestState API assumes an IAM role which must contain  the  required
       IAM permissions for the resources your state is accessing. For informa-
       tion about the permissions a state might need, see IAM  permissions  to
       test a state .

       The TestState API can run for up to five minutes. If the execution of a
       state exceeds this duration, it fails with the States.Timeout error.
          TestState doesn't support Activity tasks , .sync or  .waitForTaskTo-
          ken  service integration patterns , Parallel , or Map states.

OPTIONS
       --definition (string)
          The Amazon States Language (ASL) definition of the state.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the execution role with the re-
          quired IAM permissions for the state.

       --input (string)
          A string that contains the JSON input data for the state.

       --inspection-level (string)
          Determines the values to return when a  state  is  tested.  You  can
          specify one of the following types:

          o INFO  :  Shows  the final state output. By default, Step Functions
            sets inspectionLevel to INFO if you don't specify a level.

          o DEBUG : Shows the final state output along with the input and out-
            put data processing result.

          o TRACE : Shows the HTTP request and response for an HTTP Task. This
            level also shows the final state output along with the  input  and
            output data processing result.

          Each  of  these  levels also provide information about the status of
          the state execution and the next state to transition to.

          Possible values:

          o INFO

          o DEBUG

          o TRACE

       --reveal-secrets | --no-reveal-secrets (boolean)
          Specifies whether or not to include secret information in  the  test
          result.  For  HTTP  Tasks, a secret includes the data that an Event-
          Bridge connection adds to modify the HTTP request headers, query pa-
          rameters,  and body. Step Functions doesn't omit any information in-
          cluded in the state definition or the HTTP response.

          If you set revealSecrets to true , you must make sure that  the  IAM
          user  that calls the TestState API has permission for the states:Re-
          vealSecrets action. For an example  of  IAM  policy  that  sets  the
          states:RevealSecrets permission, see IAM permissions to test a state
          . Without this permission, Step Functions throws  an  access  denied
          error.

          By default, revealSecrets is set to false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
