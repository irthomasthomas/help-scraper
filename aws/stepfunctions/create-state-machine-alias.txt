CREATE-STATE-MACHINE-ALIAS()                      CREATE-STATE-MACHINE-ALIAS()



NAME
       create-state-machine-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an alias for a state machine that points to one or two versions
       of the same state machine. You can set your application to call   Star-
       tExecution  with an alias and update the version the alias uses without
       changing the client's code.

       You can also map an alias to split  StartExecution requests between two
       versions of a state machine. To do this, add a second RoutingConfig ob-
       ject in the routingConfiguration parameter. You must also  specify  the
       percentage  of  execution  run  requests each version should receive in
       both RoutingConfig objects. Step Functions randomly chooses which  ver-
       sion runs a given execution based on the percentage you specify.

       To  create  an  alias that points to a single version, specify a single
       RoutingConfig object with a weight set to 100.

       You can create up to 100 aliases  for  each  state  machine.  You  must
       delete unused aliases using the  DeleteStateMachineAlias API action.
          CreateStateMachineAlias  is  an idempotent API. Step Functions bases
          the idempotency check on the stateMachineArn , description , name  ,
          and  routingConfiguration parameters. Requests that contain the same
          values for these parameters return a successful idempotent  response
          without creating a duplicate resource.

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          A description for the state machine alias.

       --name (string)
          The name of the state machine alias.

          To  avoid  conflict  with  version ARNs, don't use an integer in the
          name of the alias.

       --routing-configuration (list)
          The routing configuration of a state machine alias. The routing con-
          figuration  shifts  execution traffic between two state machine ver-
          sions. routingConfiguration contains an array of  RoutingConfig  ob-
          jects  that specify up to two state machine versions. Step Functions
          then randomly choses which version to run an execution with based on
          the weight assigned to each RoutingConfig .

          (structure)
              Contains  details about the routing configuration of a state ma-
              chine alias. In a routing configuration, you define an array  of
              objects  that specify up to two state machine versions. You also
              specify the percentage of traffic to be routed to each version.

              stateMachineVersionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  identifies  one  or  two
                 state machine versions defined in the routing configuration.

                 If you specify the ARN of a second version, it must belong to
                 the same state machine as the first version.

              weight -> (integer)
                 The percentage of traffic you want to route to  a  state  ma-
                 chine version. The sum of the weights in the routing configu-
                 ration must be equal to 100.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          stateMachineVersionArn=string,weight=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "stateMachineVersionArn": "string",
              "weight": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
