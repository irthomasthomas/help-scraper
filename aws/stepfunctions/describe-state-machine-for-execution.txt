NAME
       describe-state-machine-for-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information about a state machine's definition, its execution
       role ARN, and configuration. If a Map  Run  dispatched  the  execution,
       this  action  returns the Map Run Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the re-
       sponse. The state machine returned is the state machine associated with
       the Map Run.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution you want  state  ma-
          chine information for.

       --included-data (string)
          If  your state machine definition is encrypted with a KMS key, call-
          ers must have kms:Decrypt permission to decrypt the definition.  Al-
          ternatively,  you can call the API with includedData = METADATA_ONLY
          to get a successful response without the encrypted definition.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_DATA

          o METADATA_ONLY

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The  LoggingConfiguration  data  type is used to set CloudWatch Logs
          options.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines whether execution data is included in your log.  When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          Use the state machine revisionId parameter to compare  the  revision
          of  a state machine with the configuration of the state machine used
          for executions without performing a diff of the properties, such  as
