DESCRIBE-EXECUTION()                                      DESCRIBE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       describe-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about a state machine execution, such as the state
       machine associated with the execution, the execution input and  output,
       and  relevant  execution metadata. If you've redriven an execution, you
       can use this API action to return information  about  the  redrives  of
       that  execution. In addition, you can use this API action to return the
       Map Run Amazon Resource Name (ARN) if the execution was dispatched by a
       Map Run.

       If you specify a version or alias ARN when you call the  StartExecution
       API action, DescribeExecution returns that ARN.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       Executions of an EXPRESS state machine aren't supported by DescribeExe-
       cution unless a Map Run dispatched them.

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       executionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the executed stated machine.

       name -> (string)

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       status -> (string)
          The current status of the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.

       stopDate -> (timestamp)
          If the execution ended, the date the execution stopped.

       input -> (string)
          The string that contains the  JSON  input  data  of  the  execution.
          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       inputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether input or output was included in the  response.
              Always true for API calls.

       output -> (string)
          The  JSON  output data of the execution. Length constraints apply to
          the payload size, and are expressed as bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

          NOTE:
              This field is set only if the execution succeeds. If the  execu-
              tion fails, this field is null.

       outputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether input or output was included in the response.
              Always true for API calls.

       traceHeader -> (string)
          The X-Ray trace header that was passed to the execution.

       mapRunArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies a Map Run, which dis-
          patched this execution.

       error -> (string)
          The error string if the state machine execution failed.

       cause -> (string)
          The cause string if the state machine execution failed.

       stateMachineVersionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine version associ-
          ated with the execution. The version ARN is a combination  of  state
          machine ARN and the version number separated by a colon (:). For ex-
          ample, stateMachineARN:1 .

          If you start an execution  from  a  StartExecution  request  without
          specifying  a state machine version or alias ARN, Step Functions re-
          turns a null value.

       stateMachineAliasArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine alias associated
          with  the execution. The alias ARN is a combination of state machine
          ARN and the alias name  separated  by  a  colon  (:).  For  example,
          stateMachineARN:PROD .

          If you start an execution from a StartExecution request with a state
          machine version ARN, this field will be null.

       redriveCount -> (integer)
          The number of times you've redriven an execution. If  you  have  not
          yet redriven an execution, the redriveCount is 0. This count is only
          updated if you successfully redrive an execution.

       redriveDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution was  last  redriven.  If  you  have  not  yet
          redriven an execution, the redriveDate is null.

          The  redriveDate is unavailable if you redrive a Map Run that starts
          child workflow executions of type EXPRESS .

       redriveStatus -> (string)
          Indicates whether or not an execution can be  redriven  at  a  given
          point in time.

          o For  executions of type STANDARD , redriveStatus is NOT_REDRIVABLE
            if calling the  RedriveExecution API action would return the  Exe-
            cutionNotRedrivable error.

          o For  a Distributed Map that includes child workflows of type STAN-
            DARD , redriveStatus indicates whether or  not  the  Map  Run  can
            redrive child workflow executions.

          o For  a  Distributed  Map that includes child workflows of type EX-
            PRESS , redriveStatus indicates whether or not  the  Map  Run  can
            redrive child workflow executions. You can redrive failed or timed
            out EXPRESS workflows only if they're a part of a  Map  Run.  When
            you  redrive  the Map Run, these workflows are restarted using the
            StartExecution API action.

       redriveStatusReason -> (string)
          When redriveStatus is NOT_REDRIVABLE , redriveStatusReason specifies
          the reason why an execution cannot be redriven.

          o For  executions  of  type STANDARD , or for a Distributed Map that
            includes child workflows of type  STANDARD  ,  redriveStatusReason
            can include one of the following reasons:

            o State machine is in DELETING status .

            o Execution is RUNNING and cannot be redriven .

            o Execution is SUCCEEDED and cannot be redriven .

            o Execution was started before the launch of RedriveExecution .

            o Execution history event limit exceeded .

            o Execution has exceeded the max execution time .

            o Execution redrivable period exceeded .

          o For  a  Distributed  Map that includes child workflows of type EX-
            PRESS , redriveStatusReason is only returned if  the  child  work-
            flows are not redrivable. This happens when the child workflow ex-
            ecutions have completed successfully.
