START-EXECUTION()                                            START-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a state machine execution.

       A  qualified  state  machine  ARN can either refer to a Distributed Map
       state defined within a state machine, a version ARN, or an alias ARN.

       The following are some examples of qualified and unqualified state  ma-
       chine ARNs:

       o The following qualified state machine ARN refers to a Distributed Map
         state with a label mapStateLabel in a state machine named  myStateMa-
         chine   .    arn:partition:states:region:account-id:stateMachine:myS-
         tateMachine/mapStateLabel

       NOTE:
          If you provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to  a  Dis-
          tributed Map state , the request fails with ValidationException .

       o The  following  qualified  state machine ARN refers to an alias named
         PROD     .      arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<account-id>:stateMa-
         chine:<myStateMachine:PROD>

       NOTE:
          If  you  provide a qualified state machine ARN that refers to a ver-
          sion ARN or an alias ARN, the request starts execution for that ver-
          sion or alias.

       o The following unqualified state machine ARN refers to a state machine
         named    myStateMachine    .     arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<ac-
         count-id>:stateMachine:<myStateMachine>

       If  you  start an execution with an unqualified state machine ARN, Step
       Functions uses the latest revision of the state machine for the  execu-
       tion.

       To  start  executions  of a state machine version , call StartExecution
       and provide the version ARN or the ARN of an alias that points  to  the
       version.

       NOTE:
          StartExecution  is idempotent for STANDARD workflows. For a STANDARD
          workflow, if you call StartExecution with the same name and input as
          a  running execution, the call succeeds and return the same response
          as the original request. If the execution is closed or if the  input
          is different, it returns a 400 ExecutionAlreadyExists error. You can
          reuse names after 90 days.

          StartExecution isn't idempotent for EXPRESS workflows.

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

          The stateMachineArn parameter accepts one of the following inputs:

          o An unqualified state machine ARN  Refers to a  state  machine  ARN
            that isn't qualified with a version or alias ARN. The following is
            an example of  an  unqualified  state  machine  ARN.   arn:<parti-
            tion>:states:<region>:<account-id>:stateMachine:<myStateMachine>
            Step Functions doesn't associate state machine executions that you
            start with an unqualified ARN with a version. This is true even if
            that version uses the same revision that the execution used.

          o A state machine version ARN  Refers to a version ARN, which  is  a
            combination  of state machine ARN and the version number separated
            by a colon (:). The following is an example of the ARN for version
            10.          arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<account-id>:stateMa-
            chine:<myStateMachine>:10   Step Functions doesn't associate  exe-
            cutions  that  you  start with a version ARN with any aliases that
            point to that version.

          o A state machine alias ARN  Refers to an alias ARN, which is a com-
            bination  of  state  machine ARN and the alias name separated by a
            colon (:). The following is an example of the  ARN  for  an  alias
            named       PROD      .       arn:<partition>:states:<region>:<ac-
            count-id>:stateMachine:<myStateMachine:PROD>   Step Functions  as-
            sociates  executions  that  you  start with an alias ARN with that
            alias and the state machine version used for that execution.

       --name (string)
          Optional name of the execution. This name must be  unique  for  your
          Amazon  Web Services account, Region, and state machine for 90 days.
          For more information, see Limits Related to State Machine Executions
          in the Step Functions Developer Guide .

          If  you don't provide a name for the execution, Step Functions auto-
          matically generates a universally unique identifier  (UUID)  as  the
          execution name.

          A name must not contain:

          o white space

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

          o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

          o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       --input (string)
          The string that contains the JSON input data for the execution,  for
          example:
              "input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"

          NOTE:
              If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include
              the two braces, for example: "input": "{}"

          Length constraints apply to the payload size, and are  expressed  as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       --trace-header (string)
          Passes  the  X-Ray trace header. The trace header can also be passed
          in the request payload.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       executionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.
