START-EXECUTION()                                            START-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a state machine execution.

       NOTE:
          StartExecution  is  idempotent. If StartExecution is called with the
          same name and input as a running execution, the  call  will  succeed
          and  return the same response as the original request. If the execu-
          tion is closed or if the input is different, it will  return  a  400
          ExecutionAlreadyExists error. Names can be reused after 90 days.

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

       --name (string)
          The name of the execution. This name must be unique for your AWS ac-
          count, region, and state machine for 90 days. For more  information,
          see Limits Related to State Machine Executions in the AWS Step Func-
          tions Developer Guide .

          A name must not contain:

          o white space

          o brackets < > { } [ ]

          o wildcard characters ? *

          o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

          o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

          To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should only contain
          0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

       --input (string)
          The  string that contains the JSON input data for the execution, for
          example:
              "input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"

          NOTE:
              If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include
              the two braces, for example: "input": "{}"

          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       --trace-header (string)
          Passes the AWS X-Ray trace header. The  trace  header  can  also  be
          passed in the request payload.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       executionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.
