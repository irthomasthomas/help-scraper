REDRIVE-EXECUTION()                                        REDRIVE-EXECUTION()



NAME
       redrive-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Restarts unsuccessful executions of Standard workflows that didn't com-
       plete successfully in the last 14 days. These include failed,  aborted,
       or  timed  out  executions. When you redrive an execution, it continues
       the failed execution from the unsuccessful step and uses the  same  in-
       put.  Step Functions preserves the results and execution history of the
       successful steps, and doesn't rerun these steps when you redrive an ex-
       ecution.  Redriven executions use the same state machine definition and
       execution ARN as the original execution attempt.

       For workflows that include an Inline Map or Parallel state, RedriveExe-
       cution  API  action  reschedules  and  redrives only the iterations and
       branches that failed or aborted.

       To redrive a workflow that includes a Distributed Map state with failed
       child  workflow  executions, you must redrive the parent workflow . The
       parent workflow redrives all the unsuccessful  states,  including  Dis-
       tributed Map.

       NOTE:
          This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

          However,  you  can  restart  the  unsuccessful executions of Express
          child workflows in a Distributed Map by redriving its Map Run.  When
          you  redrive  a Map Run, the Express child workflows are rerun using
          the  StartExecution API action. For more information, see  Redriving
          Map Runs .

       You can redrive executions if your original execution meets the follow-
       ing conditions:

       o The execution status isn't SUCCEEDED .

       o Your workflow execution has not exceeded the redrivable period of  14
         days.  Redrivable  period  refers  to  the  time during which you can
         redrive a given execution. This period starts from the  day  a  state
         machine completes its execution.

       o The  workflow execution has not exceeded the maximum open time of one
         year. For more information about state machine quotas, see Quotas re-
         lated to state machine executions .

       o The  execution event history count is less than 24,999. Redriven exe-
         cutions append their event history to  the  existing  event  history.
         Make sure your workflow execution contains less than 24,999 events to
         accommodate the ExecutionRedriven history  event  and  at  least  one
         other history event.

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution to be redriven.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          Amazon  Web  Services SDK automatically generates a client token and
          uses it for the request to ensure idempotency. The API uses  one  of
          the last 10 client tokens provided.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       redriveDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution was last redriven.
