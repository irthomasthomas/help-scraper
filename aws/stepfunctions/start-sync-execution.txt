OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

       --name (string)
          The name of the execution.

       --input (string)
          The  string that contains the JSON input data for the execution, for
          example:
              "input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"

          NOTE:
              If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include
              the two braces, for example: "input": "{}"

          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       --trace-header (string)
          Passes the AWS X-Ray trace header. The  trace  header  can  also  be
          passed in the request payload.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          A more detailed explanation of the cause of the failure.

       input -> (string)
          The string that contains the  JSON  input  data  of  the  execution.
          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       inputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)

          NOTE:
              This field is set only if the execution succeeds. If the  execu-
              tion fails, this field is null.
