CREATE-STATE-MACHINE()                                  CREATE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       create-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  state  machine. A state machine consists of a collection of
       states that can do work (Task states), determine  to  which  states  to
       transition  next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail
       states), and so on. State machines are specified  using  a  JSON-based,
       structured  language.  For more information, see Amazon States Language
       in the Step Functions User Guide.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       NOTE:
          CreateStateMachine  is  an  idempotent API. Subsequent requests wont
          create a duplicate resource if  it  was  already  created.  CreateS-
          tateMachine  's idempotency check is based on the state machine name
          , definition , type , LoggingConfiguration and  TracingConfiguration
          .  If  a  following  request  has a different roleArn or tags , Step
          Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as  an  idempo-
          tent  request  of  the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will
          not be updated, even if they are different.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the created state ma-
          chine.
