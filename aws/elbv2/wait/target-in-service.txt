TARGET-IN-SERVICE()                                        TARGET-IN-SERVICE()



NAME
       target-in-service -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait until JMESPath query TargetHealthDescriptions[].TargetHealth.State
       returns healthy  for  all  elements  when  polling  with  describe-tar-
       get-health.  It will poll every 15 seconds until a successful state has
       been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after 40  failed
       checks.

OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --targets (list)
          The targets.

          (structure)
              Information about a target.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID of the target. If the target type of the target group
                 is instance , specify an instance ID. If the target  type  is
                 ip  ,  specify  an IP address. If the target type is lambda ,
                 specify the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
                 alb  ,  specify the ARN of the Application Load Balancer tar-
                 get.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port on which the target  is  listening.  If  the  target
                 group  protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081. If the
                 target type is alb , the targeted Application  Load  Balancer
                 must have at least one listener whose port matches the target
                 group port. Not used if the target is a Lambda function.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 An Availability Zone or all .  This  determines  whether  the
                 target  receives  traffic from the load balancer nodes in the
                 specified Availability Zone or from all enabled  Availability
                 Zones for the load balancer.

                 For  Application  Load  Balancer target groups, the specified
                 Availability Zone value is only  applicable  when  cross-zone
                 load balancing is off. Otherwise the parameter is ignored and
                 treated as all .

                 This parameter is not supported if the  target  type  of  the
                 target group is instance or alb .

                 If the target type is ip and the IP address is in a subnet of
                 the VPC for the target group, the Availability Zone is  auto-
                 matically  detected and this parameter is optional. If the IP
                 address is outside the VPC, this parameter is required.

                 For Application Load Balancer target groups  with  cross-zone
                 load  balancing  off, if the target type is ip and the IP ad-
                 dress is outside of the VPC for the target group, this should
                 be an Availability Zone inside the VPC for the target group.

                 If the target type is lambda , this parameter is optional and
                 the only supported value is all .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Port=integer,AvailabilityZone=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Port": integer,
              "AvailabilityZone": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To pause running until a registered target is in service

       The following wait target-in-service command pauses and continues  only
       after it confirms that the specified target is in service.

          aws elbv2 wait target-in-service
                 --target-group-arn                 arn:aws:elasticloadbalanc-
                 ing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-tar-
