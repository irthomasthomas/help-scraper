LOAD-BALANCERS-DELETED()                              LOAD-BALANCERS-DELETED()



NAME
       load-balancers-deleted -

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  LoadBalancerNotFound  is  thrown  when  polling  with  de-
       scribe-load-balancers. It will poll every 15 seconds until a successful
       state  has been reached. This will exit with a return code of 255 after
       40 failed checks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       load-balancers-deleted is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: LoadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            load-balancers-deleted
          [--load-balancer-arns <value>]
          [--names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the load balancers. You can spec-
          ify up to 20 load balancers in a single call.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --names (list)
          The names of the load balancers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To pause running until a load balancer is deleted

       The  following wait load-balancers-deleted command pauses and continues
       only after it confirms that the specified load balancer is deleted.

          aws elbv2 wait load-balancers-deleted
                 --load-balancer-arns               arn:aws:elasticloadbalanc-
                 ing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-bal-
                 ancer/50dc6c495c0c9188

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
