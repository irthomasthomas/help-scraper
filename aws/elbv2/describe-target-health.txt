OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --targets (list)
          The targets.

          (structure)
              Information about a target.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID of the target. If the target type of the target group
                 is instance , specify an instance ID. If the target  type  is
                 ip  ,  specify  an IP address. If the target type is lambda ,
                 specify the ARN of the Lambda function. If the target type is
                 alb  ,  specify the ARN of the Application Load Balancer tar-
                 get.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port on which the target  is  listening.  If  the  target
                 group  protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081. If the
                 target type is alb , the targeted Application  Load  Balancer
                 must have at least one listener whose port matches the target
                 group port. This parameter is not used if  the  target  is  a
                 Lambda function.

              AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                 An  Availability  Zone  or  all . This determines whether the
                 target receives traffic from the load balancer nodes  in  the
                 specified  Availability Zone or from all enabled Availability
                 Zones for the load balancer.

                 For Application Load Balancer target  groups,  the  specified
                 Availability  Zone  value  is only applicable when cross-zone
                 load balancing is off. Otherwise the parameter is ignored and
                 treated as all .

                 This  parameter  is  not  supported if the target type of the
                 target group is instance or alb .

                 If the target type is ip and the IP address is in a subnet of
                 the  VPC for the target group, the Availability Zone is auto-
                 matically detected and this parameter is optional. If the  IP
                 address is outside the VPC, this parameter is required.

                 For  Application  Load Balancer target groups with cross-zone
                 load balancing off, if the target type is ip and the  IP  ad-
                 dress is outside of the VPC for the target group, this should
                 be an Availability Zone inside the VPC for the target group.

                 If the target type is lambda , this parameter is optional and
                 the only supported value is all .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,Port=integer,AvailabilityZone=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "Port": integer,
              "AvailabilityZone": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include (list)
          Used to include anomaly detection information.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            AnomalyDetection
            All

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe the health of the targets for a target group

       The following describe-target-health example  displays  health  details
       for  the  targets  of  the  specified  target  group. These targets are
       healthy.

          aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
              --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       Output:

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {

                          "Id": "i-ceddcd4d",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {

                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe the health of a target

       The following describe-target-health example  displays  health  details
       for the specified target. This target is healthy.

          aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
              --targets Id=i-0f76fade,Port=80 \
              --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       Output:

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "healthy"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following example output is for a target whose target group is not
       specified in an action for a listener. This target can't receive  traf-
       fic from the load balancer.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
              {
                  "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                  "Target": {
                      "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                      "Port": 80
                  },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unused",
                          "Reason": "Target.NotInUse",
                          "Description": "Target group is not configured to receive traffic from the load balancer"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following  example  output  is for a target whose target group was
       just specified in an action for a listener. The target is  still  being
       registered.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "initial",
                          "Reason": "Elb.RegistrationInProgress",
                          "Description": "Target registration is in progress"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following example output is for an unhealthy target.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "HealthCheckPort": "80",
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "i-0f76fade",
                          "Port": 80
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unhealthy",
                          "Reason": "Target.Timeout",
                          "Description": "Connection to target timed out"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       The  following example output is for a target that is a Lambda function
       and health checks are disabled.

          {
              "TargetHealthDescriptions": [
                  {
                      "Target": {
                          "Id": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function",
                          "AvailabilityZone": "all",
                      },
                      "TargetHealth": {
                          "State": "unavailable",
                          "Reason": "Target.HealthCheckDisabled",
                          "Description": "Health checks are not enabled for this target"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       TargetHealthDescriptions -> (list)
          Information about the health of the targets.

          (structure)
              Information about the health of a target.

              Target -> (structure)
                 The description of the target.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The ID of the target. If the target type  of  the  target
                     group is instance , specify an instance ID. If the target
                     type is ip , specify an IP address. If the target type is
                     lambda  ,  specify the ARN of the Lambda function. If the
                     target type is alb , specify the ARN of  the  Application
                     Load Balancer target.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The  port on which the target is listening. If the target
                     group protocol is GENEVE, the supported port is 6081.  If
                     the  target  type  is alb , the targeted Application Load
                     Balancer must have  at  least  one  listener  whose  port
                     matches the target group port. This parameter is not used
                     if the target is a Lambda function.

                 AvailabilityZone -> (string)
                     An Availability Zone or all . This determines whether the
                     target  receives  traffic from the load balancer nodes in
                     the specified  Availability  Zone  or  from  all  enabled
                     Availability Zones for the load balancer.

                     For  Application  Load Balancer target groups, the speci-
                     fied Availability Zone  value  is  only  applicable  when
                     cross-zone load balancing is off. Otherwise the parameter
                     is ignored and treated as all .

                     This parameter is not supported if the target type of the
                     target group is instance or alb .

                     If  the target type is ip and the IP address is in a sub-
                     net of the VPC for the  target  group,  the  Availability
                     Zone  is automatically detected and this parameter is op-
                     tional. If the IP address is outside the VPC, this param-
                     eter is required.

                     For   Application   Load   Balancer  target  groups  with
                     cross-zone load balancing off, if the target type  is  ip
                     and  the  IP address is outside of the VPC for the target
                     group, this should be an Availability Zone inside the VPC
                     for the target group.

                     If the target type is lambda , this parameter is optional
                     and the only supported value is all .

              HealthCheckPort -> (string)
                 The port to use to connect with the target.

              TargetHealth -> (structure)
                 The health information for the target.

                 State -> (string)
                     The state of the target.

                 Reason -> (string)
                     The reason code.

                     If the target state is healthy , a  reason  code  is  not
                     provided.

                     If  the  target state is initial , the reason code can be
                     one of the following values:

                     o Elb.RegistrationInProgress  -  The  target  is  in  the
                       process of being registered with the load balancer.

                     o Elb.InitialHealthChecking  - The load balancer is still
                       sending the target the minimum number of health  checks
                       required to determine its health status.

                     If the target state is unhealthy , the reason code can be
                     one of the following values:

                     o Target.ResponseCodeMismatch - The health checks did not

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the target health  that  provides  addi-
                     tional  details.  If the state is healthy , a description
                     is not provided.

              AnomalyDetection -> (structure)
                 The anomaly detection result for the target.

                 If no anomalies were detected, the result is normal .

                 If anomalies were detected, the result is anomalous .

                 Result -> (string)
                     The latest anomaly detection result.
