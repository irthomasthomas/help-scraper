OPTIONS
       --target-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe target group attributes

       The  following  describe-target-group-attributes   example displays the
       attributes of the specified target group.

          aws elbv2 describe-target-group-attributes \
              --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/73e2d6bc24d8a067

       The output includes the attributes if the protocol is HTTP or HTTPS and
       the target type is instance or ip.

          {
              "Attributes": [
                  {
                      "Value": "false",
                      "Key": "stickiness.enabled"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "300",
                      "Key": "deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "lb_cookie",
                      "Key": "stickiness.type"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "86400",
                      "Key": "stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "0",
                      "Key": "slow_start.duration_seconds"
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following output includes the attributes if the protocol is HTTP or
       HTTPS and the target type is lambda.

          {
              "Attributes": [
                  {
                      "Value": "false",
                      "Key": "lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled"
                  }
              ]
          }

       The following output includes the attributes if the  protocol  is  TCP,
       TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP.

          {
              "Attributes": [
                  {
                      "Value": "false",
                      "Key": "proxy_protocol_v2.enabled"
                  },
                  {
                      "Value": "300",
                      "Key": "deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Attributes -> (list)
          Information about the target group attributes

          (structure)
              Information about a target group attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:

                 o deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds  - The amount of time,
                   in seconds, for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  to  wait  before
                   changing  the state of a deregistering target from draining
                   to unused . The range is 0-3600 seconds. The default  value
                   is  300  seconds.  If the target is a Lambda function, this
                   attribute is not supported.

                 The following attributes are supported  by  Application  Load
                 Balancers,  Network  Load  Balancers,  and  Gateway Load Bal-
                 ancers:

                 o stickiness.enabled - Indicates whether target stickiness is
                   enabled.  The value is true or false . The default is false
                   .

                 o stickiness.type - Indicates the  type  of  stickiness.  The
                   possible values are:

                   o lb_cookie and app_cookie for Application Load Balancers

                   o source_ip for Network Load Balancers

                   o source_ip_dest_ip and source_ip_dest_ip_proto for Gateway
                     Load Balancers

                 The following attributes are supported only if the load  bal-
                 ancer  is  an  Application Load Balancer and the target is an
                 instance or an IP address:

                 o load_balancing.algorithm.type - The  load  balancing  algo-
                   rithm determines how the load balancer selects targets when
                   routing requests. The value is  round_robin  or  least_out-
                   standing_requests . The default is round_robin .

                 o slow_start.duration_seconds  - The time period, in seconds,
                   during which a newly registered target receives an increas-
                   ing  share  of  the traffic to the target group. After this
                   time period ends, the target receives  its  full  share  of
                   traffic.  The range is 30-900 seconds (15 minutes). The de-
                   fault is 0 seconds (disabled).

                 o stickiness.app_cookie.cookie_name - Indicates the  name  of
                   the  application-based  cookie.  Names  that start with the
                   following prefixes are not allowed: AWSALB  ,  AWSALBAPP  ,
                   and  AWSALBTG  ;  they're reserved for use by the load bal-
                   ancer.

                 o stickiness.app_cookie.duration_seconds - The  time  period,
                   in  seconds,  during which requests from a client should be
                   routed to the same target. After this time period  expires,
                   the application-based cookie is considered stale. The range
                   is 1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The  default  value
                   is 1 day (86400 seconds).

                 o stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds - The time period, in
                   seconds, during which requests  from  a  client  should  be
                   routed  to the same target. After this time period expires,
                   the load balancer-generated cookie is considered stale. The
                   range  is  1 second to 1 week (604800 seconds). The default
                   value is 1 day (86400 seconds).

                 The following attribute is supported only if  the  load  bal-
                 ancer  is  an  Application  Load Balancer and the target is a
                 Lambda function:

                 o lambda.multi_value_headers.enabled - Indicates whether  the
                   request and response headers that are exchanged between the
                   load balancer and the Lambda  function  include  arrays  of
                   values or strings. The value is true or false . The default
                   is false . If the value is false and the request contains a
                   duplicate  header  field  name  or query parameter key, the
                   load balancer uses the last value sent by the client.

                 The following attributes are supported only by  Network  Load
                 Balancers:

                 o deregistration_delay.connection_termination.enabled - Indi-
                   cates whether the load balancer terminates  connections  at
                   the end of the deregistration timeout. The value is true or
                   false . The default is false .

                 o preserve_client_ip.enabled - Indicates  whether  client  IP
                   preservation  is  enabled. The value is true or false . The
                   default is disabled if the target group type is IP  address
                   and the target group protocol is TCP or TLS. Otherwise, the
                   default is enabled. Client IP preservation cannot  be  dis-
                   abled for UDP and TCP_UDP target groups.

                 o proxy_protocol_v2.enabled  - Indicates whether Proxy Proto-
                   col version 2 is enabled. The value is true or false .  The
                   default is false .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.
