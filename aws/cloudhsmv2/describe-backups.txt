DESCRIBE-BACKUPS()                                          DESCRIBE-BACKUPS()



NAME
       describe-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.

       This  is  a  paginated  operation, which means that each response might
       contain only a subset of all the backups. When  the  response  contains
       only a subset of backups, it includes a NextToken value. Use this value
       in a subsequent DescribeBackups request to get more backups.  When  you
       receive  a response with no NextToken (or an empty or null value), that
       means there are no more backups to get.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-backups is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Backups

OPTIONS
       --filters (map)
          One or more filters to limit the items returned in the response.

          Use the backupIds filter to return only the specified backups. Spec-
          ify backups by their backup identifier (ID).

          Use the sourceBackupIds filter to return only  the  backups  created
          from  a  source backup. The sourceBackupID of a source backup is re-
          turned by the  CopyBackupToRegion operation.

          Use the clusterIds filter to return only the backups for the  speci-
          fied clusters. Specify clusters by their cluster identifier (ID).

          Use  the  states filter to return only backups that match the speci-
          fied state.

          Use the neverExpires filter to return backups filtered by the  value
          in  the neverExpires parameter. True returns all backups exempt from
          the backup retention policy. False returns all backups with a backup
          retention policy defined at the cluster.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --sort-ascending | --no-sort-ascending (boolean)
          Designates  whether  or  not to sort the return backups by ascending
          chronological order of generation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              All  backup  objects  contain the BackupId , BackupState , Clus-
              terId , and CreateTimestamp parameters. Backups that were copied
              into a destination region additionally contain the CopyTimestamp
              , SourceBackup , SourceCluster , and SourceRegion parameters.  A
              backup that is pending deletion will include the DeleteTimestamp
              parameter.

              BackupId -> (string)
                 The identifier (ID) of the backup.

              BackupState -> (string)
                 The state of the backup.

              ClusterId -> (string)
                 The identifier (ID) of the cluster that was backed up.

              CreateTimestamp -> (timestamp)

              NeverExpires -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the service should exempt a backup from the
                 retention policy for the cluster. True exempts a backup  from
                 the  retention  policy.  False  means the service applies the
                 backup retention policy defined at the cluster.

              SourceRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region that contains the source backup from which the
                 new backup was copied.

              SourceBackup -> (string)
                 The  identifier  (ID) of the source backup from which the new
                 backup was copied.
