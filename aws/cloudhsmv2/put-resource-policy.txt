PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates or updates an CloudHSM resource policy. A resource policy helps
       you to define the IAM entity (for example, an Amazon Web  Services  ac-
       count) that can manage your CloudHSM resources. The following resources
       support CloudHSM resource policies:

       o Backup - The resource policy allows you to describe  the  backup  and
         restore  a cluster from the backup in another Amazon Web Services ac-
         count.

       In order to share a backup, it must be in a 'READY' state and you  must
       own it.

       WARNING:
              While  you can share a backup using the CloudHSM PutResourcePol-
              icy operation, we recommend using Resource Access Manager  (RAM)
              instead.  Using RAM provides multiple benefits as it creates the
              policy for you, allows multiple resources to be  shared  at  one
              time,  and increases the discoverability of shared resources. If
              you use PutResourcePolicy and want consumers to be able  to  de-
              scribe  the  backups  you  share with them, you must promote the
              backup to a standard RAM Resource Share using the RAM PromoteRe-
              sourceShareCreatedFromPolicy  API  operation.  For more informa-
              tion, see Working with shared backups in the CloudHSM User Guide

          Cross-account use: No. You  cannot  perform  this  operation  on  an
          CloudHSM resource in a different Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which you want to at-
          tach a policy.

       --policy (string)
          The policy you want to associate with a resource.

          For an example policy,  see  Working  with  shared  backups  in  the
          CloudHSM User Guide

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ResourceArn -> (string)
          Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to which a policy is at-
          tached.

       Policy -> (string)
          The policy attached to a resource.
