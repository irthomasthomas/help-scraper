OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The  identifier  (ID)  of  the backup to modify. To find the ID of a
          backup, use the  DescribeBackups operation.

       --never-expires | --no-never-expires (boolean)
          Specifies whether the service should exempt a backup from the reten-
          tion  policy  for the cluster. True exempts a backup from the reten-
          tion policy. False means the service applies  the  backup  retention
          policy defined at the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          backup  objects contain the BackupId , BackupState , ClusterId , and
          CreateTimestamp parameters. Backups that were copied into a destina-
          tion  region additionally contain the CopyTimestamp , SourceBackup ,
          SourceCluster , and SourceRegion parameters. A backup that is  pend-
          ing deletion will include the DeleteTimestamp parameter.

          BackupId -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the backup.

          BackupState -> (string)
              The state of the backup.

          ClusterId -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the cluster that was backed up.

          CreateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the backup was created.

          CopyTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and  time  when  the  backup was copied from a source
              backup.

          NeverExpires -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the service should exempt a  backup  from  the
              retention policy for the cluster. True exempts a backup from the
              retention policy. False means the service applies the backup re-
              tention policy defined at the cluster.

          SourceRegion -> (string)
              The  AWS  Region  that contains the source backup from which the
              new backup was copied.

          SourceBackup -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the source  backup  from  which  the  new
              backup was copied.

          SourceCluster -> (string)
              The  identifier (ID) of the cluster containing the source backup
              from which the new backup was copied.

          DeleteTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the backup will be permanently deleted.

          TagList -> (list)
              The list of tags for the backup.

              (structure)
                 Contains a tag. A tag is a key-value pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.
