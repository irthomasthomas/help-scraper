OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier assigned to this job when it was created.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing associated with the device.

       --status (string)
          The  new status for the job execution (IN_PROGRESS, FAILED, SUCCESS,
          or REJECTED). This must be specified on every update.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o REJECTED

          o REMOVED

          o CANCELED

       --status-details (map)
          Optional. A collection of name/value pairs that describe the  status
          of  the  job  execution. If not specified, the statusDetails are un-
          changed.

          The maximum length of the value in  the  name/value  pair  is  1,024
          characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --step-timeout-in-minutes (long)
          Specifies  the amount of time this device has to finish execution of
          this job. If the job execution status is not set to a terminal state
          before  this  timer  expires, or before the timer is reset (by again
          calling UpdateJobExecution , setting the status to IN_PROGRESS , and
          specifying a new timeout value in this field) the job execution sta-
          tus will be automatically set to TIMED_OUT . Note  that  setting  or
          resetting  the step timeout has no effect on the in progress timeout
          that may have been specified when the job was created (CreateJob us-
          ing field timeoutConfig ).

          Valid values for this parameter range from 1 to 10080 (1 minute to 7
          days). A value of -1 is also valid and will cancel the current  step
          timer (created by an earlier use of UpdateJobExecutionRequest ).

       --expected-version (long)
          Optional.  The  expected  current version of the job execution. Each
          time you update the job execution, its version  is  incremented.  If
          the  version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match, the
          update is rejected with a VersionMismatch  error,  and  an  ErrorRe-
          sponse  that  contains  the current job execution status data is re-
          turned. (This  makes  it  unnecessary  to  perform  a  separate  De-
          scribeJobExecution request in order to obtain the job execution sta-
          tus data.)

       --include-job-execution-state | --no-include-job-execution-state (bool-
       ean)
          Optional.  When  included and set to true, the response contains the
          JobExecutionState data. The default is false.

       --include-job-document | --no-include-job-document (boolean)
          Optional. When set to true, the response contains the job  document.
          The default is false.

       --execution-number (long)
          Optional.  A  number that identifies a particular job execution on a
          particular device.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the status of a job execution

       The  following  update-job-execution  example updates the status of the
       specified job and thing.

          aws iot-jobs-data update-job-execution \
              --job-id SampleJob \
              --thing-name MotionSensor1 \
              --status REMOVED \
              --endpoint-url https://1234567890abcd.jobs.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       Output:

          {
              "executionState": {
                  "status": "REMOVED",
                  "versionNumber": 3
              },
          }
