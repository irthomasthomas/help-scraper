DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  EventBridge  Pipes connects event sources to targets. Pipes re-
       duces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when  de-
       veloping  event  driven  architectures.  This helps ensures consistency
       across your companys applications. With Pipes, the target  can  be  any
       available  EventBridge  target.  To set up a pipe, you select the event
       source, add optional event filtering, define optional  enrichment,  and
       select the target for the event data.
