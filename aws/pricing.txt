DESCRIPTION
       The  Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient
       way to programmatically query Amazon Web Services for  services,  prod-
       ucts,  and pricing information. The Amazon Web Services Price List uses
       standardized product attributes such as Location , Storage Class ,  and
       Operating  System  ,  and provides prices at the SKU level. You can use
       the Amazon Web Services Price List to do the following:

       o Build cost control and scenario planning tools

       o Reconcile billing data

       o Forecast future spend for budgeting purposes

       o Provide cost benefit analysis that compare  your  internal  workloads
         with Amazon Web Services

       Use  GetServices  without  a service code to retrieve the service codes
       for all Amazon Web Services, then GetServices with a  service  code  to
       retrieve  the attribute names for that service. After you have the ser-
       vice code and attribute names, you can use  GetAttributeValues  to  see
       what  values  are available for an attribute. With the service code and
       an attribute name and value, you can use GetProducts to  find  specific
       products that you're interested in, such as an AmazonEC2 instance, with
       a Provisioned IOPS  volumeType .

       For more information, see Using the Amazon Web Services Price List  API
       in the Billing User Guide .
