OPTIONS
       --pool-id (string)
          The identifier of the specified pool to update.

       --description (string)
          Describes the specified pool to update.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The identifier of the bundle.

       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory.

       --capacity (structure)
          The desired capacity for the pool.

          DesiredUserSessions -> (integer)
              The  desired  number  of user sessions for the WorkSpaces in the
              pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DesiredUserSessions=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DesiredUserSessions": integer
          }

       --application-settings (structure)
          The persistent application settings for users in the pool.

          Status -> (string)
              Enables or disables persistent application  settings  for  users
              during their pool sessions.

          SettingsGroup -> (string)
              The  path prefix for the S3 bucket where users persistent appli-
              cation settings are stored. You can allow  the  same  persistent
              application  settings to be used across multiple pools by speci-
              fying the same settings group for each pool.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,SettingsGroup=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED",
            "SettingsGroup": "string"
          }

       --timeout-settings (structure)
          Indicates the timeout settings of the specified pool.

          DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that a streaming  ses-
              sion  remains active after users disconnect. If users try to re-
              connect to the streaming session after a disconnection  or  net-
              work  interruption  within  the  time set, they are connected to
              their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to  a  new
              session with a new streaming instance.

          IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time  in  seconds a connection will stay active
              while idle.

          MaxUserDurationInSeconds -> (integer)
              Specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a stream-
              ing session can remain active. If users are still connected to a
              streaming instance five minutes before this  limit  is  reached,
              they  are  prompted to save any open documents before being dis-
              connected. After this time elapses, the instance  is  terminated
              and replaced by a new instance.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds=integer,IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds=integer,MaxUserDurationInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds": integer,
            "IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds": integer,
            "MaxUserDurationInSeconds": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 The amount of time in seconds a connection will  stay  active
                 while idle.

                 is reached, they are prompted to save any open documents  be-
