NAME
       delete-connection-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  connection  alias.  For  more information, see
       Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

       WARNING:
          If you will no longer be using a fully qualified domain name  (FQDN)
          as  the  registration  code for your WorkSpaces users, you must take
          certain precautions to prevent potential security issues.  For  more
          information, see Security Considerations if You Stop Using Cross-Re-
          gion Redirection .

       NOTE:
          To delete a connection alias that has been shared,  the  shared  ac-
          count must first disassociate the connection alias from any directo-
          ries it has been associated with. Then you must unshare the  connec-
          tion  alias from the account it has been shared with. You can delete
          a connection alias only after it is no longer shared  with  any  ac-
          counts or associated with any directories.

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          The identifier of the connection alias to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
