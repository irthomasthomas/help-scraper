DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()                                    DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       describe-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified WorkSpaces.

       You  can  filter  the results by using the bundle identifier, directory
       identifier, or owner, but you can specify only one filter at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-workspaces is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Workspaces

OPTIONS
       --workspace-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the WorkSpaces. You cannot combine this parameter
          with any other filter.

          Because the  CreateWorkspaces operation is asynchronous, the identi-
          fier  it  returns  is  not immediately available. If you immediately
          call  DescribeWorkspaces with this identifier, no information is re-
          turned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  directory. In addition, you can optionally
          specify a specific directory user (see UserName ). You  cannot  com-
          bine this parameter with any other filter.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the directory user. You must specify this parameter with
          DirectoryId .

       --bundle-id (string)
          The identifier of the bundle. All WorkSpaces that are  created  from
          this  bundle  are  retrieved. You cannot combine this parameter with
          any other filter.

       --workspace-name (string)
          The name of the user-decoupled WorkSpace.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 The operational state of the WorkSpace.

                 o PENDING  The WorkSpace is in a waiting state (for  example,
                   the WorkSpace is being created).

                 o AVAILABLE   The  WorkSpace  is  running  and has passed the
                   health checks.

                 o IMPAIRED  Refer to UNHEALTHY state.

                 o UNHEALTHY   The  WorkSpace  is  not  responding  to  health
                   checks.

                 o REBOOTING  The WorkSpace is being rebooted (restarted).

                 o STARTING   The  WorkSpace  is starting up and health checks

                 o STOPPED  The WorkSpace has been stopped.

                 o ERROR  The WorkSpace is an error state (for example, an er-
                   ror occurred during startup).

                 NOTE:
                     After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state  is
                     returned  only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To  confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the
                     WorkSpace  ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If   the
                     WorkSpace  ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been
                     successfully terminated.
