REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()                  REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       register-workspace-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  the  specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and
       returns before the WorkSpace directory is registered. If  this  is  the
       first time you are registering a directory, you will need to create the
       workspaces_DefaultRole role before you can register  a  directory.  For
       more information, see Creating the workspaces_DefaultRole Role .

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier of the directory. You cannot register a directory if
          it does not have a status of Active. If the directory does not  have
          a  status  of Active, you will receive an InvalidResourceStateExcep-
          tion error. If you have already registered the maximum number of di-
          rectories that you can register with Amazon WorkSpaces, you will re-
          ceive a ResourceLimitExceededException error. Deregister directories
          that you are not using for WorkSpaces, and try again.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the subnets for your virtual private cloud (VPC).
          Make sure that the subnets are in supported Availability Zones.  The
          subnets must also be in separate Availability Zones. If these condi-
          tions are not met, you will receive  an  OperationNotSupportedExcep-
          tion error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enable-work-docs | --no-enable-work-docs (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  Amazon  WorkDocs  is enabled or disabled. If you
          have enabled this parameter and WorkDocs is not available in the Re-
          gion,  you will receive an OperationNotSupportedException error. Set
          EnableWorkDocs to disabled, and try again.

       --enable-self-service | --no-enable-self-service (boolean)
          Indicates whether self-service capabilities are enabled or disabled.

       --tenancy (string)
          Indicates whether your WorkSpace directory is dedicated  or  shared.
          To  use Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images, this value must be set
          to DEDICATED and your Amazon Web Services account  must  be  enabled
          for  BYOL.  If  your account has not been enabled for BYOL, you will
          receive an InvalidParameterValuesException error. For more  informa-
          tion about BYOL images, see Bring Your Own Windows Desktop Images .

          Possible values:

          o DEDICATED

          o SHARED

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the directory.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To register a directory

       The following register-workspace-directory example registers the speci-
       fied directory for use with Amazon WorkSpaces.

          aws workspaces register-workspace-directory \
              --directory-id d-926722edaf \
              --no-enable-work-docs

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Register a directory with WorkSpaces  in  the
       Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
