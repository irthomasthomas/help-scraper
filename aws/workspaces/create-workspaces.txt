CREATE-WORKSPACES()                                        CREATE-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       create-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates one or more WorkSpaces.

       This  operation  is  asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces are
       created.

       NOTE:

          o The  MANUAL  running  mode  value  is  only  supported  by  Amazon
            WorkSpaces  Core.  Contact your account team to be allow-listed to
            use this value. For more information, see Amazon WorkSpaces Core .

          o You don't need to specify the PCOIP protocol for Linux bundles be-
            cause WSP is the default protocol for those bundles.

          o User-decoupled  WorkSpaces are only supported by Amazon WorkSpaces
            Core.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          Because this operation is asynchronous, the identifier  returned  is
          not  immediately  available for use with other operations. For exam-
          ple, if you call  DescribeWorkspaces before the  WorkSpace  is  cre-
          ated, the information returned can be incomplete.

                   health checks.

                 o IMPAIRED  Refer to UNHEALTHY state.

                 o UNHEALTHY   The  WorkSpace  is  not  responding  to  health

                 o SUSPENDED  The WorkSpace has been suspended for image  cre-
                   ation.

                 NOTE:
                     After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state  is
                     returned  only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To  confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the
                     WorkSpace  ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If   the
                     WorkSpace  ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been
                     successfully terminated.
