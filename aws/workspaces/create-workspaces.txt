            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          not immediately available for use with other operations.  For  exam-
          ple,  if  you  call  DescribeWorkspaces before the WorkSpace is cre-
          ated, the information returned can be incomplete.

                 NOTE:
                     After  a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state is
                     returned only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace  directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for  the
                     WorkSpace   ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If  the
                     WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has  been
                     successfully terminated.
