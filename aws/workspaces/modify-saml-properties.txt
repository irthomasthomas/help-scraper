MODIFY-SAML-PROPERTIES()                              MODIFY-SAML-PROPERTIES()



NAME
       modify-saml-properties -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  multiple  properties  related to SAML 2.0 authentication, in-
       cluding the enablement status, user access URL, and relay state parame-
       ter  name  that  are  used  for configuring federation with an SAML 2.0
       identity provider.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-saml-properties
          --resource-id <value>
          [--saml-properties <value>]
          [--properties-to-delete <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The directory identifier for which you want to configure SAML  prop-
          erties.

       --saml-properties (structure)
          The properties for configuring SAML 2.0 authentication.

          Status -> (string)
              Indicates  the status of SAML 2.0 authentication. These statuses
              include the following.

              o If the setting is DISABLED , end users will be directed to lo-
                gin with their directory credentials.

              o If  the setting is ENABLED , end users will be directed to lo-
                gin via the user access URL. Users attempting  to  connect  to
                WorkSpaces  from  a  client  application that does not support
                SAML 2.0 authentication will not be able to connect.

              o If the setting is ENABLED_WITH_DIRECTORY_LOGIN_FALLBACK ,  end
                users  will  be  directed  to login via the user access URL on
                supported client applications, but will  not  prevent  clients
                that do not support SAML 2.0 authentication from connecting as
                if SAML 2.0 authentication was disabled.

          UserAccessUrl -> (string)
              The SAML 2.0 identity provider (IdP) user access URL is the  URL
              a user would navigate to in their web browser in order to feder-
              ate from the IdP and directly access  the  application,  without
              any SAML 2.0 service provider (SP) bindings.

          RelayStateParameterName -> (string)
              The  relay  state parameter name supported by the SAML 2.0 iden-
              tity provider (IdP). When the end user is redirected to the user
              access  URL  from  the WorkSpaces client application, this relay
              state parameter name is appended as a query parameter to the URL
              along  with  the  relay state endpoint to return the user to the
              client application session.

              To use SAML 2.0 authentication with  WorkSpaces,  the  IdP  must
              support IdP-initiated deep linking for the relay state URL. Con-
              sult your IdP documentation for more information.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string,UserAccessUrl=string,RelayStateParameterName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"ENABLED_WITH_DIRECTORY_LOGIN_FALLBACK",
            "UserAccessUrl": "string",
            "RelayStateParameterName": "string"
          }

       --properties-to-delete (list)
          The SAML properties to delete as part of your request.

          Specify one of the following options:

          o SAML_PROPERTIES_USER_ACCESS_URL to delete the user access URL.

          o SAML_PROPERTIES_RELAY_STATE_PARAMETER_NAME  to  delete  the  relay
            state parameter name.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            SAML_PROPERTIES_USER_ACCESS_URL
            SAML_PROPERTIES_RELAY_STATE_PARAMETER_NAME

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
