       portal  company  logo, the support email address, support link, link to
       reset password, and a custom message for users trying to sign in.

       After you delete your customized client branding, your login portal re-
       verts to the default client branding.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-client-branding
          --resource-id <value>
          --platforms <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-id (string)
          The  directory  identifier  of  the  WorkSpace for which you want to
          delete client branding.

       --platforms (list)
          The device type for which you want to delete client branding.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            DeviceTypeWindows
            DeviceTypeOsx
            DeviceTypeAndroid
            DeviceTypeIos
            DeviceTypeLinux
            DeviceTypeWeb

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
