NAME
       update-connection-alias-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Shares  or  unshares  a connection alias with one account by specifying
       whether that account has permission to associate the  connection  alias
       with a directory. If the association permission is granted, the connec-
       tion alias is shared with that account. If the  association  permission
       is revoked, the connection alias is unshared with the account. For more
       information, see Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

       NOTE:

          o Before performing this operation,  call  DescribeConnectionAliases
            to  make  sure  that  the current state of the connection alias is
            CREATED .

          o To delete a connection alias that has been shared, the shared  ac-
            count must first disassociate the connection alias from any direc-
            tories it has been associated with. Then you must unshare the con-
            nection  alias  from  the account it has been shared with. You can
            delete a connection alias only after it is no longer  shared  with
            any accounts or associated with any directories.

OPTIONS
       --alias-id (string)
          The  identifier of the connection alias that you want to update per-
          missions for.

       --connection-alias-permission (structure)
          Indicates whether to share or unshare the connection alias with  the
          specified Amazon Web Services account.

          SharedAccountId -> (string)
              The  identifier of the Amazon Web Services account that the con-
              nection alias is shared with.

          AllowAssociation -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the specified Amazon Web Services  account  is
              allowed to associate the connection alias with a directory.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SharedAccountId=string,AllowAssociation=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SharedAccountId": "string",
            "AllowAssociation": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
