OPTIONS
       --pool-ids (list)
          The identifier of the WorkSpaces Pools.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          The filter conditions for the WorkSpaces Pool to return.

          (structure)
              Describes the filter conditions for WorkSpaces Pools to return.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the pool to filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values for filtering WorkSpaces Pools.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator values for filtering WorkSpaces Pools.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "PoolName",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "EQUALS"|"NOTEQUALS"|"CONTAINS"|"NOTCONTAINS"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return.

       --next-token (string)
          If you received a NextToken from a previous call that was paginated,
          provide this token to receive the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

                     disconnection or network  interruption  within  the  time
                     set, they are connected to their previous session. Other-
                     wise, they are connected to a  new  session  with  a  new
                     streaming instance.

                 IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  amount of time in seconds a connection will stay ac-

                     streaming  session  can remain active. If users are still
                     connected to a streaming  instance  five  minutes  before
                     this limit is reached, they are prompted to save any open
                     documents before  being  disconnected.  After  this  time
                     elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a new
                     instance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you received a NextToken from a previous call that was paginated,
          provide this token to receive the next set of results.
