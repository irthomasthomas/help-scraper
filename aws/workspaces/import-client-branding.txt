IMPORT-CLIENT-BRANDING()                              IMPORT-CLIENT-BRANDING()



NAME
       import-client-branding -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  client  branding. Client branding allows you to customize your
       WorkSpace's client login portal. You can tailor your login portal  com-
       pany logo, the support email address, support link, link to reset pass-
       word, and a custom message for users trying to sign in.

       After you import client branding, the default branding  experience  for
       the specified platform type is replaced with the imported experience

       NOTE:

          o You  must specify at least one platform type when importing client
            branding.

          o You can import up to 6 MB of data with each request. If  your  re-
            quest  exceeds this limit, you can import client branding for dif-
            ferent platform types using separate requests.

          o In each platform type, the SupportEmail and SupportLink parameters
            are  mutually  exclusive.  You  can specify only one parameter for
            each platform type, but not both.

          o Imported data can take up to a minute to appear in the  WorkSpaces
            client.

       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
