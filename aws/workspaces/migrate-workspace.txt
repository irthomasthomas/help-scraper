MIGRATE-WORKSPACE()                                        MIGRATE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       migrate-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Migrates  a  WorkSpace  from one operating system or bundle type to an-
       other, while retaining the data on the user volume.

       The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root  vol-
       ume  from  the  target  bundle  image and the user volume from the last
       available snapshot of the original  WorkSpace.  During  migration,  the
       original   D:\Users\%USERNAME%   user  profile  folder  is  renamed  to
       D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated . A  new  D:\Users\%USER-
       NAME%\ folder is generated by the new OS. Certain files in the old user
       profile are moved to the new user profile.

       For available migration scenarios, details about  what  happens  during
       migration, and best practices, see Migrate a WorkSpace .

SYNOPSIS
            migrate-workspace
          --source-workspace-id <value>
          --bundle-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-workspace-id (string)
          The identifier of the WorkSpace to migrate from.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the target bundle type to migrate the WorkSpace
          to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To migrate a WorkSpace

       The  following  migrate-workspace  example   migrates   the   specified
       WorkSpace to the Standard with Windows 10 (English) public bundle type.

          aws workspaces migrate-workspace \
              --source-workspace-id ws-12345678 \
              --bundle-id wsb-8vbljg4r6

       Output:

          {
              "SourceWorkspaceId": "ws-12345678",
              "TargetWorkspaceId": "ws-87654321"
          }

OUTPUT
       SourceWorkspaceId -> (string)
          The original identifier of the WorkSpace that is being migrated.

       TargetWorkspaceId -> (string)
          The  new  identifier of the WorkSpace that is being migrated. If the
          migration does not succeed, the target  WorkSpace  ID  will  not  be
          used, and the WorkSpace will still have the original WorkSpace ID.
