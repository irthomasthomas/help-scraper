LIST-DISTRIBUTIONS-BY-ORIGIN-RLIST-DISTRIBUTIONS-BY-ORIGIN-REQUEST-POLICY-ID()



NAME
       list-distributions-by-origin-request-policy-id -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of distribution IDs for distributions that have a cache be-
       havior that's associated with the specified origin request policy.

       You can optionally specify the maximum number of items  to  receive  in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum that you specify, or the default maximum, the  response  is  pagi-
       nated.  To  get  the next page of items, send a subsequent request that
       specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the  Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of distribution IDs. The  response  includes  distribution
          IDs in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of
          the list, set this field's value to the value of NextMarker from the
          current page's response.

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum  number  of  distribution  IDs that you want in the re-
          sponse.

       --origin-request-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the origin request policy  whose  associated  distribution
          IDs you want to list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DistributionIdList -> (structure)
          A list of distribution IDs.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value provided in the Marker request field.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              Contains  the value that you should use in the Marker field of a
              subsequent request to continue listing  distribution  IDs  where
              you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of distribution IDs requested.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A flag that indicates whether more distribution IDs remain to be
              listed. If your results were truncated, you can  make  a  subse-
              quent  request  using  the Marker request field to retrieve more
              distribution IDs in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The total number of distribution IDs returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the distribution IDs in the list.

              (string)
