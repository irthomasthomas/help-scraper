OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier of the origin access control.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OriginAccessControlConfig -> (structure)
          Contains an origin access control configuration.

          Name -> (string)
              A name to identify the origin access control. You can specify up
              to 64 characters.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the origin access control.

          SigningProtocol -> (string)
              The signing protocol of the origin access control, which  deter-
              mines  how  CloudFront  signs (authenticates) requests. The only
              valid value is sigv4 .

          SigningBehavior -> (string)
              Specifies which requests CloudFront signs  (adds  authentication
              information  to).  Specify  always for the most common use case.
              For more information, see origin access  control  advanced  set-
              tings in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              This field can have one of the following values:

              o always   CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwriting the
                Authorization header from the viewer request if one exists.

              o never  CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests. This value
                turns off origin access control for all origins in all distri-
                butions that use this origin access control.

              o no-override  If the viewer request doesn't contain the  Autho-
                rization  header, then CloudFront signs the origin request. If
                the viewer request contains  the  Authorization  header,  then
                CloudFront  doesn't sign the origin request and instead passes
                along the Authorization header from the viewer request.  WARN-
                ING:  To  pass  along  the  ``Authorization``  header from the
                viewer request, you *must* add the ``Authorization`` header to
                a   `cache   policy  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloud-
                Front/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`__
                for  all cache behaviors that use origins associated with this
                origin access control.

          OriginAccessControlOriginType -> (string)
              The type of origin that this origin access control is for.

       ETag -> (string)
          The version identifier for the current version of the origin  access
          control.
