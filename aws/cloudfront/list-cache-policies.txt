LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()                                    LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-cache-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of cache policies.

       You  can  optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies
       created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to return only the specified kinds of cache policies. Valid
          values are:

          o managed   Returns  only the managed policies created by Amazon Web
            Services.

          o custom  Returns only the custom policies created  in  your  Amazon
            Web Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of cache policies. The response includes cache policies in
          the  list  that  occur after the marker. To get the next page of the
          list, set this field's value to the value  of  NextMarker  from  the
          current page's response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of cache policies that you want in the response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If  there  are more items in the list than are in this response,
              this element is present. It contains the value that  you  should
              use  in  the  Marker  field  of a subsequent request to continue
              listing cache policies where you left off.

                        The date and time when the cache policy was last modi-
                        fied.

                     CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
                        The cache policy configuration.

                        Comment -> (string)

                            ment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

                        Name -> (string)
                            A unique name to identify the cache policy.

                        DefaultTTL -> (long)
                            The default amount of time, in seconds,  that  you
                            want  objects  to stay in the CloudFront cache be-
                            fore CloudFront sends another request to the  ori-
                            gin  to see if the object has been updated. Cloud-
                            Front uses this value as the object's time to live
                            (TTL)   only   when   the  origin  does  not  send
                            Cache-Control or Expires headers with the  object.

                            Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            The  default value for this field is 86400 seconds
                            (one day). If the value of  MinTTL  is  more  than
                            86400  seconds,  then  the  default value for this
                            field is the same as the value of MinTTL .

                        MaxTTL -> (long)
                            The maximum amount of time, in seconds,  that  ob-
                            jects  stay  in the CloudFront cache before Cloud-
                            Front sends another request to the origin  to  see
                            if  the  object  has been updated. CloudFront uses
                            this value only when the origin  sends  Cache-Con-
                            trol  or Expires headers with the object. For more
                            information, see Managing How Long  Content  Stays

                            Front Developer Guide .

                            The default value for this field is 31536000  sec-
                            onds  (one  year).  If  the value of MinTTL or De-
                            faultTTL is more than 31536000 seconds,  then  the
                            default  value  for  this field is the same as the
                            value of DefaultTTL .

                        MinTTL -> (long)
                            The minimum amount of time, in seconds,  that  you
                            want  objects  to stay in the CloudFront cache be-
                            fore CloudFront sends another request to the  ori-
                            gin  to  see  if  the object has been updated. For

                        ture)
                            The  HTTP  headers, cookies, and URL query strings
                            to include in the cache key. The  values  included
                            in  the  cache  key  are also included in requests
                            that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                               A flag that can affect whether  the  Accept-En-
                               coding HTTP header is included in the cache key
                               and included in requests that CloudFront  sends
                               to the origin.

                               This field is related to the EnableAcceptEncod-
                               ingBrotli field. If one or both of these fields
                               is  true   and  the viewer request includes the
                               Accept-Encoding header,  then  CloudFront  does
                               the following:

                               o Normalizes  the  value  of  the  viewer's Ac-
                                 cept-Encoding header

                               o Includes the normalized header in  the  cache
                                 key

                               o Includes the normalized header in the request
                                 to the origin, if a request is necessary

                               For more information, see  Compression  support
                               in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                               If  you set this value to true , and this cache
                               behavior also has an origin request policy  at-
                               tached,  do  not  include  the  Accept-Encoding
                               header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                               always  includes  the Accept-Encoding header in
                               origin requests when the value of this field is
                               true  ,  so  including this header in an origin
                               request policy has no effect.

                               If both of these fields are false , then Cloud-
                               Front  treats  the  Accept-Encoding  header the
                               same as any other HTTP header in the viewer re-
                               quest.  By  default,  it's  not included in the
                               cache key and it's not included in  origin  re-
                               quests.  In this case, you can manually add Ac-
                               cept-Encoding to the headers whitelist like any
                               other HTTP header.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                               A  flag  that can affect whether the Accept-En-
                               coding HTTP header is included in the cache key
                               and  included in requests that CloudFront sends
                               to the origin.

                            HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                               An object  that  determines  whether  any  HTTP
                               headers (and if so, which headers) are included

                               Front sends to the origin.

                               HeaderBehavior -> (string)
