LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()                                    LIST-CACHE-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-cache-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of cache policies.

       You  can  optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies
       created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to return only the specified kinds of cache policies. Valid
          values are:

          o managed   Returns  only the managed policies created by Amazon Web
            Services.

          o custom  Returns only the custom policies created  in  your  Amazon
            Web Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of cache policies. The response includes cache policies in
          the  list  that  occur after the marker. To get the next page of the
          list, set this fields value to the value of NextMarker from the cur-
          rent pages response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of cache policies that you want in the response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing cache policies where you left off.

                            A unique name to identify the cache policy.

                        DefaultTTL -> (long)
                            The  default  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want objects to stay in the CloudFront  cache  be-
                            fore  CloudFront sends another request to the ori-
                            gin to see if the object has been updated.  Cloud-
                            Front  uses this value as the objects time to live
                            (TTL)  only  when  the  origin   does   not   send
                            Cache-Control  or Expires headers with the object.

                            Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            The default value for this field is 86400  seconds
                            (one  day).  If  the  value of MinTTL is more than
                            86400 seconds, then the  default  value  for  this
                            field is the same as the value of MinTTL .

                        MaxTTL -> (long)
                            The  maximum  amount of time, in seconds, that ob-
                            jects stay in the CloudFront cache  before  Cloud-
                            Front  sends  another request to the origin to see
                            if the object has been  updated.  CloudFront  uses
                            this  value  only when the origin sends Cache-Con-
                            trol or Expires headers with the object. For  more
                            information,  see  Managing How Long Content Stays

                            The  default value for this field is 31536000 sec-
                            onds (one year). If the value  of  MinTTL  or  De-
                            faultTTL  is  more than 31536000 seconds, then the
                            default value for this field is the  same  as  the
                            value of DefaultTTL .

                        MinTTL -> (long)
                            The  minimum  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want objects to stay in the CloudFront  cache  be-
                            fore  CloudFront sends another request to the ori-
                            gin to see if the object  has  been  updated.  For

                        ture)
                            The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL  query  strings
                            to  include  in the cache key. The values included
                            in the cache key are automatically included in re-
                            quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                               A  flag  that can affect whether the Accept-En-
                               coding HTTP header is included in the cache key
                               and  included in requests that CloudFront sends
                               to the origin.

                               This field is related to the EnableAcceptEncod-
                               ingBrotli field. If one or both of these fields
                               is true  and the viewer  request  includes  the
                               Accept-Encoding  header,  then  CloudFront does
                               the following:

                               o Normalizes  the  value  of  the  viewers  Ac-
                                 cept-Encoding header

                               o Includes  the  normalized header in the cache
                                 key

                               o Includes the normalized header in the request
                                 to the origin, if a request is necessary

                               For  more  information, see Compression support
                               in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                               If you set this value to true , and this  cache
                               behavior  also has an origin request policy at-
                               tached,  do  not  include  the  Accept-Encoding
                               header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                               always includes the Accept-Encoding  header  in
                               origin requests when the value of this field is
                               true , so including this header  in  an  origin
                               request policy has no effect.

                               If both of these fields are false , then Cloud-
                               Front treats  the  Accept-Encoding  header  the
                               same as any other HTTP header in the viewer re-
                               quest. By default,  its  not  included  in  the
                               cache  key  and  its not included in origin re-
                               quests. In this case, you can manually add  Ac-
                               cept-Encoding to the headers whitelist like any
                               other HTTP header.

                            EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                               A flag that can affect whether  the  Accept-En-

                            HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                               An  object  that  determines  whether  any HTTP
