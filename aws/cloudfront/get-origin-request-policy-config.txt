NAME
       get-origin-request-policy-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an origin request policy configuration.

       To  get  an  origin  request policy configuration, you must provide the
       policy's identifier. If the origin request policy is attached to a dis-
       tribution's  cache  behavior, you can get the policy's identifier using
       ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the origin request policy  is
       not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using Lis-
       tOriginRequestPolicies .

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the origin request policy. If  the  origin
          request  policy  is attached to a distribution's cache behavior, you
          can get the policy's identifier using ListDistributions  or  GetDis-
          tribution  . If the origin request policy is not attached to a cache
          behavior, you can get the identifier using ListOriginRequestPolicies
          .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)
