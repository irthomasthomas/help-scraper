SYNOPSIS
            get-streaming-distribution-config
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The streaming distribution's ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistributionConfig -> (structure)
          The streaming distribution's configuration information.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A  unique  value  (for  example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
              that the request can't be replayed.

              If the value of CallerReference is new (regardless of  the  con-
              tent of the StreamingDistributionConfig object), CloudFront cre-
              ates a new distribution.

              If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a  previ-
              ous  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a Dis-
              tributionAlreadyExists error.

          S3Origin -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  the  Amazon  S3
              bucket  from  which  you want CloudFront to get your media files
              for distribution.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

              OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                 The CloudFront origin access identity to associate  with  the
                 distribution.  Use an origin access identity to configure the
                 distribution so that end users can only access objects in  an
                 Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 If  you want end users to be able to access objects using ei-
                 ther the CloudFront URL or the  Amazon  S3  URL,  specify  an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To delete the origin access identity from an existing distri-
                 bution, update the distribution configuration and include  an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To  replace  the origin access identity, update the distribu-
                 tion configuration and specify the new  origin  access  iden-
                 tity.

                 For  more information, see Using an Origin Access Identity to
                 Restrict Access to Your  Amazon  S3  Content  in  the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Aliases -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate
              domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want  to  asso-
                 ciate with this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A  complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any, that
                 you want to associate with this distribution.

                 (string)

          Comment -> (string)
              Any comments you want to include about the  streaming  distribu-
              tion.

          Logging -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for
              the streaming distribution.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs  to
                 an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when
                 you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable
                 logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify false
                 for Enabled , and specify empty Bucket and  Prefix  elements.
                 If  you  specify false for Enabled but you specify values for
                 Bucket and Prefix , the values are automatically deleted.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in,  for  exam-
                 ple, amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An  optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to the
                 access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for ex-
                 ample,  myprefix/  .  If  you want to enable logging, but you
                 don't want to specify a prefix, you  still  must  include  an
                 empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

          TrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that specifies any Amazon Web Services accounts
              that you want to permit to create signed URLs for  private  con-
              tent.  If  you want the distribution to use signed URLs, include
              this element; if you want the distribution to use  public  URLs,
              remove  this  element. For more information, see Serving Private
              Content through CloudFront in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
              Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 in the list are configured as trusted signers. If  not,  this
                 field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                 (string)

          PriceClass -> (string)
              A  complex  type that contains information about price class for
              this streaming distribution.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Whether the streaming distribution is enabled to accept user re-
              quests for content.

       ETag -> (string)
