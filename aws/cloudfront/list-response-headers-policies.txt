LIST-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICIES()              LIST-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-response-headers-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of response headers policies.

       You can optionally apply a filter to get only the managed policies cre-
       ated by Amazon Web Services, or only the  custom  policies  created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to get only the specified kind of  response  headers  poli-
          cies. Valid values are:

          o managed  Gets only the managed policies created by Amazon Web Ser-
            vices.

          o custom  Gets only the custom policies created in your  Amazon  Web
            Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of response headers policies. The  response  includes  re-
          sponse  headers policies in the list that occur after the marker. To
          get the next page of the list, set this field's value to  the  value
          of NextMarker from the current page's response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of response headers policies that you want to get
          in the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                               this response headers policy.

                            SamplingRate -> (double)

                               Front to add the Server-Timing header to.  When
                               you  set  the  sampling rate to 100, CloudFront
                               adds the Server-Timing header to the  HTTP  re-
                               sponse for every request that matches the cache
                               behavior that this response headers  policy  is
                               attached  to. When you set it to 50, CloudFront
                               adds the header to 50% of the responses for re-
                               quests  that  match the cache behavior. You can
                               set the sampling rate to any number  0100  with
                               up to four decimal places.
