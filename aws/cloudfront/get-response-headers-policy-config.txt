NAME
       get-response-headers-policy-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a response headers policy configuration.

       To  get  a  response headers policy configuration, you must provide the
       policy's identifier. If the response headers policy is  attached  to  a
       distribution's  cache behavior, you can get the policy's identifier us-
       ing ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the response headers pol-
       icy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier us-
       ing ListResponseHeadersPolicies .

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier for the response headers policy.

          If the response headers policy is attached to a distribution's cache
          behavior,  you  can  get the policy's identifier using ListDistribu-
          tions or GetDistribution . If the response headers policy is not at-
          tached to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using ListRe-
          sponseHeadersPolicies .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
