CREATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                      CREATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a real-time log configuration.

       After  you  create  a real-time log configuration, you can attach it to
       one or more cache behaviors to send real-time log data to the specified
       Amazon Kinesis data stream.

       For  more information about real-time log configurations, see Real-time
       logs in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          are sending real-time log data.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where
              you are sending real-time log data in a real-time log configura-

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
                     Management (IAM) role that CloudFront  can  use  to  send

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StreamType": "string",
              "KinesisStreamConfig": {
                "RoleARN": "string",
                "StreamARN": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --fields (list)
          A list of fields to include in each real-time log record.

          For more information about fields, see Real-time  log  configuration
          fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --name (string)
          A unique name to identify this real-time log configuration.

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The  sampling  rate  for  this  real-time log configuration. You can
          specify a whole number between 1 and 100  (inclusive)  to  determine
          the  percentage  of  viewer  requests  that  are  represented in the
          real-time log data.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
