NAME
       delete-streaming-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Delete  a  streaming distribution. To delete an RTMP distribution using
       the CloudFront API, perform the following steps.
          To delete an RTMP distribution using the CloudFront API :

       o Disable the RTMP distribution.

       o Submit a GET Streaming Distribution Config request to get the current
         configuration and the Etag header for the distribution.

       o Update the XML document that was returned in the response to your GET
         Streaming Distribution Config request to change the value of  Enabled
         to false .

       o Submit a PUT Streaming Distribution Config request to update the con-
         figuration for your distribution. In the request  body,  include  the
         XML  document  that  you updated in Step 3. Then set the value of the
         HTTP If-Match header to the value of the ETag header that  CloudFront
         returned when you submitted the GET Streaming Distribution Config re-
         quest in Step 2.

       o Review the response to the PUT Streaming Distribution Config  request
         to confirm that the distribution was successfully disabled.

       o Submit  a  GET  Streaming Distribution Config request to confirm that
         your changes have propagated. When propagation is complete, the value
         of Status is Deployed .

       o Submit  a DELETE Streaming Distribution request. Set the value of the
         HTTP If-Match header to the value of the ETag header that  CloudFront
         returned when you submitted the GET Streaming Distribution Config re-
         quest in Step 2.

       o Review the response to your DELETE Streaming Distribution request  to
         confirm that the distribution was successfully deleted.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The distribution ID.

       --if-match (string)
          The value of the ETag header that you received when you disabled the
          streaming distribution. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
