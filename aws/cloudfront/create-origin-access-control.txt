CREATE-ORIGIN-ACCESS-CONTROL()                  CREATE-ORIGIN-ACCESS-CONTROL()



NAME
       create-origin-access-control -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new origin access control in CloudFront. After you create an
       origin access control, you can add it to an origin in a CloudFront dis-
       tribution  so  that CloudFront sends authenticated (signed) requests to
       the origin.

       This makes it possible to block public access to the  origin,  allowing
       viewers (users) to access the origin's content only through CloudFront.

       For  more  information  about using a CloudFront origin access control,
       see Restricting access to an Amazon Web Services origin in  the  Amazon
       CloudFront Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --origin-access-control-config (structure)
          Contains the origin access control.

          Name -> (string)
              A name to identify the origin access control. You can specify up
              to 64 characters.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the origin access control.

          SigningProtocol -> (string)
              The signing protocol of the origin access control, which  deter-
              mines  how  CloudFront  signs (authenticates) requests. The only
              valid value is sigv4 .

          SigningBehavior -> (string)
              Specifies which requests CloudFront signs  (adds  authentication
              information  to).  Specify  always for the most common use case.
              For more information, see origin access  control  advanced  set-
              tings in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              This field can have one of the following values:

              o always   CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwriting the
                Authorization header from the viewer request if one exists.

              o never  CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests. This value
                turns off origin access control for all origins in all distri-
                butions that use this origin access control.

              o no-override  If the viewer request doesn't contain the  Autho-
                rization  header, then CloudFront signs the origin request. If
                the viewer request contains  the  Authorization  header,  then
                CloudFront  doesn't sign the origin request and instead passes
                along the Authorization header from the viewer request.  WARN-
                ING:  To  pass  along  the  ``Authorization``  header from the
                viewer request, you *must* add the ``Authorization`` header to
                a   `cache   policy  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloud-
                Front/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`__
                for  all cache behaviors that use origins associated with this
                origin access control.

          OriginAccessControlOriginType -> (string)
              The type of origin that this origin access control is for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Description=string,SigningProtocol=string,SigningBehavior=string,OriginAccessControlOriginType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "Description": "string",
            "SigningProtocol": "sigv4",
            "SigningBehavior": "never"|"always"|"no-override",
            "OriginAccessControlOriginType": "s3"|"mediastore"|"mediapackagev2"|"lambda"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OriginAccessControl -> (structure)
          Contains an origin access control.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier of the origin access control.

          OriginAccessControlConfig -> (structure)
              The origin access control.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name to identify the origin access control. You can specify
                 up to 64 characters.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the origin access control.

              SigningProtocol -> (string)
                 The  signing protocol of the origin access control, which de-
                 termines how CloudFront signs (authenticates)  requests.  The
                 only valid value is sigv4 .

              SigningBehavior -> (string)
                 Specifies  which  requests CloudFront signs (adds authentica-
                 tion information to). Specify always for the most common  use
                 case.  For  more  information,  see origin access control ad-
                 vanced settings in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 This field can have one of the following values:

                 o always  CloudFront signs all origin  requests,  overwriting
                   the Authorization header from the viewer request if one ex-
                   ists.

                 o never  CloudFront doesn't sign any  origin  requests.  This
                   value  turns  off  origin access control for all origins in
                   all distributions that use this origin access control.

                 o no-override  If the viewer request doesn't contain the  Au-
                   thorization  header,  then  CloudFront signs the origin re-
                   quest. If the viewer  request  contains  the  Authorization
                   header, then CloudFront doesn't sign the origin request and
                   instead passes along  the  Authorization  header  from  the
                   viewer  request.  WARNING:  To  pass along the ``Authoriza-
                   tion`` header from the viewer request, you *must*  add  the
                   ``Authorization``     header    to    a    `cache    policy
                   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/Devel-
                   operGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html>`__  for all cache
                   behaviors that use origins associated with this origin  ac-
                   cess control.

              OriginAccessControlOriginType -> (string)
                 The type of origin that this origin access control is for.

       Location -> (string)
          The URL of the origin access control.

       ETag -> (string)
          The  version identifier for the current version of the origin access
          control.
