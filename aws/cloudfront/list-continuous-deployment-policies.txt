NAME
       list-continuous-deployment-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list  of the continuous deployment policies in your Amazon Web
       Services account.

       You can optionally specify the maximum number of items  to  receive  in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum that you specify, or the default maximum, the  response  is  pagi-
       nated.  To  get  the next page of items, send a subsequent request that
       specifies the NextMarker value from the current response as the  Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of continuous deployment policies. The  response  includes
          policies  in  the  list that occur after the marker. To get the next
          page of the list, set this fields value to the value  of  NextMarker
          from the current pages response.

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum  number of continuous deployment policies that you want
          returned in the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            tions.

                                   sending  some of a given user's requests to
                                   your staging distribution, while others are
                                   sent  to  your primary distribution. Define
                                   the session duration using TTL values.

                                   IdleTTL -> (integer)

                                      ceived. Allowed values are 3003600  sec-
                                      onds (560 minutes).

                                      MaximumTTL .

                                      of the same session. Allowed values  are
                                      3003600 seconds (560 minutes).

                                      The  value must be less than or equal to
                                      IdleTTL .

                            SingleHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                               Determines which HTTP requests are sent to  the
                               staging distribution.

                               Header -> (string)
                                   The  request  header  name  that  you  want
