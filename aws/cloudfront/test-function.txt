TEST-FUNCTION()                                                TEST-FUNCTION()



NAME
       test-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests a CloudFront function.

       To test a function, you provide an event object that represents an HTTP
       request or response that your CloudFront distribution could receive  in
       production.  CloudFront  runs the function, passing it the event object
       that you provided, and returns  the  function's  result  (the  modified
       event object) in the response. The response also contains function logs
       and error messages, if any exist. For more  information  about  testing
       functions,  see  Testing  functions  in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
       Guide .

       To test a function, you provide the function's name and  version  (ETag
       value) along with the event object. To get the function's name and ver-
       sion, you can use ListFunctions and DescribeFunction .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the function that you are testing.

       --if-match (string)
          The current version (ETag value) of the function that you are  test-
          ing, which you can get using DescribeFunction .

       --stage (string)
          The  stage  of the function that you are testing, either DEVELOPMENT
          or LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o DEVELOPMENT

          o LIVE

       --event-object (blob)
          The event object to test the function  with.  For  more  information
          about  the  structure  of the event object, see Testing functions in
          the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              of  35  means  that the function completed in 35% of the maximum
              allowed time.

          FunctionExecutionLogs -> (list)
              Contains the log lines that the function  wrote  (if  any)  when
