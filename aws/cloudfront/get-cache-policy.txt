GET-CACHE-POLICY()                                          GET-CACHE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-cache-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a cache policy, including the following metadata:

       o The policy's identifier.

       o The date and time when the policy was last modified.

       To get a cache policy, you must provide the policy's identifier. If the
       cache policy is attached to a distribution's cache  behavior,  you  can
       get  the policy's identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistribution
       . If the cache policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can  get
       the identifier using ListCachePolicies .

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the cache policy. If the cache policy is
          attached to a distribution's cache behavior, you can  get  the  pol-
          icy's identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the
          cache policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you  can  get  the
          identifier using ListCachePolicies .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       CachePolicy -> (structure)
          The cache policy.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the cache policy.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the cache policy was last modified.

          CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
              The cache policy configuration.

              Comment -> (string)
                 A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be
                 longer than 128 characters.

              Name -> (string)
                 A unique name to identify the cache policy.

              DefaultTTL -> (long)
                 The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront  sends  an-
                 other request to the origin to see if the object has been up-
                 dated. CloudFront uses this value as  the  object's  time  to
                 live  (TTL)  only when the origin does not send Cache-Control
                 or Expires headers with the object. For more information, see
                 Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one  day).
                 If  the  value of MinTTL is more than 86400 seconds, then the
                 default value for this field is the  same  as  the  value  of
                 MinTTL .

              MaxTTL -> (long)
                 The  maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in
                 the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another  request
                 to  the  origin to see if the object has been updated. Cloud-
                 Front uses this value only when the origin  sends  Cache-Con-
                 trol  or  Expires  headers with the object. For more informa-
                 tion, see Managing How Long Content Stays in  an  Edge  Cache
                 (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The  default  value  for  this field is 31536000 seconds (one
                 year). If the value of MinTTL  or  DefaultTTL  is  more  than
                 31536000  seconds,  then  the default value for this field is
                 the same as the value of DefaultTTL .

              MinTTL -> (long)
                 The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to  stay  in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends an-
                 other request to the origin to see if the object has been up-
                 dated.  For  more  information, see Managing How Long Content
                 Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon  CloudFront
                 Developer Guide .

              ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin -> (structure)
                 The  HTTP  headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include
                 in the cache key. The values included in the  cache  key  are
                 automatically  included  in requests that CloudFront sends to
                 the origin.

                 EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                     A flag that can affect whether the  Accept-Encoding  HTTP
                     header  is  included in the cache key and included in re-
                     quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     This field is related to  the  EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli
                     field.  If  one  or both of these fields is true  and the
                     viewer request includes the Accept-Encoding header,  then
                     CloudFront does the following:

                     o Normalizes  the  value  of the viewer's Accept-Encoding
                       header

                     o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     o Includes the normalized header in the  request  to  the
                       origin, if a request is necessary

                     For more information, see Compression support in the Ama-
                     zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If you set this value to true , and this  cache  behavior
                     also  has  an  origin request policy attached, do not in-
                     clude the Accept-Encoding header in  the  origin  request
                     policy.  CloudFront  always  includes the Accept-Encoding
                     header in origin requests when the value of this field is
                     true , so including this header in an origin request pol-
                     icy has no effect.

                     If both of these  fields  are  false  ,  then  CloudFront
                     treats  the  Accept-Encoding header the same as any other
                     HTTP header in the viewer request. By default,  it's  not
                     included in the cache key and it's not included in origin
                     requests. In this case, you can manually  add  Accept-En-
                     coding  to  the  headers  whitelist  like  any other HTTP
                     header.

                 EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                     A flag that can affect whether the  Accept-Encoding  HTTP
                     header  is  included in the cache key and included in re-
                     quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     This field is  related  to  the  EnableAcceptEncodingGzip
                     field.  If  one  or both of these fields is true  and the
                     viewer request includes the Accept-Encoding header,  then
                     CloudFront does the following:

                     o Normalizes  the  value  of the viewer's Accept-Encoding
                       header

                     o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     o Includes the normalized header in the  request  to  the
                       origin, if a request is necessary

                     also  has  an  origin request policy attached, do not in-
                     clude the Accept-Encoding header in  the  origin  request

                 HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                     An object that determines whether any HTTP  headers  (and
                     if  so,  which headers) are included in the cache key and
                     automatically included in requests that CloudFront  sends
                     to the origin.

                     HeaderBehavior -> (string)
                        Determines  whether  any  HTTP headers are included in
                        the cache key and automatically included  in  requests
                        that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

                          and are not automatically included in requests  that
                          CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field
                          is set to none , any headers that are listed  in  an
                          OriginRequestPolicy   are  included  in  origin  re-
                          quests.

                 CookiesConfig -> (structure)
                     An  object  that determines whether any cookies in viewer
                     requests (and if so, which cookies) are included  in  the
                     cache  key  and  automatically  included in requests that

                        cache key and automatically included in requests  that
                        CloudFront  sends  to the origin. The behavior depends
                        on  whether  the  QueryStringBehavior  field  in   the
                        CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig type is set to whitelist
                        (the listed query strings * are * included) or  allEx-
                        cept  (the  listed query strings * are not * included,
                        but all other query strings are).
