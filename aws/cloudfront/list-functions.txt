LIST-FUNCTIONS()                                              LIST-FUNCTIONS()



NAME
       list-functions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of all CloudFront functions in your Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       You can optionally apply a filter to return only the functions that are
       in the specified stage, either DEVELOPMENT or LIVE .

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your  list of functions. The response includes functions in the list
          that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the  list,  set
          this  field's  value  to  the  value  of NextMarker from the current
          page's response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of functions that you want in the response.

       --stage (string)
          An optional filter to return only the  functions  that  are  in  the
          specified stage, either DEVELOPMENT or LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o DEVELOPMENT

          o LIVE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FunctionList -> (structure)
          A list of CloudFront functions.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing functions where you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of functions requested.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of functions returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the functions in the list.

              (structure)
                 Contains  configuration  information  and  metadata  about  a
                 CloudFront function.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudFront function.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the CloudFront function.

                 FunctionConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains configuration  information  about  a  CloudFront
                     function.

                     Comment -> (string)
                        A comment to describe the function.

                     Runtime -> (string)
                        The function's runtime environment verion.

                 FunctionMetadata -> (structure)
                     Contains metadata about a CloudFront function.

                     FunctionARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the function. The
                        ARN uniquely identifies the function.

                     Stage -> (string)
                        The stage that the function is in, either  DEVELOPMENT
                        or LIVE .

                        When  a  function is in the DEVELOPMENT stage, you can
                        test the function with TestFunction ,  and  update  it
                        with UpdateFunction .

                        When  a  function is in the LIVE stage, you can attach
                        the function to a distribution's cache behavior, using
                        the function's ARN.

                        The date and time when the function was created.

                     LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date and time when the function was most recently
                        updated.
