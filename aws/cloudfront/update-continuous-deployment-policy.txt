NAME
       update-continuous-deployment-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a continuous deployment policy. You can update a continuous de-
       ployment policy to enable or disable it, to change  the  percentage  of
       traffic  that  it  sends  to the staging distribution, or to change the
       staging distribution that it sends traffic to.

       When you update a continuous deployment policy configuration,  all  the
       fields  are  updated  with the values that are provided in the request.
       You cannot update some fields independent of others. To update  a  con-
       tinuous deployment policy configuration:

       o Use GetContinuousDeploymentPolicyConfig to get the current configura-
         tion.

       o Locally modify the fields in the continuous deployment policy config-
         uration that you want to update.

       o Use  UpdateContinuousDeploymentPolicy , providing the entire continu-
         ous deployment policy configuration, including the  fields  that  you
         modified and those that you didn't.

OPTIONS
       --continuous-deployment-policy-config (structure)
          The continuous deployment policy configuration.

          StagingDistributionDnsNames -> (structure)
              The  CloudFront domain name of the staging distribution. For ex-
              ample: d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of CloudFront domain names in your staging distri-
                 bution.

              Items -> (list)
                 The CloudFront domain name of the staging distribution.

                 (string)

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              A Boolean that indicates whether this continuous deployment pol-
              icy is enabled (in effect). When this value is true , this  pol-
              icy  is  enabled  and in effect. When this value is false , this
              policy is not enabled and has no effect.

          TrafficConfig -> (structure)
              Contains the parameters for routing production traffic from your
              primary to staging distributions.

              SingleWeightConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains  the  percentage  of  traffic to send to the staging
                 distribution.

                 Weight -> (float)
                     The percentage of traffic to send to a staging  distribu-
                     tion,  expressed  as a decimal number between 0 and 0.15.
                     For example, a value of 0.10 means 10% of traffic is sent
                     to the staging distribution.

                 SessionStickinessConfig -> (structure)
                     Session  stickiness provides the ability to define multi-
                     ple requests from a single viewer as  a  single  session.
                     This  prevents the potentially inconsistent experience of
                     sending some of a given user's requests to  your  staging
                     distribution,  while others are sent to your primary dis-
                     tribution. Define the session duration using TTL values.

                     IdleTTL -> (integer)
                        The amount of time after which you  want  sessions  to
                        cease  if no requests are received. Allowed values are
                        3003600 seconds (560 minutes).

                        The value must be less than or equal to MaximumTTL .

                     MaximumTTL -> (integer)
                        The maximum amount of time to consider  requests  from
                        the  viewer as being part of the same session. Allowed
                        values are 3003600 seconds (560 minutes).

                        The value must be greater than or equal to IdleTTL .

              SingleHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Determines which HTTP requests are sent to the  staging  dis-
                 tribution.

                 Header -> (string)
                     The  request header name that you want CloudFront to send
                     to your staging distribution. The header must contain the
                     prefix aws-cf-cd- .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The request header value.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of traffic configuration.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StagingDistributionDnsNames": {
              "Quantity": integer,
              "Items": ["string", ...]
            },
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "TrafficConfig": {
              "SingleWeightConfig": {
                "Weight": float,

                "Header": "string",
                "Value": "string"
              },
              "Type": "SingleWeight"|"SingleHeader"
            }
          }

       --id (string)
          The  identifier of the continuous deployment policy that you are up-
          dating.

       --if-match (string)
          The current version (ETag value) of the continuous deployment policy
          that you are updating.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
