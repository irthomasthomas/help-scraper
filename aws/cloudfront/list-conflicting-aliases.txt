LIST-CONFLICTING-ALIASES()                          LIST-CONFLICTING-ALIASES()



NAME
       list-conflicting-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of aliases (also called CNAMEs or alternate domain names)
       that conflict or overlap with the provided alias,  and  the  associated
       CloudFront distributions and Amazon Web Services accounts for each con-
       flicting alias. In the returned list, the distribution and account  IDs
       are  partially  hidden,  which allows you to identify the distributions
       and accounts that you own, but helps to protect the information of ones
       that you don't own.

       Use  this  operation to find aliases that are in use in CloudFront that
       conflict or overlap with the provided alias. For example, if  you  pro-
       vide  www.example.com as input, the returned list can include www.exam-
       ple.com and the overlapping wildcard  alternate  domain  name  (*.exam-
       ple.com  ),  if  they exist. If you provide *.example.com as input, the
       returned list can include *.example.com and any alternate domain  names
       covered  by  that  wildcard  (for example, www.example.com , test.exam-
       ple.com , dev.example.com , and so on), if they exist.

       To list conflicting aliases, you provide the alias to search and the ID
       of a distribution in your account that has an attached SSL/TLS certifi-
       cate that includes the provided alias. For more information,  including
       how to set up the distribution and certificate, see Moving an alternate
       domain name to a different distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
       oper Guide .

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --distribution-id (string)
          The ID of a distribution  in  your  account  that  has  an  attached
          SSL/TLS certificate that includes the provided alias.

       --alias (string)
          The alias (also called a CNAME) to search for conflicting aliases.

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          the list of conflicting aliases. The response  includes  conflicting
          aliases  in  the  list  that occur after the marker. To get the next
          page of the list, set this field's value to the value of  NextMarker
          from the current page's response.

       --max-items (integer)
          The  maximum  number of conflicting aliases that you want in the re-
          sponse.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ConflictingAliasesList -> (structure)
          A list of conflicting aliases.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing conflicting aliases where you left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of conflicting aliases requested.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of conflicting aliases returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the conflicting aliases in the list.

              (structure)
                 An  alias  (also called a CNAME) and the CloudFront distribu-
                 tion and Amazon Web Services account ID that it's  associated
                 with.  The distribution and account IDs are partially hidden,
                 which allows you to identify the distributions  and  accounts
                 that  you  own,  but helps to protect the information of ones
                 that you don't own.

                     An alias (also called a CNAME).

                 DistributionId -> (string)
                     The (partially hidden) ID of the CloudFront  distribution
                     associated with the alias.

                 AccountId -> (string)
                     The  (partially hidden) ID of the Amazon Web Services ac-
                     count that owns the distribution that's  associated  with
                     the alias.
