NAME
       list-origin-access-controls -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  list of CloudFront origin access controls in this Amazon Web
       Services account.

       You can optionally specify the maximum number of items  to  receive  in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum that you specify, or the default maximum, the  response  is  pagi-
       nated.  To get the next page of items, send another request that speci-
       fies the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker value
       in the next request.

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of origin access controls. The response includes the items
          in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next page of the
          list, set this field's value to the value  of  NextMarker  from  the
          current page's response.

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum  number  of origin access controls that you want in the
          response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       OriginAccessControlList -> (structure)
          A list of origin access controls.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value of the Marker field that was provided in the request.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If  there  are more items in the list than are in this response,
              this element is present. It contains the value  to  use  in  the
              Marker  field  of another request to continue listing origin ac-
              cess controls.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of origin access controls requested.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this value is true .

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of origin access controls returned in the response.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the origin access controls in the list.

              (structure)
                 A CloudFront origin access control.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The unique identifier of the origin access control.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description of the origin access control.

                 Name -> (string)
                     A unique name that identifies the origin access control.

                 SigningProtocol -> (string)
                     The  signing  protocol  of the origin access control. The
                     signing protocol determines how CloudFront signs (authen-
                     ticates) requests. The only valid value is sigv4 .

                 SigningBehavior -> (string)
                     A  value  that  specifies which requests CloudFront signs
                     (adds authentication information to). This field can have
                     one of the following values:

                     o never  CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests.

                     o always  CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwrit-
                       ing the Authorization header from the viewer request if
                       necessary.

                     o no-override   If the viewer request doesn't contain the
                       Authorization header, CloudFront signs the  origin  re-
                       quest. If the viewer request contains the Authorization
                       header, CloudFront doesn't sign the origin request, but
                       instead  passes  along the Authorization header that it
                       received in the viewer request.

                 OriginAccessControlOriginType -> (string)
                     The type of origin that this  origin  access  control  is
                     for. The only valid value is s3 .
