LIST-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIGS()                        LIST-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-realtime-log-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of real-time log configurations.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of real-time log configurations that you want  in
          the response.

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of real-time log  configurations.  The  response  includes
          real-time  log  configurations  in  the  list  that  occur after the
          marker. To get the next page of the list, set this fields  value  to
          the value of NextMarker from the current pages response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              this element is present. It contains the value that  you  should
              use  in  the  Marker  field  of a subsequent request to continue
              listing real-time log configurations where you left off.
