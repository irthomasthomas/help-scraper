GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                            GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a real-time log configuration.

       To  get  a  real-time log configuration, you can provide the configura-
       tions name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least
       one.  If  you  provide  both,  CloudFront uses the name to identify the
       real-time log configuration to get.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

          [--name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the real-time log configuration to get.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration to
          get.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              figuration.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about the  Amazon  Kinesis  data  stream
                 where  you  are sending real-time log data in a real-time log
                 configuration.

                 StreamType -> (string)
                     The type of data stream where you are  sending  real-time
                     log data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

                 KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

                     RoleARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and  Ac-
                        cess  Management (IAM) role that CloudFront can use to
                        send real-time log data to your Kinesis data stream.

                        For more information the IAM role, see  Real-time  log
                        configuration IAM role in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                     StreamARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Kinesis  data

          Fields -> (list)
              A list of fields that are included in each real-time log record.
              In an API response, the fields are provided in the same order in
              which they are sent to the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

              For  more information about fields, see Real-time log configura-
              tion fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .
