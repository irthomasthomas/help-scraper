OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account the import job was exe-
          cuted in.

       --asset-bundle-import-job-id (string)
          The ID of the job. The job ID is set when you start a new job with a
          StartAssetBundleImportJob API call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                            role.  The  administrator  can then use RoleArn to
                            bypass the account-wide role and allow Athena  ac-
                            cess  for  the  single  Athena data source that is

                            count-wide  role forbidding Athena access is still

                            and Port are provided.

                        IAMParameters -> (structure)
                            An optional parameter that uses IAM authentication
                            to grant Amazon QuickSight access to your cluster.
                            This   parameter   can   be   used   instead    of
                            DataSourceCredentials .

                            RoleArn -> (string)
                               Use  the  RoleArn  structure  to  allow  Amazon
                               QuickSight to  call  redshift:GetClusterCreden-
                               tials  on  your  cluster. The calling principal
                               must have iam:PassRole access to pass the  role
                               to  Amazon  QuickSight. The role's trust policy
                               must allow the Amazon QuickSight service  prin-
                               cipal to assume the role.

                            DatabaseUser -> (string)
                               The  user  whose  permissions and group member-
                               ships will be used by Amazon QuickSight to  ac-
                               cess  the  cluster. If this user already exists
                               in your database, Amazon QuickSight is  granted
                               the  same permissions that the user has. If the
                               user doesn't exist, set the value  of  AutoCre-
                               ateDatabaseUser  to  True  to create a new user
                               with PUBLIC permissions.

                            DatabaseGroups -> (list)

                               granted  to  Amazon  QuickSight  to  access the
                               cluster. These permissions  are  combined  with
                               the permissions granted to Amazon QuickSight by
                               the DatabaseUser . If  you  choose  to  include
                               this  parameter,  the RoleArn must grant access
                               to redshift:JoinGroup .

                               (string)

                            AutoCreateDatabaseUser -> (boolean)
                               Automatically creates a database user. If  your
                               database doesn't have a DatabaseUser , set this
                               parameter to True . If there is no DatabaseUser
                               , Amazon QuickSight can't connect to your clus-
                               ter. The RoleArn that you use for  this  opera-
                               tion  must grant access to redshift:CreateClus-
                               terUser to successfully create the user.

                            NULL if the manifest file was uploaded into Amazon
                            QuickSight.

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            Use the  RoleArn  structure  to  override  an  ac-
                            count-wide role for a specific S3 data source. For
                            example, say an account administrator  has  turned
                            off  all  S3 access with an account-wide role. The
                            administrator can then use RoleArn to  bypass  the
                            account-wide role and allow S3 access for the sin-
                            gle S3 data source that is specified in the struc-
                            ture,  even if the account-wide role forbidding S3
                            access is still active.
