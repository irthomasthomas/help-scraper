SEARCH-DATA-SETS()                                          SEARCH-DATA-SETS()



NAME
       search-data-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  the SearchDataSets operation to search for datasets that belong to
       an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-data-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DataSetSummaries

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID.

       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the search.

          (structure)
              A filter that you apply when searching for datasets.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example  "Operator":  "StringEquals"  .  Valid   values   are
                 "StringEquals" and "StringLike" .

                 If you set the operator value to "StringEquals" , you need to
                 provide an ownership related filter in the "NAME"  field  and
                 the  arn  of  the  user  or  group whose datasets you want to
                 search in the  "Value"  field.  For  example,  "Name":"QUICK-
                 SIGHT_OWNER",     "Operator":     "StringEquals",    "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east- 1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

                 If you set the value to "StringLike" , you  need  to  provide
                 the  name of the datasets you are searching for. For example,
                 "Name":"DATASET_NAME",  "Operator":  "StringLike",   "Value":
                 "Test"  .  The  "StringLike"  operator only supports the NAME
                 value DATASET_NAME .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example, "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_OWNER" .

                 Valid values are defined as follows:

                 o QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER  :  Provide  an ARN of a user or
                   group, and any datasets with that ARN listed as one of  the
                   dataset  owners  or  viewers are returned. Implicit permis-
                   sions from folders or groups are considered.

                 o QUICKSIGHT_OWNER : Provide an ARN of a user or  group,  and
                   any  datasets  with that ARN listed as one of the owners of
                   the dataset are returned. Implicit permissions from folders
                   or groups are considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER  : Provide an ARN of a user or
                   group, and any datasets with that ARN listed  as  the  only
                   owner  of  the  dataset  are returned. Implicit permissions
                   from folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER : Provide  an  ARN  of  a  user  or
                   group,  and any datasets with that ARN listed as one of the
                   owners if the dataset are  returned.  Implicit  permissions
                   from folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER  :  Provide  an  ARN of a
                   user or group, and any datasets with that ARN listed as one
                   of  the  owners or viewers of the dataset are returned. Im-
                   plicit permissions from folders or groups are  not  consid-
                   ered.

                 o DATASET_NAME  :  Any  datasets whose names have a substring
                   match to this value will be returned.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the named item, in this case QUICKSIGHT_OWNER  ,
                 that  you  want  to  use  as  a filter, for example, "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals"|"StringLike",
              "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER"|"DATASET_NAME",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
