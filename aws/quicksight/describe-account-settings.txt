OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that  contains  the  set-
          tings that you want to list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          sometimes  referred  to  as  a QuickSight "account" even though it's
          technically not an account by itself. Instead, it's  a  subscription
          to  the  Amazon  QuickSight service for your Amazon Web Services ac-

              scription in your Amazon Web Services account. You  create  this
              name when you sign up for Amazon QuickSight. It is unique in all
              of Amazon Web Services and it appears only when users sign in.

          Edition -> (string)
              The edition of Amazon  QuickSight  that  you're  currently  sub-

              tries to make a DeleteAccountSubsctiption request. A False value
              will allow the ccount to be deleted.
