NAME
       create-iam-policy-assignment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an assignment with one specified IAM policy, identified by its
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This policy assignment is attached  to  the
       specified  groups  or  users of Amazon QuickSight. Assignment names are
       unique per Amazon Web Services account. To avoid overwriting  rules  in
       other namespaces, use assignment names that are unique.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace that contains the assignment.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
