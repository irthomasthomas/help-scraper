OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains the folder.

       --filters (list)
          The  filters  to apply to the search. Currently, you can search only
          by the parent folder ARN. For example, "Filters": [ { "Name":  "PAR-
          ENT_FOLDER_ARN",      "Operator":      "StringEquals",      "Value":
          "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:folder/folderId" } ] .

          (structure)
              A filter to use to search a Amazon QuickSight folder.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use in  the  filter.
                 For example, "Operator": "StringEquals" .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of a value that you want to use in the filter. For
                 example, "Name": "PARENT_FOLDER_ARN" .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  named  item  (in  this   example,   PAR-
                 ENT_FOLDER_ARN ), that you want to use as a filter. For exam-
                 ple,                 "Value":                 "arn:aws:quick-
                 sight:us-east-1:1:folder/folderId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals",
              "Name": "PARENT_FOLDER_ARN",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
