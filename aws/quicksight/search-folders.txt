OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains the folder.

       --filters (list)
          The  filters  to apply to the search. Currently, you can search only
          by the parent folder ARN. For example, "Filters": [ { "Name":  "PAR-
          ENT_FOLDER_ARN",      "Operator":      "StringEquals",      "Value":
          "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:folder/folderId" } ] .

          (structure)
              A filter to use to search an Amazon QuickSight folder.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example   "Operator":   "StringEquals"  .  Valid  values  are
                 "StringEquals" and "StringLike" .

                 If you set the operator value to "StringEquals" , you need to
                 provide  an  ownership related filter in the "NAME" field and
                 the arn of the user or group whose folders you want to search
                 in  the  "Value"  field.  For  example, "Name":"DIRECT_QUICK-
                 SIGHT_OWNER",    "Operator":     "StringEquals",     "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

                 If  you  set  the value to "StringLike" , you need to provide
                 the name of the folders you are searching for.  For  example,
                 "Name":"FOLDER_NAME",   "Operator":   "StringLike",  "Value":
                 "Test" . The "StringLike" operator  only  supports  the  NAME
                 value FOLDER_NAME .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of a value that you want to use in the filter. For
                 example, "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_OWNER" .

                 Valid values are defined as follows:

                 o QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER : Provide an ARN of  a  user  or
                   group,  and  any folders with that ARN listed as one of the
                   folder's owners or viewers are returned.  Implicit  permis-
                   sions from folders or groups are considered.

                 o QUICKSIGHT_OWNER  :  Provide an ARN of a user or group, and
                   any folders with that ARN listed as one of  the  owners  of
                   the folders are returned. Implicit permissions from folders
                   or groups are considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER : Provide an ARN of a user  or
                   group,  and  any  folders  with that ARN listed as the only
                   owner of the folder are returned. Implicit permissions from
                   folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER  :  Provide  an  ARN  of  a user or
                   group, and any folders with that ARN listed as one  of  the
                   owners  of  the  folders are returned. Implicit permissions
                   from folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER : Provide  an  ARN  of  a
                   user  or group, and any folders with that ARN listed as one
                   of the owners or viewers of the folders are  returned.  Im-
                   plicit  permissions  from folders or groups are not consid-
                   ered.

                 o FOLDER_NAME : Any folders  whose  names  have  a  substring
                   match to this value will be returned.

                 o PARENT_FOLDER_ARN  :  Provide  an  ARN of a folder, and any
                   folders that are directly under that parent folder are  re-
                   turned.  If  you  choose  to  use this option and leave the
                   value blank, all root-level folders in the account are  re-
                   turned.

              Value -> (string)
                 The   value   of  the  named  item  (in  this  example,  PAR-
                 ENT_FOLDER_ARN ), that you want to use as a filter. For exam-
                 ple,                 "Value":                 "arn:aws:quick-
                 sight:us-east-1:1:folder/folderId" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals"|"StringLike",
              "Name": "PARENT_FOLDER_ARN"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"FOLDER_NAME",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
