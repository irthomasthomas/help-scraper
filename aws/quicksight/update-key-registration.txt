OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that contains the customer
          managed key registration that you want to update.

       --key-registration (list)
          A list of RegisteredCustomerManagedKey objects to be updated to  the
          Amazon QuickSight account.

          (structure)
              A  customer  managed key structure that contains the information
              listed below:

              o KeyArn - The ARN of a KMS key that is registered to  a  Amazon
                QuickSight account for encryption and decryption use.

              o DefaultKey  -  Indicates whether the current key is set as the
                default key for encryption and decryption use.

              KeyArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the KMS key that is registered to a Amazon  Quick-
                 Sight account for encryption and decryption use.

              DefaultKey -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  a  RegisteredCustomerManagedKey is set as
                 the default key for encryption and decryption use.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyArn=string,DefaultKey=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "KeyArn": "string",
              "DefaultKey": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
