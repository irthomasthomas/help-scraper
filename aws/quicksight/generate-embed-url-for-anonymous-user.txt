NAME
       generate-embed-url-for-anonymous-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
       dashboard or visual in your website, without  having  to  register  any
       reader  users. Before you use this action, make sure that you have con-
       figured the dashboards and permissions.

       The following rules apply to the generated URL:

       o It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
         it  is  generated.  Once  redeemed  within  this period, it cannot be
         re-used again.

       o The URL validity period should not be confused with the  actual  ses-
         sion    lifetime    that    can    be   customized   using   the   ``
         SessionLifetimeInMinutes `` parameter. The resulting user session  is
         valid  for  15  minutes  (minimum) to 10 hours (maximum). The default
         session duration is 10 hours.

       o You are charged only when the URL is used  or  there  is  interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       For  more  information, see Embedded Analytics in the Amazon QuickSight
       User Guide .

       For more information about the high-level steps for embedding  and  for
       an  interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the
       Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal .

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains  the  dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How  many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be
          in [15-600] minutes range.

       --namespace (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight namespace that the  anonymous  user  virtually
          belongs  to.  If you are not using an Amazon QuickSight custom name-
          space, set this to default .

       --session-tags (list)
          The session tags used for row-level security. Before  you  use  this
          parameter,  make sure that you have configured the relevant datasets
          using the  DataSet$RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration  parameter  so
          that session tags can be used to provide row-level security.

          These  are  not  the  tags used for the Amazon Web Services resource
          tagging feature. For more information, see Using Row-Level  Security
          (RLS) with Tags in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

          (structure)
              The key-value pair used for the row-level security tags feature.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value that you want to assign the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --authorized-resource-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the Amazon QuickSight resources
          that the user is authorized to access during  the  lifetime  of  the
          session.

          If you choose Dashboard embedding experience, pass the list of dash-
          board ARNs in the account that you want the user to be able to view.

          If you want to make changes to the theme of your  embedded  content,
          pass a list of theme ARNs that the anonymous users need access to.

          Currently, you can pass up to 25 theme ARNs in each API call.

                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this dashboard must be in-
                 cluded in the  AuthorizedResourceArns  parameter.  Otherwise,

                 This  ID  is  included in the output URL. When the URL in re-
                 sponse is accessed, Amazon QuickSight renders this visual.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dashboard that the vis-
                 ual belongs to must be included in the AuthorizedResourceArns

                 want the anonymous user to see first. This ID is included  in
                 the  output URL. When the URL in response is accessed, Amazon
                 QuickSight renders the Q search bar with  this  legacy  topic

       --allowed-domains (list)
          The domains that you want to add to the allow list for access to the
          generated  URL  that is then embedded. This optional parameter over-
          rides the static domains that are configured in  the  Manage  Quick-
          Sight menu in the Amazon QuickSight console. Instead, it allows only
          the domains that you include in this parameter. You can list  up  to
          three domains or subdomains in each API call.

          To include all subdomains under a specific domain to the allow list,
          use * . For example, https://*.sapp.amazon.com includes  all  subdo-
          mains under https://sapp.amazon.com .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
