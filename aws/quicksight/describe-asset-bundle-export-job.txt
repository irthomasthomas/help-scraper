NAME
       describe-asset-bundle-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing export job.

       Poll job descriptions after a job starts to know the status of the job.
       When a job succeeds, a URL is provided to download the exported assets'
       data from. Download URLs are valid for five minutes after they are gen-
       erated. You can call the DescribeAssetBundleExportJob  API  for  a  new
       download URL as needed.

       Job descriptions are available for 14 days after the job starts.

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account the export job is executed
          in.

       --asset-bundle-export-job-id (string)
          The ID of the job that you want described. The job ID  is  set  when
          you start a new job with a StartAssetBundleExportJob API call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       JobStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the status of a job through its queuing and execution.

       DownloadUrl -> (string)
          The URL to download the exported asset bundle data from.

          This  URL is available only after the job has succeeded. This URL is

          portJob again for a fresh URL if needed.

          The  downloaded  asset  bundle  is a zip file named assetbundle-{jo-
          bId}.qs . The file has a .qs extension.
