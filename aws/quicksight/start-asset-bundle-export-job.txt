START-ASSET-BUNDLE-EXPORT-JOB()                START-ASSET-BUNDLE-EXPORT-JOB()



NAME
       start-asset-bundle-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts an Asset Bundle export job.

       An  Asset Bundle export job exports specified Amazon QuickSight assets.
       You can also choose to export any asset dependencies in the  same  job.
       Export  jobs run asynchronously and can be polled with a DescribeAsset-
       BundleExportJob API call. When a job is successfully completed, a down-
       load  URL  that  contains  the  exported assets is returned. The URL is
       valid for 5 minutes and can be refreshed with a  DescribeAssetBundleEx-
       portJob API call. Each Amazon QuickSight account can run up to 5 export
       jobs concurrently.

       The API caller must have the necessary permissions in their IAM role to
       access each resource before the resources can be exported.

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account to export assets from.

       --asset-bundle-export-job-id (string)
          The ID of the job. This ID is unique while the job is running. After
          the job is completed, you can reuse this ID for another job.

       --resource-arns (list)
          An array of resource ARNs to export.  The  following  resources  are
          supported.

          o Analysis

          o Dashboard

          o DataSet

          o DataSource

          o RefreshSchedule

          o Theme

          o VPCConnection

          The API caller must have the necessary permissions in their IAM role
          to access each resource before the resources can be exported.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --include-all-dependencies | --no-include-all-dependencies (boolean)
          A Boolean that determines whether all dependencies of each  resource
          ARN are recursively exported with the job. For example, say you pro-
          vided a Dashboard ARN to the ResourceArns parameter. If you set  In-
          cludeAllDependencies  to  TRUE , any theme, dataset, and data source
          resource that is a dependency of the dashboard is also exported.

       --export-format (string)
          The export data format.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFORMATION_JSON

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the export job.

       AssetBundleExportJobId -> (string)
          The ID of the job. This ID is unique while the job is running. After
          the job is completed, you can reuse this ID for another job.
