DELETE-ANALYSIS()                                            DELETE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       delete-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include
       a recovery window during which you can restore  the  analysis.  If  you
       don't  specify  a  recovery  window value, the operation defaults to 30
       days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a DeletionTime stamp to  the  response
       that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recov-
       ery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.

       At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the  RestoreAnaly-
       sis API operation to remove the DeletionTime stamp and cancel the dele-
       tion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible  in  the  API  until
       it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from
       it.

       An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the  Ama-
       zon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Delet-
       ing an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account where you want  to  delete
          an analysis.

       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis that you're deleting.

       --recovery-window-in-days (long)
          A  value  that  specifies  the number of days that Amazon QuickSight
          waits before it deletes the analysis. You can't use  this  parameter
          with the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery option in the same API call. The
          default value is 30.

       --force-delete-without-recovery  |   --no-force-delete-without-recovery
       (boolean)
          This  option defaults to the value NoForceDeleteWithoutRecovery . To
          immediately delete the analysis, add the  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery
          option. You can't restore an analysis after it's deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          The HTTP status of the request.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the deleted analysis.

       AnalysisId -> (string)
          The ID of the deleted analysis.

       DeletionTime -> (timestamp)
