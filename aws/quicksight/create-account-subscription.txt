CREATE-ACCOUNT-SUBSCRIPTION()                    CREATE-ACCOUNT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-account-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon  QuickSight account, or subscribes to Amazon Quick-
       Sight Q.

       The Amazon Web Services Region for the account is derived from what  is
       configured  in the CLI or SDK. This operation isn't supported in the US
       East (Ohio) Region, South America (Sao Paulo) Region, or  Asia  Pacific
       (Singapore) Region.

       Before you use this operation, make sure that you can connect to an ex-
       isting Amazon Web Services account. If you don't  have  an  Amazon  Web
       Services  account,  see  Sign  up for Amazon Web Services in the Amazon
       QuickSight User Guide . The person who signs up for  Amazon  QuickSight
       needs  to have the correct Identity and Access Management (IAM) permis-
       sions. For more information, see IAM Policy Examples for Amazon  Quick-
       Sight in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

       If  your  IAM  policy includes both the Subscribe and CreateAccountSub-
       scription actions, make sure that both actions are set to  Allow  .  If
       either  action  is  set to Deny , the Deny action prevails and your API
       call fails.

       You can't pass an existing IAM role to access other Amazon Web Services
       services  using  this  API operation. To pass your existing IAM role to
       Amazon QuickSight, see Passing IAM roles to Amazon  QuickSight  in  the
       Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

       You  can't set default resource access on the new account from the Ama-
       zon QuickSight API. Instead, add default resource access from the  Ama-
       zon  QuickSight console. For more information about setting default re-
       source access to Amazon Web Services services, see Setting default  re-
       source  access to Amazon Web Services services in the Amazon QuickSight
       User Guide .
