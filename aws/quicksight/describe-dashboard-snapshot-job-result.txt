NAME
       describe-dashboard-snapshot-job-result -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the result of an existing snapshot job that has finished run-
       ning.

       A finished snapshot job will return a COMPLETED or FAILED  status  when
       you poll the job with a DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob API call.

       If  the  job has not finished running, this operation returns a message
       that says Dashboard  Snapshot  Job  with  id  <SnapshotjobId>  has  not
       reached a terminal state. .

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services account that the dashboard snap-
          shot job is executed in.

       --dashboard-id (string)
          The ID of the dashboard that you have started a snapshot job for.

       --snapshot-job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be described. The job ID is set when you  start
          a new job with a StartDashboardSnapshotJob API call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the snapshot job. The job ARN  is
          generated  when you start a new job with a StartDashboardSnapshotJob
          API call.

       JobStatus -> (string)
