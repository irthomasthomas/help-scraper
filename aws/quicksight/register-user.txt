REGISTER-USER()                                                REGISTER-USER()



NAME
       register-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon QuickSight user whose identity is associated with the
       Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity or role specified in  the
       request.  When  you register a new user from the Amazon QuickSight API,
       Amazon QuickSight generates a registration URL. The user accesses  this
       registration  URL  to  create  their account. Amazon QuickSight doesn't
       send a registration email to users who are registered from  the  Amazon
       QuickSight  API. If you want new users to receive a registration email,
       then add those users in the Amazon QuickSight console. For more  infor-
       mation  on registering a new user in the Amazon QuickSight console, see
       Inviting users to access Amazon QuickSight .

OPTIONS
       --identity-type (string)
          Amazon QuickSight supports several ways of managing the identity  of
          users. This parameter accepts two values:

          o IAM : A user whose identity maps to an existing IAM user or role.

          o QUICKSIGHT : A user whose identity is owned and managed internally
            by Amazon QuickSight.

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o QUICKSIGHT

          o IAM_IDENTITY_CENTER

       --email (string)
          The email address of the user that you want to register.

       --user-role (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight role for the user. The user role can be one of
          the following:

          o READER : A user who has read-only access to dashboards.

          o AUTHOR  :  A user who can create data sources, datasets, analyses,
            and dashboards.

          o ADMIN : A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon Quick-
            Sight settings.

          o RESTRICTED_READER : This role isn't currently available for use.

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR : This role isn't currently available for use.

          Possible values:

          o ADMIN

          o AUTHOR

          o READER

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR

          o RESTRICTED_READER

       --iam-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM user or role that you are registering with Amazon
          QuickSight.

       --session-name (string)
          You need to use this parameter only when you register  one  or  more
          users  using an assumed IAM role. You don't need to provide the ses-
          sion name for other scenarios, for example when you are  registering
          an  IAM user or an Amazon QuickSight user. You can register multiple
          users using the same IAM role if each user has a  different  session
          name.  For more information on assuming IAM roles, see ` assume-role
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html`__
          in the CLI Reference.

       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that the user is in. Cur-
          rently, you use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that con-
          tains your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace. Currently, you should set this to default .

       --user-name (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to create for the user
          you are registering.

       --custom-permissions-name (string)
          (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile
          that  you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions allows
          you to control a user's access by restricting access  the  following
          operations:

          o Create and update data sources

          o Create and update datasets

          o Create and update email reports

          o Subscribe to email reports

          To  add custom permissions to an existing user, use `` UpdateUser ``
          instead.

          A set of custom permissions includes any combination  of  these  re-
          strictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for cus-
          tom permission sets by using the Amazon  QuickSight  console.  Then,
          you  use  the  RegisterUser API operation to assign the named set of
          permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.

          Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through  IAM  poli-
          cies.  Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by
          assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security co-
          horts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

          This  feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edi-
          tion subscriptions.

       --external-login-federation-provider-type (string)
          The type of supported external login provider that provides identity
          to  let  a  user  federate into Amazon QuickSight with an associated
          Identity and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported  ex-
          ternal login provider can be one of the following.

          o COGNITO  :  Amazon  Cognito.  The  provider  URL  is cognito-iden-
            tity.amazonaws.com. When choosing the COGNITO provider type,  dont
            use  the  "CustomFederationProviderUrl"  parameter  which  is only
            needed when the external provider is custom.

          o CUSTOM_OIDC : Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing
            CUSTOM_OIDC type, use the CustomFederationProviderUrl parameter to
            provide the custom OIDC provider URL.

       --custom-federation-provider-url (string)
          The URL of the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider  that  provides
          identity to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an asso-
          ciated Identity and  Access  Management(IAM)  role.  This  parameter
          should only be used when ExternalLoginFederationProviderType parame-
          ter is set to CUSTOM_OIDC .

       --external-login-id (string)
          The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to associate with the user.

                 Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
