DESCRIPTION
       Use  the DescribeAccountSubscription operation to receive a description
       of a Amazon QuickSight account's subscription. A  successful  API  call
       returns  an  AccountInfo  object  that includes an account's name, sub-
       scription status, authentication type, edition, and notification  email
       address.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-subscription
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account  ID  associated with your Amazon
          QuickSight account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
