SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()                                        SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()



NAME
       search-dashboards -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for dashboards that belong to a user.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-dashboards is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DashboardSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Amazon Web Services account that contains the user
          whose dashboards you're searching for.

       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the search. Currently, you can  search  only
          by user name, for example, "Filters": [ { "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
          "Operator":      "StringEquals",      "Value":       "arn:aws:quick-
          sight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" } ]

          (structure)
              A filter that you apply when searching for dashboards.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example  "Operator":  "StringEquals"  .  Valid   values   are
                 "StringEquals" and "StringLike" .

                 If you set the operator value to "StringEquals" , you need to
                 provide an ownership related filter in the "NAME"  field  and
                 the arn of the user or group whose folders you want to search
                 in the  "Value"  field.  For  example,  "Name":"DIRECT_QUICK-
                 SIGHT_OWNER",     "Operator":     "StringEquals",    "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

                 If you set the value to "StringLike" , you  need  to  provide
                 the  name  of the folders you are searching for. For example,
                 "Name":"DASHBOARD_NAME", "Operator":  "StringLike",  "Value":
                 "Test"  .  The  "StringLike"  operator only supports the NAME
                 value DASHBOARD_NAME .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example, "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_OWNER" .

                 Valid values are defined as follows:

                 o QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER  :  Provide  an ARN of a user or
                   group, and any dashboards with that ARN listed  as  one  of
                   the  dashboards's  owners or viewers are returned. Implicit
                   permissions from folders or groups are considered.

                 o QUICKSIGHT_OWNER : Provide an ARN of a user or  group,  and
                   any dashboards with that ARN listed as one of the owners of
                   the dashboards  are  returned.  Implicit  permissions  from
                   folders or groups are considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER  : Provide an ARN of a user or
                   group, and any dashboards with that ARN listed as the  only
                   owner  of  the dashboard are returned. Implicit permissions
                   from folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER : Provide  an  ARN  of  a  user  or
                   group,  and  any  dashboards with that ARN listed as one of
                   the owners of the dashboards are returned. Implicit permis-
                   sions from folders or groups are not considered.

                 o DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER  :  Provide  an  ARN of a
                   user or group, and any dashboards with that ARN  listed  as
                   one  of  the  owners  or  viewers of the dashboards are re-
                   turned. Implicit permissions from folders or groups are not
                   considered.

                 o DASHBOARD_NAME  :  Any  dashboards  whose names have a sub-
                   string match to this value will be returned.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the named item, in this case  QUICKSIGHT_USER  ,
                 that  you  want  to  use  as  a filter, for example, "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals"|"StringLike",
              "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER"|"QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_VIEWER_OR_OWNER"|"QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_OWNER"|"DIRECT_QUICKSIGHT_SOLE_OWNER"|"DASHBOARD_NAME",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
