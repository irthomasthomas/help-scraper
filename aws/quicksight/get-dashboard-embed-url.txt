GET-DASHBOARD-EMBED-URL()                            GET-DASHBOARD-EMBED-URL()



NAME
       get-dashboard-embed-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  a temporary session URL and authorization code(bearer token)
       that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight read-only  dashboard  in
       your  website  or  application.  Before you use this command, make sure
       that you have configured the dashboards and permissions.

       Currently, you can use GetDashboardEmbedURL only from the  server,  not
       from  the  user's  browser.  The following rules apply to the generated
       URL:

       o They must be used together.

       o They can be used one time only.

       o They are valid for 5 minutes after you run this command.

       o You are charged only when the URL is used  or  there  is  interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       o The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (default) up to 10
         hours (maximum). You can use  the  optional  SessionLifetimeInMinutes
         parameter to customize session duration.

       For  more  information,  see  Embedding Analytics Using GetDashboardEm-
       bedUrl in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

       For more information about the high-level steps for embedding  and  for
       an  interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the
       Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal .

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains  the  dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --dashboard-id (string)
          The ID for the dashboard, also added to the Identity and Access Man-
          agement (IAM) policy.

       --identity-type (string)
          The authentication method that the user uses to sign in.

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o QUICKSIGHT

          o ANONYMOUS

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must  be
          15-600 minutes.

       --undo-redo-disabled | --no-undo-redo-disabled (boolean)
          Remove  the  undo/redo button on the embedded dashboard. The default
          is FALSE, which enables the undo/redo button.

       --reset-disabled | --no-reset-disabled (boolean)
          Remove the reset button on the embedded dashboard.  The  default  is
          FALSE, which enables the reset button.

       --state-persistence-enabled | --no-state-persistence-enabled (boolean)
          Adds  persistence of state for the user session in an embedded dash-
          board. Persistence applies to the sheet and the parameter  settings.
          These  are  control  settings  that the dashboard subscriber (Amazon
          QuickSight reader) chooses while viewing the dashboard. If  this  is
          set  to TRUE , the settings are the same when the subscriber reopens
          the same dashboard URL. The state is stored  in  Amazon  QuickSight,
          not  in  a browser cookie. If this is set to FALSE, the state of the
          user session is not persisted. The default is FALSE .

       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user's Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN),  for  use
          with  QUICKSIGHT  identity  type.  You  can  use this for any Amazon
          QuickSight users in your account (readers, authors, or  admins)  au-
          thenticated as one of the following:

          o Active Directory (AD) users or group members

          o Invited nonfederated users

          o IAM users and IAM role-based sessions authenticated through Feder-
            ated Single Sign-On using SAML, OpenID Connect, or IAM federation.

          Omit this parameter for users in the third group  IAM users and  IAM
          role-based sessions.

       --namespace (string)
          The  Amazon  QuickSight namespace that contains the dashboard IDs in
          this request. If you're not using a custom namespace, set  Namespace
          = default .

       --additional-dashboard-ids (list)
          A list of one or more dashboard IDs that you want anonymous users to
          have tempporary access to.  Currently,  the  IdentityType  parameter
          must  be  set to ANONYMOUS because other identity types authenticate
          as Amazon QuickSight or IAM users. For example, if you set  "--dash-
          board-id  dash_id1  --dashboard-id  dash_id2  dash_id3 identity-type
          ANONYMOUS ", the session can access all three dashboards.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       EmbedUrl -> (string)

          embed your dashboard. This URL is valid for 5 minutes. The API oper-
          ation provides the URL with an auth_code value that enables one (and
