NAME
       generate-embed-url-for-registered-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
       experience in your website. This action can be used  for  any  type  of
       user  registered  in  an Amazon QuickSight account. Before you use this
       action, make sure that you have configured the relevant  Amazon  Quick-
       Sight resource and permissions.

       The following rules apply to the generated URL:

       o It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
         it is generated. Once redeemed  within  this  period,  it  cannot  be
         re-used again.

       o The  URL  validity period should not be confused with the actual ses-
         sion   lifetime   that   can   be    customized    using    the    ``
         SessionLifetimeInMinutes  `` parameter. The resulting user session is
         valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to 10  hours  (maximum).  The  default
         session duration is 10 hours.

       o You  are  charged  only  when the URL is used or there is interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       For more information, see Embedded Analytics in the  Amazon  QuickSight
       User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  for the Amazon Web Services account that contains the dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must  be
          in [15-600] minutes range.

       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name for the registered user.

       --experience-configuration (structure)
          The experience that you want to embed. For registered users, you can
          embed Amazon QuickSight dashboards, Amazon QuickSight  visuals,  the
          Amazon QuickSight Q search bar, the Amazon QuickSight Generative Q&A
          experience, or the entire Amazon QuickSight console.

          Dashboard -> (structure)
              The configuration details for providing  a  dashboard  embedding
              experience.

                 The  dashboard ID for the dashboard that you want the user to
                 see first. This ID is included in the output  URL.  When  the
                 URL  in  response is accessed, Amazon QuickSight renders this
                 dashboard if the user has permissions to view it.

                 If the user does not have permission to view this  dashboard,
                 they see a permissions error message.

              FeatureConfigurations -> (structure)
                 The  feature configurations of an embbedded Amazon QuickSight

                        persistence settings are turned on or off.

                 Bookmarks -> (structure)
                     The  bookmarks configuration for an embedded dashboard in
                     Amazon QuickSight.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)

              formation, see Customizing Access to the Amazon QuickSight  Con-
              sole in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

              Use  ``  GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser  `` where you want to
              provide an authoring portal that allows  users  to  create  data
              sources,  datasets,  analyses, and dashboards. The users who ac-
              cesses an embedded Amazon QuickSight console needs to belong  to
              the  author  or  admin  security cohort. If you want to restrict
              permissions to some of these features, add a custom  permissions
              profile to the user with the `` UpdateUser `` API operation. Use
              the `` RegisterUser `` API operation to add a new  user  with  a
              custom  permission  profile  attached. For more information, see
              the following sections in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide :

                 The ID of the legacy Q topic that you  want  to  use  as  the
                 starting topic in the Q search bar. To locate the topic ID of

                 console  , navigate to the Topics pane, and choose thre topic
                 that you want to use. The TopicID is located in  the  URL  of
                 the  topic  that opens. When you select an initial topic, you
                 can specify whether or not  readers  are  allowed  to  select
                 other topics from the list of available topics.

                     on-visual menu of the Amazon QuickSight console. You  can
                     also get the DashboardId with a ListDashboards API opera-
                     tion.

                     ual menu of the Amazon QuickSight console.

                 VisualId -> (string)
                     The ID of the visual that you want to embed. The VisualID
                     can be found in the IDs for developers section of the Em-
                     bed  visual  pane  of  the visual's on-visual menu of the

              InitialTopicId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the new Q reader experience topic that you want to
                 make the starting topic in the Generative Q&A experience. You
                 can  find  a topic ID by navigating to the Topics pane in the
                 Amazon QuickSight application and opening a topic. The ID  is
                 in the URL for the topic that you open.

                 If you don't specify an initial topic or you specify a legacy
                 topic, a list of all shared new reader experience  topics  is
                 shown in the Generative Q&A experience for your readers. When
                 you select an initial new reader experience  topic,  you  can
                 specify  whether  or  not readers are allowed to select other
                 new reader experience topics from the available ones  in  the
                 list.

       --allowed-domains (list)
          The domains that you want to add to the allow list for access to the
          generated URL that is then embedded. This optional  parameter  over-
          rides  the  static  domains that are configured in the Manage Quick-
          Sight menu in the Amazon QuickSight console. Instead, it allows only
          the  domains  that you include in this parameter. You can list up to
          three domains or subdomains in each API call.

          To include all subdomains under a specific domain to the allow list,
          use  *  . For example, https://*.sapp.amazon.com includes all subdo-
          mains under https://sapp.amazon.com .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
