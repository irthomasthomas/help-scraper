OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  Amazon Web Services account ID of the account that contains the
          VPC connection that you want described.

       --vpc-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC connection that you're  creating.  This  ID  is  a
          unique  identifier  for each Amazon Web Services Region in an Amazon
          Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
