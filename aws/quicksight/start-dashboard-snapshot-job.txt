NAME
       start-dashboard-snapshot-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts an asynchronous job that generates a dashboard snapshot. You can
       request one of the following format configurations per API call.

       o 1 paginated PDF

       o 1 Excel workbook

       o 5 CSVs

       Poll job descriptions with  a  DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob  API  call.
       Once  the  job succeeds, use the DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult API
       to obtain the download URIs that the job generates.

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that the  dashboard  snap-
          shot job is executed in.

       --dashboard-id (string)
          The ID of the dashboard that you want to start a snapshot job for.

       --snapshot-job-id (string)
          An ID for the dashboard snapshot job. This ID is unique to the dash-
          board while the job is running. This ID can be used to poll the sta-
          tus of a job with a DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob while the job runs.
          You can reuse this ID for another job 24 hours after the current job
          is completed.

       --user-configuration (structure)
          A structure that contains information about the anonymous users that
          the generated snapshot is for. This API will not return  information
          about registered Amazon QuickSight.

          AnonymousUsers -> (list)
              An  array  of records that describe the anonymous users that the

              (structure)

                 configuration.

                 RowLevelPermissionTags -> (list)
                     The  tags  to  be used for row-level security (RLS). Make
                     sure that the relevant datasets have RLS tags  configured
                     before you start a snapshot export job. You can configure
                     the RLS tags of a dataset with a  DataSet$RowLevelPermis-
                     sionTagConfiguration API call.

                     These  are not the tags that are used for Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resource tagging. For more information on row level
                     security  in Amazon QuickSight, see Using Row-Level Secu-
                     rity (RLS) with Tags in the Amazon QuickSight User  Guide
                     .

                     (structure)
                        The  key-value  pair  used  for the row-level security
                        tags feature.

                                   in this structure determines the  order  of

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
