TAG-RESOURCE()                                                  TAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       tag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Assigns  one  or  more  tags  (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon
       QuickSight resource.

       Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can  also
       use  them  to  scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to
       access or change only resources with certain tag values.  You  can  use
       the TagResource operation with a resource that already has tags. If you
       specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag  is  appended  to  the
       list  of  tags  associated  with the resource. If you specify a tag key
       that is already associated with the resource, the new  tag  value  that
       you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

       You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon QuickSight
       supports tagging on data set, data  source,  dashboard,  template,  and
       topic.

       Tagging  for  Amazon  QuickSight  works in a similar way to tagging for
       other Amazon Web Services services, except for the following:

       o You can't use tags to track costs for Amazon QuickSight.  This  isn't
         possible  because  you can't tag the resources that Amazon QuickSight
         costs are based on, for example Amazon  QuickSight  storage  capacity
         (SPICE), number of users, type of users, and usage metrics.

       o Amazon  QuickSight  doesn't  currently support the tag editor for Re-
         source Groups.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you want to tag.

       --tags (list)
          Contains a map of the key-value pairs for the resource tag  or  tags
          assigned to the resource.

          (structure)
              The  key  or keys of the key-value pairs for the resource tag or
              tags assigned to the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 Tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
