OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that  the  group  is  in.
          Currently,  you  use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that
          contains your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return from this request.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace that you want to search.

       --filters (list)
          The structure for the search filters that you want to apply to  your
          search.

          (structure)
              A  GroupSearchFilter  object  that  you  want  to  apply to your
              search.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example  "Operator":  "StartsWith" . Currently, the only sup-
                 ported operator is StartsWith .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example  "Name": "GROUP_NAME" . Currently, the only supported
                 name is GROUP_NAME .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the named item, in this case GROUP_NAME  ,  that
                 you want to use as a filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StartsWith",
              "Name": "GROUP_NAME",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
