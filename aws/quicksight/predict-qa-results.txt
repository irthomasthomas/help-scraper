OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that the user wants to ex-
          ecute Predict QA results in.

       --query-text (string)
          The query text to be used to predict QA results.

       --include-quick-sight-q-index (string)
          Indicates whether Q indicies are included or excluded.

          Possible values:

          o INCLUDE

          o EXCLUDE

       --include-generated-answer (string)
          Indicates whether generated answers are included or excluded.

          o EXCLUDE

       --max-topics-to-consider (integer)
          The number of maximum topics to be considered to predict QA results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
