SEND-BULK-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()                        SEND-BULK-TEMPLATED-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-bulk-templated-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes an email message to multiple destinations. The message body is
       created using an email template.

       To send email using this operation, your call must meet  the  following
       requirements:

       o The  call  must  refer  to an existing email template. You can create
         email templates using  CreateTemplate .

       o The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may send only
         to  verified  addresses  or domains, or to email addresses associated
         with the Amazon SES Mailbox  Simulator.  For  more  information,  see
         Verifying  Email  Addresses  and  Domains in the Amazon SES Developer
         Guide.

       o The maximum message size is 10 MB.

       o Each Destination parameter must include at least one recipient  email
         address.  The  recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address,
         or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that  is,
         it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),
         the entire message is rejected, even if the  message  contains  other
         recipients that are valid.

       o The  message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the To:,
         CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
         audience,  you  can  divide  your recipient list into groups of 50 or
         fewer, and then call  the  SendBulkTemplatedEmail  operation  several
         times to send the message to each group.

       o The  number  of  destinations you can contact in a single call can be
         limited by your account's maximum sending rate.

OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The email address that is sending the email. This email address must
          be  either  individually  verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain
          that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about  veri-
          fying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted
          to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also spec-
          ify  the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending au-
          thorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in  RFC6531  . For this reason, the email address string must be
              7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that
              contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you
              must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted
              in  the  local  part of the email address (the part before the @
              sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to  use  Uni-
              code characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the
              "friendly from" name using  MIME  encoded-word  syntax,  as  de-
              scribed in Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API . For more
              information about Punycode, see RFC 3492 .

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to send for the email address  specified  in
          the Source parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to  it  that  authorizes you to send from user@example.com ,
          then    you    would     specify     the     SourceArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  reply-to  email  address(es)  for the message. If the recipient
          replies to the message, each reply-to address receives the reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --return-path (string)
          The email address that bounces and complaints are forwarded to  when
          feedback  forwarding  is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered
          to the recipient, then an error message is returned from the recipi-
          ent's  ISP; this message is forwarded to the email address specified
          by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never over-
          written.  This  email  address  must be either individually verified
          with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon
          SES.

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com ,  then
          you      would      specify      the     ReturnPathArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email  us-
          ing SendBulkTemplatedEmail .

       --default-tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags,  in  the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an
          email that you send to a destination using SendBulkTemplatedEmail .

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that  you  can  provide  to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message  tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable you
              to publish email sending events.  For  information  about  using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  tag. The name must meet the following re-
                 quirements:

                 o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers  (0-9),  un-
                   derscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain 256 characters or fewer.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. The value must meet the following re-
                 quirements:

                 o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers  (0-9),  un-
                   derscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain 256 characters or fewer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --template (string)
          The template to use when sending this email.

       --template-arn (string)
          The ARN of the template to use when sending this email.

       --default-template-data (string)
          A  list of replacement values to apply to the template when replace-
          ment data is not specified in a Destination object. These values act
          as a default or fallback option when no other data is available.

          The  template  data  is  a  JSON  object,  typically  consisting  of
          key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to replacement tags  in
          the email template.

       --destinations (list)
          One or more Destination objects. All of the recipients in a Destina-
          tion receive the same version of the email. You can specify up to 50
          Destination objects within a Destinations array.

          (structure)
              An  array that contains one or more Destinations, as well as the
              tags and replacement data associated with each of those Destina-
              tions.

              Destination -> (structure)
                 Represents the destination of the message, consisting of To:,
                 CC:, and BCC: fields.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon SES does not support the  SMTPUTF8  extension,  as
                     described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the email address
                     string must be 7-bit ASCII. If you want  to  send  to  or
                     from  email  addresses that contain Unicode characters in
                     the domain part of an address, you must encode the domain
                     using  Punycode.  Punycode  is not permitted in the local
                     part of the email address (the part before  the  @  sign)
                     nor  in the "friendly from" name. If you want to use Uni-
                     code characters in the "friendly from" name, you must en-
                     code  the  "friendly  from"  name using MIME encoded-word
                     syntax, as described in Sending raw email using the  Ama-
                     zon  SES  API  . For more information about Punycode, see
                     RFC 3492 .

              ReplacementTags -> (list)
                 A list of tags, in the form of name/value pairs, to apply  to
                 an  email  that  you send using SendBulkTemplatedEmail . Tags
                 correspond to characteristics of the email that  you  define,
                 so that you can publish email sending events.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the name and value of a tag that you can provide
                     to SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

                     Message tags, which you use with configuration sets,  en-
                     able you to publish email sending events. For information
                     about using configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Devel-

            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
