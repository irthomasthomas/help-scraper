CREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESCREATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       create-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a configuration set event destination.

       NOTE:
          When  you  create  or  update an event destination, you must provide
          one, and only one, destination. The destination can  be  CloudWatch,
          Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Ama-
          zon SNS).

       An event destination is the Amazon Web Services service to which Amazon
       SES  publishes the email sending events associated with a configuration
       set. For information about using configuration sets, see the Amazon SES
       Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
