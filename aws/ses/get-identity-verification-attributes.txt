GET-IDENTITY-VERIFICATION-ATTRIBUTES()  GET-IDENTITY-VERIFICATION-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-identity-verification-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  list  of identities (email addresses and/or domains), returns
       the verification status and (for domain  identities)  the  verification
       token for each identity.

       The  verification  status  of  an  email address is "Pending" until the
       email address owner clicks the link within the verification email  that
       Amazon  SES sent to that address. If the email address owner clicks the
       link within 24 hours, the verification  status  of  the  email  address
       changes  to  "Success". If the link is not clicked within 24 hours, the
       verification status changes to "Failed." In that  case,  if  you  still
       want  to  verify  the  email address, you must restart the verification
       process from the beginning.

       For domain identities, the domain's verification status is "Pending" as
       Amazon  SES searches for the required TXT record in the DNS settings of
       the domain. When Amazon SES detects the record, the domain's  verifica-
       tion status changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is unable to detect the
       record within 72 hours, the domain's  verification  status  changes  to
       "Failed."  In  that  case,  if you still want to verify the domain, you
       must restart the verification process from the beginning.

       This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only  get
       verification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

OPTIONS
       --identities (list)
          A list of identities.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the Amazon SES verification status for a list of identities

       The  following  example  uses  the get-identity-verification-attributes
       command to retrieve the Amazon SES verification status for  a  list  of
       identities:

          aws ses get-identity-verification-attributes --identities "user1@example.com" "user2@example.com"

       Output:

          {
             "VerificationAttributes": {
                 "user1@example.com": {
                     "VerificationStatus": "Success"
                 },
                 "user2@example.com": {
                     "VerificationStatus": "Pending"
                 }
             }
          }

       If you call this command with an identity that you have never submitted
       for verification, that identity won't appear in the output.

       For more information about verified identities, see Verifying Email Ad-
       dresses  and  Domains  in Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple Email Service
       Developer Guide.
