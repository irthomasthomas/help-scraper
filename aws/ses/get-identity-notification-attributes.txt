NAME
       get-identity-notification-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  list of verified identities (email addresses and/or domains),
       returns a structure describing identity notification attributes.

       This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only  get
       notification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

       For more information about using notifications with Amazon SES, see the
       Amazon SES Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --identities (list)
          A list of one or more identities. You can specify an identity by us-
          ing  its  name or by using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Examples:
          user@example.com             ,             example.com             ,
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the Amazon SES notification attributes for a list of identities

       The  following  example  uses  the get-identity-notification-attributes
       command to retrieve the Amazon SES notification attributes for  a  list
       of identities:

          aws ses get-identity-notification-attributes --identities "user1@example.com" "user2@example.com"

       Output:

          {
             "NotificationAttributes": {
                 "user1@example.com": {
                     "ForwardingEnabled": false,
                     "ComplaintTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic",
                     "BounceTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic",
                     "DeliveryTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic"
                 },
                 "user2@example.com": {
                     "ForwardingEnabled": true
                 }
             }
          }

       This  command  returns  the status of email feedback forwarding and, if
       applicable, the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Amazon  SNS  topics
       that bounce, complaint, and delivery notifications are sent to.

       If you call this command with an identity that you have never submitted
       for verification, that identity won't appear in the output.

       For more information about notifications, see Using Notifications  With
       Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.
