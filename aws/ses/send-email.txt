SEND-EMAIL()                                                      SEND-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes  an  email  message  and immediately queues it for sending. To
       send email using this operation, your message must meet  the  following
       requirements:

       o The  message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If
         you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the
         operation results in an "Email address not verified" error.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
         to verified addresses or domains, or to  email  addresses  associated
         with  the  Amazon  SES  Mailbox  Simulator. For more information, see
         Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in  the  Amazon  SES  Developer
         Guide.

       o The maximum message size is 10 MB.

       o The  message  must  include at least one recipient email address. The
         recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:  ad-
         dress. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in
         the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),  the  entire
         message  is  rejected,  even if the message contains other recipients
         that are valid.

       o The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the  To:,
         CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
         audience, you can divide your recipient list into  groups  of  50  or
         fewer,  and  then  call the SendEmail operation several times to send
         the message to each group.

       WARNING:
          For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (in-
          cluding  each  recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
          against the maximum number of emails you can send in a  24-hour  pe-
          riod  (your sending quota ). For more information about sending quo-
          tas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES  Sending  Limits  in
          the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

            }
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)

          "string" "string" ...

       --return-path (string)
          The email address that bounces and complaints are forwarded to  when
          feedback  forwarding  is enabled. If the message cannot be delivered
          to the recipient, then an error message is returned from the recipi-
          ent's  ISP; this message is forwarded to the email address specified
          by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never over-
          written.  This  email  address  must be either individually verified
          with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon
          SES.

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits you to send for the email address specified in
          the Source parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to  send  from  user@example.com  ,
          then     you     would     specify     the     SourceArn    to    be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the email address  specified  in  the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com , then
          you     would     specify     the      ReturnPathArn      to      be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags,  in  the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an
          email that you send using SendEmail . Tags correspond to  character-
          istics  of  the email that you define, so that you can publish email
          sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that  you  can  provide  to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message  tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable you
              to publish email sending events.  For  information  about  using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  tag. The name must meet the following re-
                 quirements:

                 o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers  (0-9),  un-
                   derscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain 256 characters or fewer.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. The value must meet the following re-
                 quirements:

                 o Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers  (0-9),  un-
                   derscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain 256 characters or fewer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name of the configuration set to use when you send an email us-
          ing SendEmail .

       --from (string)
          The email address that is sending the email. This email address must
          be  either  individually  verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain
          that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about  veri-
          fying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted
          to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also spec-
          ify  the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending au-
          thorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in  RFC6531  . For this reason, the email address string must be
              7-bit ASCII. If you want to send to or from email addresses that
              contain Unicode characters in the domain part of an address, you
              must encode the domain using Punycode. Punycode is not permitted
              in  the  local  part of the email address (the part before the @
              sign) nor in the "friendly from" name. If you want to  use  Uni-
              code characters in the "friendly from" name, you must encode the
              "friendly from" name using  MIME  encoded-word  syntax,  as  de-
              scribed in Sending raw email using the Amazon SES API . For more
              information about Punycode, see RFC 3492 .

       --to (string) The email addresses of the primary  recipients.  You  can
       specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --cc  (string)  The  email  addresses  of copy recipients (Cc). You can
       specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --bcc (string) The  email  addresses  of  blind-carbon-copy  recipients
       (Bcc). You can specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --subject (string) The subject of the message

       --text (string) The raw text body of the message

       --html (string) The HTML body of the message

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To send a formatted email using Amazon SES

       The following example uses the send-email command to send  a  formatted
       email:

          aws ses send-email --from sender@example.com --destination file://destination.json --message file://message.json

       Output:

          {
             "MessageId": "EXAMPLEf3a5efcd1-51adec81-d2a4-4e3f-9fe2-5d85c1b23783-000000"
          }

       The destination and the message are JSON data structures saved in .json
       files in the current directory. These files are as follows:

       destination.json:

          {
            "ToAddresses":  ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"],
            "CcAddresses":  ["recipient3@example.com"],
            "BccAddresses": []
          }

       message.json:

          {
             "Subject": {
                 "Data": "Test email sent using the AWS CLI",
                 "Charset": "UTF-8"
             },
             "Body": {
                 "Text": {
                     "Data": "This is the message body in text format.",
                     "Charset": "UTF-8"
                 },
                 "Html": {
                     "Data": "This message body contains HTML formatting. It can, for example, contain links like this one: <a class=\"ulink\" href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a>.",
                     "Charset": "UTF-8"
                 }
             }
          }

       Replace the sender and recipient email addresses with the ones you want
       to use. Note that the sender's email address must be verified with Ama-
       zon SES. Until you are granted production access  to  Amazon  SES,  you
       must also verify the email address of each recipient unless the recipi-
       ent is the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. For more information on  veri-
       fication,  see  Verifying  Email Addresses and Domains in Amazon SES in
       the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

       The Message ID in the output indicates that the call to send-email  was
       successful.

       If you don't receive the email, check your Junk box.

       For  more information on sending formatted email, see Sending Formatted
       Email Using the Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email  Service  De-
       veloper Guide.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The unique message identifier returned from the SendEmail action.
