GET-IDENTITY-POLICIES()                                GET-IDENTITY-POLICIES()



NAME
       get-identity-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  requested  sending  authorization  policies for the given
       identity (an email address or a domain). The policies are returned as a
       map  of  policy names to policy contents. You can retrieve a maximum of
       20 policies at a time.

       NOTE:
          This operation is for the identity owner only. If you have not veri-
          fied the identity, it returns an error.

       Sending  authorization  is  a feature that enables an identity owner to
       authorize other senders to use its identities.  For  information  about
       using sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

OPTIONS
       --identity (string)
          The  identity  for which the policies are retrieved. You can specify
          an identity by using its name or by using its Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN).     Examples:     user@example.com     ,     example.com    ,
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com .

          To successfully call this operation, you must own the identity.

       --policy-names (list)
          A list of the names of policies to be retrieved. You can retrieve  a
          maximum  of  20  policies at a time. If you do not know the names of
          the policies that are attached to the identity, you can  use  ListI-
          dentityPolicies .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
