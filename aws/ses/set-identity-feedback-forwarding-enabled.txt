SET-IDENTITY-FEEDBACK-FORWARDING-ENASET-IDENTITY-FEEDBACK-FORWARDING-ENABLED()



NAME
       set-identity-feedback-forwarding-enabled -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  an  identity (an email address or a domain), enables or disables
       whether Amazon SES  forwards  bounce  and  complaint  notifications  as
       email.  Feedback forwarding can only be disabled when Amazon Simple No-
       tification Service (Amazon SNS) topics are specified for  both  bounces
       and complaints.

       NOTE:
          Feedback forwarding does not apply to delivery notifications. Deliv-
          ery notifications are only available through Amazon SNS.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       For more information about using notifications with Amazon SES, see the
       Amazon SES Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --identity (string)
          The identity for which to set bounce and complaint notification for-
          warding. Examples: user@example.com , example.com .

       --forwarding-enabled | --no-forwarding-enabled (boolean)
          Sets whether Amazon SES forwards bounce and complaint  notifications
          as  email.  true  specifies that Amazon SES forwards bounce and com-
          plaint notifications as email, in addition to any Amazon  SNS  topic
          publishing otherwise specified. false specifies that Amazon SES pub-
          lishes bounce and complaint notifications only through  Amazon  SNS.
          This  value  can only be set to false when Amazon SNS topics are set
          for both Bounce and Complaint notification types.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable or disable bounce and complaint email feedback forwarding for
       an Amazon SES verified identity

       The following example uses the set-identity-feedback-forwarding-enabled
       command to enable a verified email address to receive bounce  and  com-
       plaint notifications by email:

          aws ses set-identity-feedback-forwarding-enabled --identity user@example.com --forwarding-enabled

       You  are required to receive bounce and complaint notifications via ei-
       ther Amazon SNS or email feedback forwarding, so you can  only  disable
       email  feedback  forwarding  if you select an Amazon SNS topic for both
       bounce and complaint notifications.

       For more information about notifications, see Using Notifications  With
       Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
