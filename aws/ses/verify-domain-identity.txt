SYNOPSIS
            verify-domain-identity
          --domain <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain to be verified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To verify a domain with Amazon SES

       The following example uses the verify-domain-identity command to verify
       a domain:

          aws ses verify-domain-identity --domain example.com

       Output:

          {
             "VerificationToken": "eoEmxw+YaYhb3h3iVJHuXMJXqeu1q1/wwmvjuEXAMPLE"
          }

       To complete domain verification, you must add a TXT record with the re-
       turned verification token to your domain's DNS settings. For  more  in-
       formation,  see  Verifying  Domains  in Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple
       Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VerificationToken -> (string)
          A TXT record that you must place in the DNS settings of  the  domain
          to complete domain verification with Amazon SES.

          As Amazon SES searches for the TXT record, the domain's verification
          status is "Pending". When Amazon SES detects  the  record,  the  do-
          main's  verification  status  changes to "Success". If Amazon SES is
          unable to detect the record within 72 hours, the domain's  verifica-
          tion status changes to "Failed." In that case, to verify the domain,
          you must restart the verification process from  the  beginning.  The
          domain's  verification  status  also changes to "Success" when it is
          DKIM verified.
