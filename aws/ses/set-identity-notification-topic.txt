SET-IDENTITY-NOTIFICATION-TOPIC()            SET-IDENTITY-NOTIFICATION-TOPIC()



NAME
       set-identity-notification-topic -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  an  Amazon  Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to use
       when delivering notifications. When you use this operation, you specify
       a  verified identity, such as an email address or domain. When you send
       an email that uses the chosen identity in the Source field, Amazon  SES
       sends  notifications  to  the topic you specified. You can send bounce,
       complaint, or delivery notifications (or any combination of the  three)
       to the Amazon SNS topic that you specify.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       For  more  information  about feedback notification, see the Amazon SES
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --identity (string)
          The identity (email address or domain) that you want to set the Ama-
          zon SNS topic for.

          WARNING:
              You can only specify a verified identity for this parameter.

          You can specify an identity by using its name or by using its Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN). The following examples are  all  valid  identi-
          ties:        sender@example.com        ,        example.com        ,
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com .

       --notification-type (string)
          The type of notifications that will be published  to  the  specified
          Amazon SNS topic.

          Possible values:

          o Bounce

          o Complaint

          o Delivery

       --sns-topic (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic. If the pa-
          rameter is omitted from the request  or  a  null  value  is  passed,
          SnsTopic is cleared and publishing is disabled.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  set  the  Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon SES will publish bounce,
       complaint, and/or delivery notifications for a verified identity

       The following example uses the set-identity-notification-topic  command
       to  specify the Amazon SNS topic to which a verified email address will
       receive bounce notifications:

          aws ses set-identity-notification-topic --identity user@example.com --notification-type Bounce --sns-topic arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic

       For more information about notifications, see Using Notifications  With
       Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.
