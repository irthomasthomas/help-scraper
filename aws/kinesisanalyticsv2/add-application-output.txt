ADD-APPLICATION-OUTPUT()                              ADD-APPLICATION-OUTPUT()



NAME
       add-application-output -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  external destination to your SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics
       application.

       If you want Kinesis Data Analytics to deliver data from an  in-applica-
       tion stream within your application to an external destination (such as
       an Kinesis data stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream, or  an
       Amazon Lambda function), you add the relevant configuration to your ap-
       plication using this operation. You can configure one or  more  outputs
       for  your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application
       stream and an external destination.

       You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from  your
       in-application  error stream to an external destination so that you can
       analyze the errors.

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current  application
       version.

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application to which you want to add the output con-
          figuration.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The version of the application to which you want to add  the  output
          configuration. You can use the  DescribeApplication operation to get
          the current application version. If the version specified is not the
          current version, the ConcurrentModificationException is returned.

       --application-output (structure)
          An  array  of  objects, each describing one output configuration. In
          the output configuration, you specify the name of an  in-application
          stream,  a  destination  (that  is, a Kinesis data stream, a Kinesis
          Data Firehose delivery stream, or an Amazon  Lambda  function),  and
          record the formation to use when writing to the destination.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the in-application stream.

          KinesisStreamsOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies a Kinesis data stream as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the destination Kinesis data stream to write to.

          KinesisFirehoseOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream as the desti-
              nation.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the destination delivery stream to write to.

          LambdaOutput -> (structure)
              Identifies an Amazon Lambda function as the destination.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  destination  Lambda
                 function to write to.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: Amazon Lambda

          DestinationSchema -> (structure)
              Describes the data format when records are written to the desti-
              nation.

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 Specifies the format of the records on the output stream.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,KinesisStreamsOutput={ResourceARN=string},KinesisFirehoseOutput={ResourceARN=string},LambdaOutput={ResourceARN=string},DestinationSchema={RecordFormatType=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "KinesisStreamsOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string"
            },
            "KinesisFirehoseOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string"
            },
            "LambdaOutput": {
              "ResourceARN": "string"
            },
            "DestinationSchema": {
              "RecordFormatType": "JSON"|"CSV"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
