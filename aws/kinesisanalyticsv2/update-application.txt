                     fault parallelism for  the  Managed  Service  for  Apache
                     Flink  service,  or  if a custom parallelism is used. You
                     must set this property to CUSTOM in order to change  your
                     application's  AutoScalingEnabled , Parallelism , or Par-
                     allelismPerKPU properties.

                     Describes updates to the initial number of parallel tasks
                     an  application can perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set
                     to True, then Managed Service for Apache  Flink  can  in-
                     crease the CurrentParallelism value in response to appli-
                     cation load. The service can increase  CurrentParallelism
                     up to the maximum parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU
                     times the maximum KPUs for the application.  The  maximum
                     KPUs  for an application is 32 by default, and can be in-
                     creased by requesting a limit  increase.  If  application
                     load  is  reduced,  the service will reduce CurrentParal-
                     lelism down to the Parallelism setting.

                 When restoring from a snapshot, specifies whether the runtime
                 is allowed to skip a state that cannot be mapped to  the  new
                 program.  This  will happen if the program is updated between
                 snapshots to remove stateful parameters, and  state  data  in
                 the snapshot no longer corresponds to valid application data.
                 For more information, see Allowing Non-Restored State in  the
                 Apache Flink documentation .

              SnapshotName -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of an existing snapshot of application state
                 to use to restart an application. The application  uses  this
                 value  if  RESTORE_FROM_CUSTOM_SNAPSHOT  is specified for the
                 ApplicationRestoreType .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     tiple tasks simultaneously.

                     ConfigurationType -> (string)
                        Describes whether the  application  uses  the  default
                        parallelism  for  the Managed Service for Apache Flink
                        service.

                     Parallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes the initial number of parallel tasks that  a
                        Managed  Service for Apache Flink application can per-
                        form. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, then  Man-
                        aged  Service  for  Apache Flink can increase the Cur-
                        rentParallelism value in response to application load.
                        The  service can increase CurrentParallelism up to the
                        maximum parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU  times
                        the maximum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs
                        for an application is 32 by default, and  can  be  in-
                        creased by requesting a limit increase. If application
                        load is reduced, the service can reduce  the  Current-
                        Parallelism value down to the Parallelism setting.

                     ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                        Describes  the number of parallel tasks that a Managed
                        Service for Apache Flink application can  perform  per

                        Managed Service for Apache Flink application can  per-
                        form.  If  AutoScalingEnabled  is set to True, Managed
                        Service for Apache Flink can increase  this  value  in
                        response to application load. The service can increase
                        this value up to the  maximum  parallelism,  which  is
                        ParalellismPerKPU  times  the maximum KPUs for the ap-
                        plication. The maximum KPUs for an application  is  32
                        by default, and can be increased by requesting a limit
                        increase. If application load is reduced, the  service
                        can  reduce  the  CurrentParallelism value down to the
                        Parallelism setting.
