OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application for which you want to list all versions.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of versions to list in this invocation of the op-
          eration.

       --next-token (string)
          If a previous invocation of this operation returned a pagination to-
          ken,  pass  it  into this value to retrieve the next set of results.
          For more information about pagination, see Using the Amazon  Command
          Line Interface's Pagination Options .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of the application versions and the associated  configuration
          summaries.  The  list includes application versions that were rolled
          back.

          To get the complete description of a specific  application  version,
          invoke the  DescribeApplicationVersion operation.

          (structure)
              The summary of the application version.

              ApplicationVersionId -> (long)
                 The ID of the application version. Kinesis Data Analytics up-
                 dates the ApplicationVersionId each time you update  the  ap-
                 plication.

              ApplicationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the application.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token for the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results. To retrieve the next set of  items,  pass
          this  token into a subsequent invocation of this operation. For more
          information about pagination, see Using the Amazon Command Line  In-
          terface's Pagination Options .
