ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()                                ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()



NAME
       add-application-input -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a streaming source to your SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics appli-
       cation.

       You can add a streaming source when you create an application,  or  you
       can  use  this  operation to add a streaming source after you create an
       application. For more information, see  CreateApplication .

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current  application
       version.

          streaming source.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The current version of your application. You must provide the Appli-
          cationVersionID  or  the  ConditionalToken  .You  can  use  the  De-
          scribeApplication operation to find the current application version.

       --input (structure)
          The  Input to add.

          NamePrefix -> (string)
              The name prefix to use when creating an  in-application  stream.
              Suppose  that you specify a prefix "MyInApplicationStream ." Ki-
              nesis Data Analytics then creates one or more (as per the Input-
              Parallelism count you specified) in-application streams with the

              cessor transforms records as they are received from the  stream,
              before  the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the only
              input processing configuration available is   InputLambdaProces-
              sor .

              InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)

                        than  the  latest, include the Lambda function version
                        in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

                               The row delimiter. For example, in a  CSV  for-
                               mat, 'n' is the typical row delimiter.

                            RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                               The  column  delimiter.  For  example, in a CSV
                               format, a comma (",") is the typical column de-
                               limiter.

                 RecordEncoding -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  encoding  of the records in the streaming
                     source. For example, UTF-8.

                 RecordColumns -> (list)
                     A list of RecordColumn objects.

                     (structure)
                        For a SQL-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application,
                        describes  the  mapping  of  each  data element in the
                        streaming source to the corresponding  column  in  the
                        in-application stream.

                        Also used to describe the format of the reference data
                        source.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the column  that  is  created  in  the
                            in-application input stream or reference table.

                        Mapping -> (string)
                            A  reference  to the data element in the streaming
                            input or the reference data source.

                        SqlType -> (string)
                            The type of column created in  the  in-application
                            input stream or reference table.

              InputParallelism -> (structure)
                 Describes  the  configured parallelism (number of in-applica-
                 tion streams mapped to the streaming source).

                 Count -> (integer)
                     The number of in-application streams to create.

              InputStartingPositionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The point at which the application is configured to read from
                 the input stream.

                 InputStartingPosition -> (string)
                     The starting position on the stream.

                     o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record
                       in the stream, and start at the request timestamp  that
                       the customer issued.

                     o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start  reading  at  the last untrimmed
                       record in the stream, which is the oldest record avail-
                       able in the stream. This option is not available for an
                       Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.

                     o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the  ap-
                       plication last stopped reading.
