RETRIEVE-AND-GENERATE()                                RETRIEVE-AND-GENERATE()



NAME
       retrieve-and-generate -

DESCRIPTION
       Queries a knowledge base and generates responses based on the retrieved
       results. The response only cites  sources  that  are  relevant  to  the
       query.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       retrieve-and-generate  uses document type values. Document types follow
       the JSON data model where valid values are: strings, numbers, booleans,
       null, arrays, and objects. For command input, options and nested param-
       eters that are labeled with the type document must be provided as JSON.
       Shorthand syntax does not support document types.

                        Configuration  settings  specific  to  text generation
                        while generating responses using RetrieveAndGenerate.

                            are arbitary values, for actual values consult the
                            limits defined by your specific model.

                            ther tokens. Do not use a minimum length of 1 or a
                            maximum length of 1000. The limit values described
                            here are arbitary values, for actual  values  con-
                            sult the limits defined by your specific model.

                            (string)

                            language model, influencing  how  much  the  model
                            sticks  to  the most predictable next words versus
                            exploring more surprising options. A lower temper-
                            ature  value (e.g. 0.2 or 0.3) makes model outputs
                            more deterministic or predictable, while a  higher
                            temperature  (e.g.  0.8  or 0.9) makes the outputs
                            more creative or unpredictable.

                        topP -> (float)
                            A probability distribution  threshold  which  con-
                            trols what the model considers for the set of pos-
                            sible next tokens. The model  will  only  consider
                            the  top  p%  of the probability distribution when
                            generating the next token.

                 promptTemplate -> (structure)

                     textPromptTemplate -> (string)
                        The  template  for the prompt that's sent to the model
                        for response generation. You can include prompt place-
                        holders,  which  become  replaced before the prompt is
                        sent to the model to provide instructions and  context
                        to the model. In addition, you can include XML tags to
                        delineate meaningful sections of the prompt template.

       --session-configuration (structure)

          kmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the KMS key encrypting the session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --session-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier of the session. Reuse the same value to con-
          tinue the same session with the knowledge base.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
