DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon Redshift Serverless managed VPC endpoint.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-endpoint-access
          --endpoint-name <value>
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--vpc-security-group-ids <value>]
          --workgroup-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  VPC endpoint. An endpoint name must contain 1-30
          characters. Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and  hyphen(-).  The
          first character must be a letter. The name can't contain two consec-
          utive hyphens or end with a hyphen.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The unique identifers of subnets from which Amazon Redshift  Server-
          less chooses one to deploy a VPC endpoint.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          The unique identifiers of the security group that defines the ports,
          protocols, and sources for inbound traffic that you are  authorizing
          into your endpoint.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --workgroup-name (string)
          The name of the workgroup to associate with the VPC endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
