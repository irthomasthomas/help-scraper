DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a database user name and temporary password with temporary au-
       thorization to log in to Amazon Redshift Serverless.

       By default, the temporary credentials expire in 900  seconds.  You  can
       optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600
       seconds (60 minutes).
          <p> The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that  runs
          GetCredentials  must  have an IAM policy attached that allows access
          to all necessary actions and resources. </p> <p>  If  the  <code>Db-
          Name</code> parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow access
          to the resource dbname for the specified database name.</p>

SYNOPSIS
            get-credentials
          [--db-name <value>]
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          --workgroup-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-name (string)
          The name of the database to get temporary authorization  to  log  on
          to.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o Must  contain  only  lowercase  letters, numbers, underscore, plus
            sign, period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can  be  found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The number of seconds until the returned temporary password expires.
          The minimum is 900 seconds, and the maximum is 3600 seconds.

       --workgroup-name (string)
          The name of the workgroup associated with the database.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
