NAME
       mediapackagev2 -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  guide  is intended for creating AWS Elemental MediaPackage re-
          sources in MediaPackage Version 2 (v2) starting from  May  2023.  To
          get  started  with  MediaPackage  v2,  create  your MediaPackage re-
          sources. There isn't an automated process to migrate your  resources
          from MediaPackage v1 to MediaPackage v2.

          The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like URLs
          and ARNs, all have the versioning information added, like  "v2",  to
          distinguish  from  the prior version. If you used MediaPackage prior
          to this release, you can't use the MediaPackage v2 CLI or the Media-
          Package v2 API to access any MediaPackage v1 resources.

          If  you  created  resources  in MediaPackage v1, use video on demand
          (VOD) workflows, and aren't looking to migrate  to  MediaPackage  v2
          yet, see the MediaPackage v1 Live API Reference .

       This  is  the AWS Elemental MediaPackage v2 Live REST API Reference. It
       describes all the MediaPackage API operations for live content  in  de-
       tail,  and provides sample requests, responses, and errors for the sup-
       ported web services protocols.

       We assume that you have the IAM permissions that you need to use Media-
       Package via the REST API. We also assume that you are familiar with the
       features and operations of MediaPackage, as described in the  AWS  Ele-
       mental MediaPackage User Guide.
