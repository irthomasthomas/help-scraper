OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph.

       --investigation-id (string)
          The investigation ID of the investigation report.

       --indicator-type (string)
          See Detective investigations. .

          Possible values:

          o TTP_OBSERVED

          o IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL

          o FLAGGED_IP_ADDRESS

          o NEW_GEOLOCATION

          o NEW_ASO

          o NEW_USER_AGENT

          o RELATED_FINDING

          o RELATED_FINDING_GROUP

       --next-token (string)
          List  if there are more results available. The value of nextToken is
          a unique pagination token for each page. Repeat the call  using  the
          returned  token  to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments
          unchanged.

          Each pagination token expires after 24 hours. Using an expired pagi-
          nation token will return a Validation Exception error.

       --max-results (integer)
          List the maximum number of indicators in a page.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
