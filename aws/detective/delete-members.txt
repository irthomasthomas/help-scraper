DELETE-MEMBERS()                                              DELETE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       delete-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the specified member accounts from the behavior graph. The re-
       moved accounts no longer contribute data to the  behavior  graph.  This
       operation  can  only be called by the administrator account for the be-
       havior graph.

       For invited accounts, the removed accounts are deleted from the list of
       accounts in the behavior graph. To restore the account, the administra-
       tor account must send another invitation.

       For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,  the  De-
       tective  administrator  account  can always enable the organization ac-
       count again. Organization accounts that are not enabled as  member  ac-
       counts are not included in the ListMembers results for the organization
       behavior graph.

       An administrator account cannot use DeleteMembers to remove  their  own
       account  from  the behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the ad-
       ministrator account uses the DeleteGraph API method.

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph to remove members from.

       --account-ids (list)
          The list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers for  the  member
          accounts  to remove from the behavior graph. You can remove up to 50
          member accounts at a time.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To remove member accounts from a behavior graph

       The following delete-members example removes two member  accounts  from
       the              behavior              graph             arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234.  To  identify  the  ac-
       counts, the request provides the AWS account IDs.

          aws detective delete-members \
              --account-ids 444455556666 123456789012 \
              --graph-arn arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234

       Output:

           {
              "AccountIds": [ "444455556666", "123456789012" ],
              "UnprocessedAccounts": [ ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccountIds -> (list)
          The  list  of Amazon Web Services account identifiers for the member
          accounts that  Detective  successfully  removed  from  the  behavior
          graph.

       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          The  list  of  member accounts that Detective was not able to remove
          from the behavior graph. For each member account, provides the  rea-
          son that the deletion could not be processed.

          (structure)
              A  member  account  that was included in a request but for which

                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the member  ac-
                 count that was not processed.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The  reason that the member account request could not be pro-
