NAME
       get-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the membership details for specified member accounts for a be-
       havior graph.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-members
          --graph-arn <value>
          --account-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The ARN of the behavior graph for which to request  the  member  de-
          tails.

       --account-ids (list)
          The  list  of Amazon Web Services account identifiers for the member
          account for which to return member details. You can request  details
          for up to 50 member accounts at a time.

          You  cannot  use GetMembers to retrieve information about member ac-
          counts that were removed from the behavior graph.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about selected behavior graph member accounts

       The following get-members example retrieves information about two  mem-
       ber     accounts     in     the     behavior    graph    arn:aws:detec-
       tive:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234. For the  two  accounts,
       the request provides the AWS account IDs.

          aws detective get-members \
              --account-ids 444455556666 123456789012 \
              --graph-arn arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:111122223333:graph:123412341234

OUTPUT
       MemberDetails -> (list)
          The  member  account details that Detective is returning in response
          to the request.

          (structure)
              Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier for the member ac-
                 count.

              EmailAddress -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account root user email address for
                 the member account.

              GraphArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the behavior graph.

              MasterId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              AdministratorId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administra-
                 tor account for the behavior graph.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current membership status of the member account. The sta-
                 tus can have one of the following values:

                 o INVITED  -  For  invited  accounts only. Indicates that the
                   member was sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

                 o VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS - For invited accounts only, indi-
                   cates  that Detective is verifying that the account identi-
                   fier and email address  provided  for  the  member  account
                   match.  If  they do match, then Detective sends the invita-
                   tion. If the email address  and  account  identifier  don't
                   match,  then  the  member  cannot  be added to the behavior
                   graph. For organization accounts in the organization behav-
                   ior  graph,  indicates that Detective is verifying that the
                   account belongs to the organization.

                 o VERIFICATION_FAILED - For invited accounts only.  Indicates
                   that  the account and email address provided for the member
                   account do not match, and Detective did not send an invita-
                   tion to the account.

                 o ENABLED  - Indicates that the member account currently con-
                   tributes data to the behavior graph. For invited  accounts,
                   the  member  account accepted the invitation. For organiza-
                   tion accounts in the organization behavior graph,  the  De-
                   tective  administrator account enabled the organization ac-
                   count as a member account.

                 o ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED - The account  accepted  the  invita-
                   tion,  or  was  enabled  by the Detective administrator ac-
                   count, but is prevented from contributing data to  the  be-
                   havior  graph.  DisabledReason  provides the reason why the
                   member account is not enabled.

                 Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were re-
                 moved  from the behavior graph are not included. In the orga-
                 nization behavior graph, organization accounts that  the  De-
                 tective  administrator  account  did  not  enable are not in-
                 cluded.

              DisabledReason -> (string)
                 For member accounts with a status of ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED  ,
                 the reason that the member account is not enabled.

                 The reason can have one of the following values:

                 o VOLUME_TOO_HIGH  - Indicates that adding the member account
                   would cause the data volume for the behavior  graph  to  be
                   too high.

                 o VOLUME_UNKNOWN - Indicates that Detective is unable to ver-
                   ify the data volume for the member account. This is usually
                   because the member account is not enrolled in Amazon Guard-
                   Duty.

              InvitedTime -> (timestamp)
                 For invited accounts, the date and time that  Detective  sent
                 the  invitation  to the account. The value is an ISO8601 for-
                 matted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              UpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the member account was  last  updated.
                 The  value  is  an  ISO8601  formatted  string.  For example,
                 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                 The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.

              VolumeUsageUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The data and time when the member  account  data  volume  was
                 last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              PercentOfGraphUtilization -> (double)
                 The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum
                 allowed data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates
                 100 percent.

                 Note that this is not the percentage of  the  behavior  graph
                 data volume.

                 For  example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB
                 per day. The maximum data volume is 160 GB per  day.  If  the
                 data  volume  for  the  member account is 40 GB per day, then
                 PercentOfGraphUtilization is 25. It  represents  25%  of  the
                 maximum allowed data volume.

              PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time when the graph utilization percentage was
                 last updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted  string.  For
                 example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              InvitationType -> (string)
                 The type of behavior graph membership.

                 For  an  organization  account  in  the organization behavior
                 graph, the type is ORGANIZATION .

                 For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type
                 is INVITATION .

              VolumeUsageByDatasourcePackage -> (map)
                 Details  on  the volume of usage for each data source package
                 in a behavior graph.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Information on the usage of a data source package in  the
                     behavior graph.

                     VolumeUsageInBytes -> (long)
                        Total  volume  of data in bytes per day ingested for a
                        given data source package.

                     VolumeUsageUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The data and time when the member account data  volume
                        was  last  updated.  The value is an ISO8601 formatted
                        string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

              DatasourcePackageIngestStates -> (map)
                 The state of a data source package for the behavior graph.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)
          The requested member accounts for which Detective was unable to  re-
          turn member details.

          For  each  account, provides the reason why the request could not be
          processed.

          (structure)
              A member account that was included in a request  but  for  which
              the request could not be processed.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services account identifier of the member ac-
                 count that was not processed.

              Reason -> (string)
                 The reason that the member account request could not be  pro-
                 cessed.
