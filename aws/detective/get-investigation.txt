GET-INVESTIGATION()                                        GET-INVESTIGATION()



NAME
       get-investigation -

DESCRIPTION
       Detective  investigations  lets you investigate IAM users and IAM roles
       using indicators of compromise. An indicator of compromise (IOC) is  an
       artifact  observed  in or on a network, system, or environment that can
       (with a high level of confidence) identify malicious activity or a  se-
       curity  incident. GetInvestigation returns the investigation results of
       an investigation for a behavior graph.

          --graph-arn <value>
          --investigation-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]

          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --graph-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the behavior graph.

       --investigation-id (string)
          The investigation ID of the investigation report.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GraphArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the behavior graph.

       InvestigationId -> (string)
          The investigation ID of the investigation report.

       EntityArn -> (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Detective supports  IAM  user
          ARNs and IAM role ARNs.

       EntityType -> (string)

          mat.

       ScopeStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The  start date and time used to set the scope time within which you
          want to generate the investigation  report.  The  value  is  an  UTC
          ISO8601 formatted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

       ScopeEndTime -> (timestamp)
          The  data and time when the investigation began. The value is an UTC
          ISO8601 formatted string. For example, 2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z .

       Status -> (string)
          The status based on the completion status of the investigation.

       Severity -> (string)
          The severity assigned is based on the likelihood and impact  of  the
          indicators of compromise discovered in the investigation.

       State -> (string)
          The  current  state  of the investigation. An archived investigation
          indicates that you have completed reviewing the investigation.
