NAME
       list-investigations -

DESCRIPTION
       Detective  investigations  lets you investigate IAM users and IAM roles
       using indicators of compromise. An indicator of compromise (IOC) is  an
       artifact  observed  in or on a network, system, or environment that can
       (with a high level of confidence) identify malicious activity or a  se-
       curity incident. ListInvestigations lists all active Detective investi-
       gations.

       JSON Syntax:

            },
            "EntityArn": {
              "Value": "string"
            },
            "CreatedTime": {
              "StartInclusive": timestamp,

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
