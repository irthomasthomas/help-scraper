GET-CREDENTIALS()                                            GET-CREDENTIALS()



NAME
       get-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a database user name and temporary password with temporary au-
       thorization to log in to Amazon Redshift Serverless.

       By default, the temporary credentials expire in 900  seconds.  You  can
       optionally specify a duration between 900 seconds (15 minutes) and 3600
       seconds (60 minutes).

       The Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role that runs GetCre-
       dentials  must  have  an  IAM policy attached that allows access to all
       necessary actions and resources.

       If the DbName parameter is specified, the IAM policy must allow  access
       to the resource dbname for the specified database name.

OPTIONS
       --custom-domain-name (string)
          The custom domain name associated with the workgroup. The custom do-
          main name or the workgroup name must be included in the request.

       --db-name (string)
          The name of the database to get temporary authorization  to  log  on
          to.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 64 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o Must  contain only uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, under-
            score, plus sign, period (dot), at symbol (@), or hyphen.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Must not contain a colon ( : ) or slash ( / ).

          o Cannot be a reserved word. A list of reserved words can  be  found
            in Reserved Words in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The number of seconds until the returned temporary password expires.
          The minimum is 900 seconds, and the maximum is 3600 seconds.

       --workgroup-name (string)
          The name of the workgroup associated with the database.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       dbPassword -> (string)
          A temporary password that  authorizes  the  user  name  returned  by
          DbUser to log on to the database DbName .

       dbUser -> (string)
          A  database  user  name that is authorized to log on to the database
          DbName using the password DbPassword . If the specified  DbUser  ex-

       nextRefreshTime -> (timestamp)
