LIST-SNAPSHOTS()                                              LIST-SNAPSHOTS()



NAME
       list-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of snapshots.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-snapshots  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: snapshots

SYNOPSIS
            list-snapshots
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--namespace-arn <value>]
          [--namespace-name <value>]
          [--owner-account <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --end-time (timestamp)
          The timestamp showing when the snapshot creation finished.

       --namespace-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the namespace from which  to  list
          all snapshots.

       --namespace-name (string)
          The namespace from which to list all snapshots.

       --owner-account (string)
          The owner Amazon Web Services account of the snapshot.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The time when the creation of the snapshot was initiated.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The

          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
