LIST-USAGE-LIMITS()                                        LIST-USAGE-LIMITS()



NAME
       list-usage-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all usage limits within Amazon Redshift Serverless.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-usage-limits  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: usageLimits

SYNOPSIS
            list-usage-limits
          [--resource-arn <value>]
          [--usage-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with  the  resource  whose
          usage limits you want to list.

       --usage-type (string)
          The Amazon Redshift Serverless feature whose limits you want to see.

          Possible values:

          o serverless-compute

          o cross-region-datasharing

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          When  nextToken  is  returned, there are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.

       usageLimits -> (list)
          An array of returned usage limit objects.

          (structure)
              The usage limit object.

              amount -> (long)
                 The  limit amount. If time-based, this amount is in RPUs con-
                 sumed per hour. If data-based, this amount  is  in  terabytes
                 (TB). The value must be a positive number.

              breachAction -> (string)
                 The  action  that  Amazon  Redshift Serverless takes when the
                 limit is reached.

              period -> (string)
                 The time period that the amount applies to. A  weekly  period
                 begins on Sunday. The default is monthly.

              resourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that identifies the Amazon
                 Redshift Serverless resource.

              usageLimitArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name of the resource associated with  the
                 usage limit.

              usageLimitId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the usage limit.

              usageType -> (string)
                 The Amazon Redshift Serverless feature to limit.
