LIST-RECOVERY-POINTS()                                  LIST-RECOVERY-POINTS()



NAME
       list-recovery-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of recovery points.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recovery-points  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: recoveryPoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-recovery-points
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--namespace-name <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --end-time (timestamp)
          The time when creation of the recovery point finished.

       --namespace-name (string)
          The name of the namespace to list recovery points for.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The time when the recovery point's creation was initiated.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.

       recoveryPoints -> (list)
          The returned recovery point objects.

          (structure)
              The automatically created recovery point of a namespace.  Recov-
              ery points are created every 30 minutes and kept for 24 hours.

              namespaceName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the namespace the recovery point is associated
                 with.

              recoveryPointCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the recovery point is created.

              recoveryPointId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the recovery point.

              totalSizeInMegaBytes -> (double)
                 The  total  size  of  the  data  in  the  recovery  point  in
                 megabytes.

              workgroupName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the workgroup the recovery point is associated
                 with.
