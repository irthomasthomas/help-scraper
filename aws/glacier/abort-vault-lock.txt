ABORT-VAULT-LOCK()                                          ABORT-VAULT-LOCK()



NAME
       abort-vault-lock -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  aborts  the vault locking process if the vault lock is
       not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state  when
       this  operation  is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedEx-
       ception error. Aborting the vault locking  process  removes  the  vault
       lock policy from the specified vault.

       A  vault  lock  is  put into the InProgress state by calling  Initiate-
       VaultLock . A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling   Com-
       pleteVaultLock . You can get the state of a vault lock by calling  Get-
       VaultLock . For more information about the vault locking  process,  see
       Amazon Glacier Vault Lock . For more information about vault lock poli-
       cies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies .

       This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke  this  opera-
       tion multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if
       there is no policy associated with the vault.

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If  you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To abort an in-progress vault lock process

       The following abort-vault-lock example deletes a vault lock policy from
       the specified vault and resets the lock state of the vault lock to  un-
       locked.

          aws glacier abort-vault-lock \
              --account-id - \
              --vault-name MyVaultName

       This command produces no output.

       For  more information, see Abort Vault Lock (DELETE lock-policy) in the
       Amazon Glacier API Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
