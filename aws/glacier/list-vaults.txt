LIST-VAULTS()                                                    LIST-VAULTS()



NAME
       list-vaults -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  lists  all vaults owned by the calling user's account.
       The list returned in the response is ASCII-sorted by vault name.

       By default, this operation returns up to 10 items. If  there  are  more
       vaults to list, the response marker field contains the vault Amazon Re-
       source Name (ARN) at which to continue the list with a new List  Vaults
       request;  otherwise,  the  marker  field  is null . To return a list of
       vaults that begins at a specific vault, set the marker request  parame-
       ter  to the vault ARN you obtained from a previous List Vaults request.
       You can also limit the number of vaults returned  in  the  response  by
       specifying the limit parameter in the request.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  conceptual  information  and  underlying  REST API, see Retrieving
       Vault Metadata in Amazon S3 Glacier  and  List  Vaults  in  the  Amazon
       Glacier Developer Guide .

       list-vaults  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: VaultList

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If  you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The  following  command lists the vaults in the default account and re-
       gion:

          aws glacier list-vaults --account-id -

       Output:

          {
              "VaultList": [
                  {
                      "SizeInBytes": 3178496,
                      "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
                      "LastInventoryDate": "2015-04-07T00:26:19.028Z",
                      "VaultName": "my-vault",
                      "NumberOfArchives": 1,
                      "CreationDate": "2015-04-06T21:23:45.708Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       VaultList -> (list)
          List of vaults.

          (structure)
              Contains the Amazon S3 Glacier response to your request.

              VaultARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault.

              VaultName -> (string)
                 The name of the vault.

              CreationDate -> (string)
                 The  Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date when the vault was
                 created. This value should be a string in the ISO  8601  date
                 format, for example 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

              LastInventoryDate -> (string)
                 The  Universal  Coordinated  Time  (UTC)  date when Amazon S3
                 Glacier completed the last vault inventory. This value should
                 be  a  string  in  the  ISO  8601  date  format,  for example
                 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

              NumberOfArchives -> (long)
                 The number of archives in the vault as of the last  inventory
                 date. This field will return null if an inventory has not yet
                 run on the vault, for example if you just created the vault.

              SizeInBytes -> (long)
                 Total size, in bytes, of the archives in the vault as of  the
                 last inventory date. This field will return null if an inven-
                 tory has not yet run on the vault, for example  if  you  just
                 created the vault.

       Marker -> (string)
          The  vault  ARN  at which to continue pagination of the results. You
          use the marker in another List Vaults request to obtain more  vaults
          in the list.
