DESCRIBE-VAULT()                                              DESCRIBE-VAULT()



NAME
       describe-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation returns information about a vault, including the vault's
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the date the vault was created, the  number
       of  archives it contains, and the total size of all the archives in the
       vault. The number of archives and their total size are as of  the  last
       inventory  generation.  This means that if you add or remove an archive
       from a vault, and then immediately use Describe Vault,  the  change  in
       contents will not be immediately reflected. If you want to retrieve the
       latest inventory of the vault, use  InitiateJob  .  Amazon  S3  Glacier
       generates  vault inventories approximately daily. For more information,
       see Downloading a Vault Inventory in Amazon S3 Glacier .

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However,  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form  specific  actions. For more information, see Access Control Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For conceptual information and  underlying  REST  API,  see  Retrieving
       Vault  Metadata  in  Amazon S3 Glacier and Describe Vault in the Amazon
       Glacier Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves data about a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier describe-vault --vault-name my-vault --account-id -

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       VaultARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vault.

       VaultName -> (string)
          The name of the vault.

       CreationDate -> (string)
          The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date when the  vault  was  cre-
          ated. This value should be a string in the ISO 8601 date format, for
          example 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

       LastInventoryDate -> (string)
          The Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) date  when  Amazon  S3  Glacier
          completed the last vault inventory. This value should be a string in
          the ISO 8601 date format, for example 2012-03-20T17:03:43.221Z .

       NumberOfArchives -> (long)
          The number of archives in the vault as of the last  inventory  date.
          This  field  will return null if an inventory has not yet run on the
          vault, for example if you just created the vault.

       SizeInBytes -> (long)
          Total size, in bytes, of the archives in the vault as  of  the  last
          inventory  date. This field will return null if an inventory has not
          yet run on the vault, for example if you just created the vault.
