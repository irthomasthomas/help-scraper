SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()                        SET-DATA-RETRIEVAL-POLICY()



NAME
       set-data-retrieval-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation sets and then enacts a data retrieval policy in the re-
       gion specified in the PUT request. You can set one  policy  per  region
       for  an  AWS  account.  The policy is enacted within a few minutes of a
       successful PUT operation.

       The set policy operation does not affect retrieval jobs  that  were  in
       progress before the policy was enacted. For more information about data
       retrieval policies, see Amazon Glacier Data Retrieval Policies .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID. This value must match the
          AWS  account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the re-
          quest. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a sin-
          gle '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon Glacier uses the AWS account
          ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request. If  you
          specify your account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the ID.

       --policy (structure)
          The data retrieval policy in JSON format.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  policy  rule. Although this is a list type, currently there
              must be only one rule, which contains a Strategy field  and  op-
              tionally a BytesPerHour field.

              (structure)
                 Data retrieval policy rule.

                 Strategy -> (string)
                     The type of data retrieval policy to set.

                     Valid values: BytesPerHour|FreeTier|None

                 BytesPerHour -> (long)
                     The  maximum  number of bytes that can be retrieved in an
                     hour.

                     This field is required only if the value of the  Strategy
                     field  is  BytesPerHour  . Your PUT operation will be re-
                     jected if the Strategy field is not set  to  BytesPerHour
                     and you set this field.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Rules=[{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long},{Strategy=string,BytesPerHour=long}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Rules": [
              {
                "Strategy": "string",
                "BytesPerHour": long
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command configures a data retrieval policy for the in-use
       account:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy file://data-retrieval-policy.json

       data-retrieval-policy.json is a JSON file in the  current  folder  that
       specifies a data retrieval policy:

          {
            "Rules":[
               {
                   "Strategy":"BytesPerHour",
                   "BytesPerHour":10737418240
                }
             ]
          }

       Amazon  Glacier  requires an account ID argument when performing opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

       The following command sets the data retrieval policy to FreeTier  using
       inline JSON:

          aws glacier set-data-retrieval-policy --account-id - --policy '{"Rules":[{"Strategy":"FreeTier"}]}'

       See  Set  Data Retrieval Policy in the Amazon Glacier API Reference for
       details on the policy format.

OUTPUT
       None
