SET-VAULT-NOTIFICATIONS()                            SET-VAULT-NOTIFICATIONS()



NAME
       set-vault-notifications -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation configures notifications that will be sent when specific
       events happen to a vault. By default, you don't get any notifications.

       To configure vault notifications, send a PUT request to  the  notifica-
       tion-configuration subresource of the vault. The request should include
       a JSON document that provides an Amazon SNS topic and  specific  events
       for  which  you  want  Amazon  S3  Glacier to send notifications to the
       topic.

       Amazon SNS topics must grant permission to the vault to be  allowed  to
       publish  notifications  to the topic. You can configure a vault to pub-
       lish a notification for the following vault events:

       o ArchiveRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when a job that was  ini-
         tiated  for  an  archive  retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ). The
         status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or "Failed". The noti-
         fication  sent  to  the SNS topic is the same output as returned from
         DescribeJob .

       o InventoryRetrievalCompleted This event occurs when  a  job  that  was
         initiated  for  an  inventory retrieval is completed ( InitiateJob ).
         The status of the completed job can be "Succeeded" or  "Failed".  The
         notification  sent  to  the  SNS topic is the same output as returned
         from  DescribeJob .

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However,  AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form  specific  actions. For more information, see Access Control Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For conceptual information and underlying  REST  API,  see  Configuring
       Vault  Notifications  in  Amazon  S3 Glacier and Set Vault Notification
       Configuration in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The AccountId value is the AWS account ID of the account  that  owns
          the  vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally a
          single '- ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses  the  AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If you use an account ID, do not include any hyphens  ('-')  in  the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --vault-notification-config (structure)
          Provides options for specifying notification configuration.

          SNSTopic -> (string)
              The Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic Amazon
              Resource Name (ARN).

          Events -> (list)
              A list of one or more events for which Amazon  S3  Glacier  will
              send a notification to the specified Amazon SNS topic.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopic=string,Events=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopic": "string",
            "Events": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command configures SNS notifications for  a  vault  named
       my-vault:

          aws glacier set-vault-notifications --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --vault-notification-config file://notificationconfig.json

       notificationconfig.json is a JSON file in the current folder that spec-
       ifies an SNS topic and the events to publish:

          {
            "SNSTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:my-vault",
            "Events": ["ArchiveRetrievalCompleted", "InventoryRetrievalCompleted"]
          }

       Amazon Glacier requires an account ID argument when  performing  opera-
       tions, but you can use a hyphen to specify the in-use account.

OUTPUT
       None
