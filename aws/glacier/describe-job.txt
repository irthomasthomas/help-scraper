DESCRIBE-JOB()                                                  DESCRIBE-JOB()



NAME
       describe-job -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  returns  information about a job you previously initi-
       ated, including the job initiation date, the  user  who  initiated  the
       job, the job status code/message and the Amazon SNS topic to notify af-
       ter Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) completes the job. For more information
       about initiating a job, see  InitiateJob .

       NOTE:
          This operation enables you to check the status of your job. However,
          it is strongly recommended that you set up an Amazon SNS  topic  and
          specify  it  in your initiate job request so that Glacier can notify
          the topic after it completes the job.

       A job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Glacier  completes
       the job.

       An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions).
       However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have  any
       permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to per-
       form specific actions. For more information, see Access  Control  Using
       AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) .

       For  more information about using this operation, see the documentation
       for the underlying REST API Describe Job in the Amazon  Glacier  Devel-
       oper Guide .

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  AccountId  value is the AWS account ID of the account that owns
          the vault. You can either specify an AWS account ID or optionally  a
          single  '-  ' (hyphen), in which case Amazon S3 Glacier uses the AWS
          account ID associated with the credentials used to sign the request.
          If  you  use  an account ID, do not include any hyphens ('-') in the
          ID.

       --vault-name (string)
          The name of the vault.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following command retrieves  information  about  an  inventory  re-
       trieval job on a vault named my-vault:

          aws glacier describe-job --account-id - --vault-name my-vault --job-id zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW

       Output:

          {
              "InventoryRetrievalParameters": {
                  "Format": "JSON"
              },
              "VaultARN": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:0123456789012:vaults/my-vault",
              "Completed": false,
              "JobId": "zbxcm3Z_3z5UkoroF7SuZKrxgGoDc3RloGduS7Eg-RO47Yc6FxsdGBgf_Q2DK5Ejh18CnTS5XW4_XqlNHS61dsO4CnMW",

              "StatusCode": "InProgress"
          }

       The  job  ID can be found in the output of aws glacier initiate-job and
       aws glacier list-jobs.  Amazon Glacier requires an account ID  argument
       when  performing  operations,  but  you can use a hyphen to specify the
       in-use account.

          The SHA256 tree hash value for the requested range of an archive. If
          the InitiateJob request for an archive specified a tree-hash aligned
          range, then this field returns a value.

          If  the  whole  archive  is retrieved, this value is the same as the
          ArchiveSHA256TreeHash value.

       RetrievalByteRange -> (string)
          The  retrieved  byte  range  for  archive retrieval jobs in the form
          StartByteValue -EndByteValue . If no range was specified in the  ar-
          chive  retrieval, then the whole archive is retrieved. In this case,
          StartByteValue equals 0 and EndByteValue equals the size of the  ar-
          chive minus 1. For inventory retrieval or select jobs, this field is
          null.
