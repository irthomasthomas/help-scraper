CREATE-POLICY-TEMPLATE()                              CREATE-POLICY-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-policy-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  policy  template.  A  template can use placeholders for the
       principal and resource. A template must be instantiated into  a  policy
       by associating it with specific principals and resources to use for the
       placeholders. That instantiated policy can then be considered in autho-
       rization  decisions.  The  instantiated policy works identically to any
       other policy, except that it is dynamically linked to the template.  If
       the  template  changes,  then any policies that are linked to that tem-
       plate are immediately updated as well.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency  of  the request. This lets you safely retry the request
          without accidentally performing the same operation  a  second  time.
          Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that
          you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We  recommend
          that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --policy-store-id (string)
          The ID of the policy store in which to create the policy template.

       --description (string)
          Specifies a description for the policy template.

       --statement (string)
          Specifies the content that you want to use for the new  policy  tem-
          plate, written in the Cedar policy language.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       policyStoreId -> (string)
          The ID of the policy store that contains the policy template.

       policyTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the new policy template.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the policy template was originally created.

       lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the policy template was most recently updated.
