CREATE-POLICY-TEMPLATE()                              CREATE-POLICY-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-policy-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  policy  template.  A  template can use placeholders for the
       principal and resource. A template must be instantiated into  a  policy
       by associating it with specific principals and resources to use for the
       placeholders. That instantiated policy can then be considered in autho-
       rization  decisions.  The  instantiated policy works identically to any
       other policy, except that it is dynamically linked to the template.  If
       the  template  changes,  then any policies that are linked to that tem-
       plate are immediately updated as well.

       NOTE:
          Verified Permissions is * eventually consistent * . It  can  take  a
          few seconds for a new or changed element to be propagate through the
          service and be visible in the results of other Verified  Permissions
          operations.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. This lets you safely retry  the  request
          without  accidentally  performing  the same operation a second time.
          Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that
          you  also pass the same value for all other parameters. We recommend
          that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services  generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent parameters, the retry fails with  an  IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --policy-store-id (string)
          The ID of the policy store in which to create the policy template.

       --description (string)
          Specifies a description for the policy template.

       --statement (string)
          Specifies  the  content that you want to use for the new policy tem-
          plate, written in the Cedar policy language.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a policy template

       The following create-policy-template example creates a policy  template
       with a statement that contains a placeholder for the principal.

          aws verifiedpermissions create-policy-template \
              --definition file://template1.txt \
              --policy-store-id PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111

       Contents of file template1.txt:

          permit(
              principal in ?principal,
              action == Action::"view",
              resource == Photo::"VacationPhoto94.jpg"
          );

       Output:

          {
              "createdDate": "2023-06-12T20:47:42.804511+00:00",
              "lastUpdatedDate": "2023-06-12T20:47:42.804511+00:00",
              "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111",
              "policyTemplateId": "PTEXAMPLEabcdefg111111"
          }

       For  more  information about policy templates, see Amazon Verified Per-
       missions policy templates  in  the  Amazon  Verified  Permissions  User
       Guide.
