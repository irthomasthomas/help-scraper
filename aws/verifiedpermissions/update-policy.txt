UPDATE-POLICY()                                                UPDATE-POLICY()



NAME
       update-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  a  Cedar static policy in the specified policy store. You can
       change only certain elements of the  UpdatePolicyDefinition  parameter.
       You  can  directly  update  only  static  policies.  To  change  a tem-
       plate-linked policy,  you  must  update  the  template  instead,  using
       UpdatePolicyTemplate .

       NOTE:
          If policy validation is enabled in the policy store, then updating a
          static policy causes Verified Permissions  to  validate  the  policy
          against the schema in the policy store. If the updated static policy
          doesn't pass validation, the operation fails and  the  update  isn't
          stored.

OPTIONS
       --policy-store-id (string)
          Specifies  the  ID of the policy store that contains the policy that
          you want to update.

       --policy-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of the policy that you want to update. To find this
          value, you can use ListPolicies .

       --definition (tagged union structure)
          Specifies the updated policy content that you want to replace on the
          specified policy. The content must be valid  Cedar  policy  language

          o Changing the effect of the policy from permit or forbid .

          o The principal referenced by the policy.

          o The resource referenced by the policy.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: static.

          static -> (structure)
              Contains  details  about  the  updates to be applied to a static
              policy.

              description -> (string)

                     inal content:

       Shorthand Syntax:

          static={description=string,statement=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "static": {
              "description": "string",
              "statement": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
