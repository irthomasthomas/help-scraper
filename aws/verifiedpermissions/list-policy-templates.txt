LIST-POLICY-TEMPLATES()                                LIST-POLICY-TEMPLATES()



NAME
       list-policy-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a paginated list of all policy templates in the specified pol-
       icy store.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policy-templates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: policyTemplates

OPTIONS
       --policy-store-id (string)
          Specifies  the  ID of the policy store that contains the policy tem-
          plates you want to list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available policy templates

       The following list-policy-templates example lists all policy  templates
       in the specified policy store.

          aws verifiedpermissions list-policy-templates \
              --policy-store-id PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111

       Output:

          {
              "policyTemplates": [
                  {
                      "createdDate": "2023-06-12T20:47:42.804511+00:00",
                      "lastUpdatedDate": "2023-06-12T20:47:42.804511+00:00",
                      "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111",
                      "policyTemplateId": "PTEXAMPLEabcdefg111111"
                  }
              ]
          }

       missions policy templates  in  the  Amazon  Verified  Permissions  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  present, this value indicates that more output is available than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request  parameter  in a subsequent call to the operation to get the
          next part of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken
          response  element  comes  back as null . This indicates that this is
          the last page of results.

       policyTemplates -> (list)
          The list of the policy templates in the specified policy store.

          (structure)
              Contains details about a policy template

              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  parameter  for  the
              ListPolicyTemplates operation.

              policyStoreId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier of the policy store that contains the
                 template.

              policyTemplateId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the policy template.

              description -> (string)
                 The description attached to the policy template.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the policy template was created.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the policy template was most  recently
                 updated.
