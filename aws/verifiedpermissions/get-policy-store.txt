OPTIONS
       --policy-store-id (string)
          Specifies  the  ID  of  the  policy  store that you want information
          about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve details about a policy store

       The following get-policy-store example displays  the  details  for  the
       policy store with the specified Id.

          aws verifiedpermissions get-policy-store \
              --policy-store-id PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:verifiedpermissions::123456789012:policy-store/PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111",
              "createdDate": "2023-06-05T20:16:46.225598+00:00",
              "lastUpdatedDate": "2023-06-08T20:40:23.173691+00:00",
              "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111",
              "validationSettings": { "mode": "OFF" }
          }

       For  more  information about policy stores, see Amazon Verified Permis-
       sions policy stores in the Amazon Verified Permissions User Guide.

OUTPUT
       policyStoreId -> (string)
          The ID of the policy store;

       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy store.

       validationSettings -> (structure)
          The current validation settings for the policy store.

          mode -> (string)
              The validation mode currently configured for this policy  store.
              The valid values are:

              o OFF   Neither Verified Permissions nor Cedar perform any vali-
                dation on policies. No validation errors are reported  by  ei-
                ther service.

              o STRICT   Requires  a schema to be present in the policy store.
                Cedar performs validation on  all  submitted  new  or  updated
                static policies and policy templates. Any that fail validation
                are rejected and Cedar doesn't store them in the policy store.

              WARNING:
                 If Mode=STRICT and the policy store doesn't contain a schema,
                 Verified  Permissions  rejects all static policies and policy
                 templates because there is no schema to validate against.

                 To submit a  static  policy  or  policy  template  without  a
                 schema, you must turn off validation.

       createdDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the policy store was originally created.

       lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the policy store was last updated.

       description -> (string)
          Descriptive text that you can provide to help with identification of
          the current policy store.
