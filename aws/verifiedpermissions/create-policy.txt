CREATE-POLICY()                                                CREATE-POLICY()



NAME
       create-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a Cedar policy and saves it in the specified policy store. You
       can create either a static policy or a policy linked to a  policy  tem-
       plate.

       o To create a static policy, provide the Cedar policy text in the Stat-
         icPolicy section of the PolicyDefinition .

       o To create a policy that is dynamically linked to a  policy  template,
         specify  the policy template ID and the principal and resource to as-
         sociate with this policy in the templateLinked section of the Policy-
         Definition  .  If  the  policy template is ever updated, any policies
         linked to the policy template automatically use the updated template.

       NOTE:
          Creating a policy causes it to be validated against  the  schema  in
          the  policy store. If the policy doesn't pass validation, the opera-
          tion fails and the policy isn't stored.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency  of  the request. This lets you safely retry the request
          without accidentally performing the same operation  a  second  time.
          Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that
          you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We  recommend
          that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent  parameters,  the retry fails with an IdempotentParameterMis-
          match error.

       --policy-store-id (string)
          Specifies the PolicyStoreId of the policy store you  want  to  store
          the policy in.

       --definition (tagged union structure)
          A  structure  that  specifies the policy type and content to use for
          the new policy. You must include either a static or a templateLinked
          element. The policy content must be written in the Cedar policy lan-
          guage.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: static, templateLinked.

          static -> (structure)
              A  structure  that  describes  a static policy. An static policy
              doesn't use a template or allow placeholders for entities.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the static policy.

              statement -> (string)
                 The policy content of the static policy, written in the Cedar
                 policy language.

          templateLinked -> (structure)
              A structure that describes a policy that was instantiated from a
              template. The template can specify  placeholders  for  principal
              and resource . When you use CreatePolicy to create a policy from
              a template, you specify the exact principal and resource to  use
              for the instantiated policy.

              policyTemplateId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier of the policy template used to create
                 this policy.

              principal -> (structure)
                 The principal associated with  this  template-linked  policy.
                 Verified  Permissions  substitutes  this  principal  for  the
                 ?principal placeholder in the policy template when it  evalu-
                 ates an authorization request.

                 entityType -> (string)
                     The type of an entity.

                     Example: "entityType":"*typeName* "

                 entityId -> (string)
                     The identifier of an entity.
                        "entityId":"*identifier* "

              resource -> (structure)
                 The  resource  associated  with  this template-linked policy.
                 Verified Permissions substitutes this resource for  the  ?re-
                 source  placeholder  in the policy template when it evaluates
                 an authorization request.

                 entityType -> (string)
                     The type of an entity.

                     Example: "entityType":"*typeName* "

                 entityId -> (string)
                     The identifier of an entity.
                        "entityId":"*identifier* "

       Shorthand Syntax:

          static={description=string,statement=string},templateLinked={policyTemplateId=string,principal={entityType=string,entityId=string},resource={entityType=string,entityId=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "static": {
              "description": "string",
              "statement": "string"
            },
            "templateLinked": {
              "policyTemplateId": "string",
              "principal": {
                "entityType": "string",
                "entityId": "string"
              },
              "resource": {
                "entityType": "string",
                "entityId": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
