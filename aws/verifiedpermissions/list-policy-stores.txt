LIST-POLICY-STORES()                                      LIST-POLICY-STORES()



NAME
       list-policy-stores -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a paginated list of all policy stores in the calling Amazon Web
       Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policy-stores is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: policyStores

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available policy stores

       The following list-policy-stores example lists all policy stores in the
       AWS  Region.  All  commands for Verified Permissions except create-pol-
       icy-store and list-policy-stores require that you specify the Id of the
       policy store you want to work with.

          aws verifiedpermissions list-policy-stores

       Output:

          {
              "policyStores": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:verifiedpermissions::123456789012:policy-store/PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111",
                      "createdDate": "2023-06-05T20:16:46.225598+00:00",
                      "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg111111"
                  },
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:verifiedpermissions::123456789012:policy-store/PSEXAMPLEabcdefg222222",
                      "createdDate": "2023-06-08T18:09:37.364356+00:00",
                      "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg222222"
                  },
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:verifiedpermissions::123456789012:policy-store/PSEXAMPLEabcdefg333333",
                      "createdDate": "2023-06-08T18:09:46.920600+00:00",
                      "policyStoreId": "PSEXAMPLEabcdefg333333"
                  }
              ]
          }

       sions policy stores in the Amazon Verified Permissions User Guide.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.

       policyStores -> (list)
          The list of policy stores in the account.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a policy store.

              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  parameter  for  the
              ListPolicyStores operation.

              policyStoreId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the policy store.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy store.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the policy was created.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the policy store was most recently updated.

              description -> (string)
                 Descriptive text that you can provide to help with  identifi-
                 cation of the current policy store.
