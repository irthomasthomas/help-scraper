LIST-POLICIES()                                                LIST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a paginated list of all policies stored in the specified policy
       store.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: policies

OPTIONS
       --policy-store-id (string)
          Specifies the ID of the policy store you want to list policies from.

       --filter (structure)
          Specifies  a  filter  that limits the response to only policies that
          match the specified criteria. For example, you list only  the  poli-
          cies that reference a specified principal.

          principal -> (tagged union structure)
              Filters the output to only policies that reference the specified
              principal.

              NOTE:
                 This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of  the  following
                 top level keys can be set: unspecified, identifier.

              unspecified -> (boolean)
                 Used  to  indicate that a principal or resource is not speci-
                 fied. This can be used to search for policies  that  are  not
                 associated with a specific principal or resource.

              identifier -> (structure)
                 The identifier of the entity. It can consist of either an En-
                 tityType and EntityId, a principal, or a resource.

                 entityType -> (string)
                     The type of an entity.

                     Example: "entityType":"*typeName* "

                 entityId -> (string)
                     The identifier of an entity.
                        "entityId":"*identifier* "

          resource -> (tagged union structure)
              Filters the output to only policies that reference the specified
              resource.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following
                 top level keys can be set: unspecified, identifier.

              unspecified -> (boolean)
                 Used to indicate that a principal or resource is  not  speci-
                 fied.  This  can  be used to search for policies that are not
                 associated with a specific principal or resource.

              identifier -> (structure)
                 The identifier of the entity. It can consist of either an En-
                 tityType and EntityId, a principal, or a resource.

                 entityType -> (string)
                     The type of an entity.

                     Example: "entityType":"*typeName* "

                 entityId -> (string)
                     The identifier of an entity.
                        "entityId":"*identifier* "

          policyType -> (string)
              Filters the output to only policies of the specified type.

          policyTemplateId -> (string)
              Filters  the  output  to only template-linked policies that were
              instantiated from the specified policy template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          principal={unspecified=boolean,identifier={entityType=string,entityId=string}},resource={unspecified=boolean,identifier={entityType=string,entityId=string}},policyType=string,policyTemplateId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "principal": {
              "unspecified": true|false,
              "identifier": {
                "entityType": "string",
                "entityId": "string"
              }
            },
            "resource": {
              "unspecified": true|false,
              "identifier": {
                "entityType": "string",
                "entityId": "string"
              }
            },
            "policyType": "STATIC"|"TEMPLATE_LINKED",
            "policyTemplateId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If present, this value indicates that more output is available  than
          is included in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken
          request parameter in a subsequent call to the operation to  get  the
          next  part of the output. You should repeat this until the NextToken
          response element comes back as null . This indicates  that  this  is
          the last page of results.

              definition -> (tagged union structure)
                 The  policy definition of an item in the list of policies re-
                 turned.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: static, templateLinked.

                 static -> (structure)
                     Information  about  a  static  policy that wasn't created

                        The principal  associated  with  this  template-linked
                        policy.  Verified Permissions substitutes this princi-
                        pal for the ?principal placeholder in the policy  tem-
                        plate when it evaluates an authorization request.
