CREATE-POLICY-STORE()                                    CREATE-POLICY-STORE()



NAME
       create-policy-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  policy  store. A policy store is a container for policy re-
       sources.

       NOTE:
          Although Cedar supports multiple namespaces ,  Verified  Permissions
          currently supports only one namespace per policy store.

       NOTE:
          Verified  Permissions  is  * eventually consistent * . It can take a
          few seconds for a new or changed element to  propagate  through  the
          service  and be visible in the results of other Verified Permissions
          operations.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Specifies a unique, case-sensitive ID that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency  of  the request. This lets you safely retry the request
          without accidentally performing the same operation  a  second  time.
          Passing the same value to a later call to an operation requires that
          you also pass the same value for all other parameters. We  recommend
          that you use a UUID type of value. .

          If  you don't provide this value, then Amazon Web Services generates
          a random one for you.

          If you retry the operation with the same ClientToken , but with dif-
          ferent parameters, the retry fails with an ConflictException error.

          Verified Permissions recognizes a ClientToken for eight hours. After
          eight hours, the next request with the same parameters performs  the
          operation again regardless of the value of ClientToken .

       --validation-settings (structure)
          Specifies the validation setting for this policy store.

          Currently, the only valid and required value is Mode .

          WARNING:
              We  recommend that you turn on STRICT mode only after you define
              a schema. If a schema doesn't exist, then STRICT mode causes any
              policy  to fail validation, and Verified Permissions rejects the
              policy.   You   can   turn   off   validation   by   using   the
              UpdatePolicyStore  .  Then,  when you have a schema defined, use
              UpdatePolicyStore again to turn validation back on.

          mode -> (string)
              The validation mode currently configured for this policy  store.
              The valid values are:

              o OFF   Neither Verified Permissions nor Cedar perform any vali-
                dation on policies. No validation errors are reported  by  ei-
                ther service.

              o STRICT   Requires  a schema to be present in the policy store.
                Cedar performs validation on  all  submitted  new  or  updated
                static policies and policy templates. Any that fail validation
                are rejected and Cedar doesn't store them in the policy store.

              WARNING:
                 If Mode=STRICT and the policy store doesn't contain a schema,
                 Verified  Permissions  rejects all static policies and policy
                 templates because there is no schema to validate against.

                 To submit a  static  policy  or  policy  template  without  a
                 schema, you must turn off validation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          mode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "mode": "OFF"|"STRICT"
          }

       --description (string)
          Descriptive text that you can provide to help with identification of
          the current policy store.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a policy store

       The following create-policy-store example creates a policy store in the
       current AWS Region.

          aws verifiedpermissions create-policy-store \
              --validation-settings "mode=STRICT"

       Output:
