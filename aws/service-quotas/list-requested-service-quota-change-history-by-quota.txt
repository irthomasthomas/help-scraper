LIST-REQUESTED-SERVICE-QLIST-REQUESTED-SERVICE-QUOTA-CHANGE-HISTORY-BY-QUOTA()



NAME
       list-requested-service-quota-change-history-by-quota -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the quota increase requests for the specified quota.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-requested-service-quota-change-history-by-quota is a paginated op-
       eration. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  en-
       tire  data  set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query expressions: RequestedQuotas

OPTIONS
       --service-code (string)
          Specifies the service identifier. To find the service code value for
          an Amazon Web Services service, use the  ListServices operation.

       --quota-code (string)
          Specifies  the  quota  identifier. To find the quota code for a spe-
          cific quota, use the  ListServiceQuotas operation, and look for  the
          QuotaCode response in the output for the quota you want.

       --status (string)
          Specifies  that  you want to filter the results to only the requests
          with the matching status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o CASE_OPENED

          o APPROVED

          o DENIED

          o CASE_CLOSED

          o NOT_APPROVED

          o INVALID_REQUEST

       --quota-requested-at-level (string)
          Specifies at which level within the Amazon Web Services account  the
          quota request applies to.

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT

          o RESOURCE

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included

          rameter  in  a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .

       RequestedQuotas -> (list)
          Information about the quota increase requests.

                 specific quota, use  the   ListServiceQuotas  operation,  and
                 look  for  the QuotaCode response in the output for the quota
                 you want.

              QuotaName -> (string)
                 Specifies the quota name.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement.

              QuotaRequestedAtLevel -> (string)
                 Specifies  at  which level within the Amazon Web Services ac-

                     vices account, or to a resource.

                 ContextScopeType -> (string)
                     When  the  ContextScope is RESOURCE , then this specifies
                     the resource type of the specified resource.

                 ContextId -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon Web Services account or resource  to
                     which  the quota applies. The value in this field depends
                     on the context scope associated with the  specified  ser-
                     vice quota.
