SYNOPSIS
            create-location-fsx-open-zfs
          --fsx-filesystem-arn <value>
          --protocol <value>
          --security-group-arns <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for OpenZFS file system.

       --protocol (structure)
          The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Represents  the Network File System (NFS) protocol that DataSync
              uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Represents the mount options that are available for  DataSync
                 to access an NFS location.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to
                     mount your NFS share. If the server refuses  to  use  the
                     version specified, the sync will fail. If you don't spec-
                     ify a version, DataSync defaults to AUTOMATIC . That  is,
                     DataSync automatically selects a version based on negoti-
                     ation with the NFS server.

                     You can specify the following NFS versions:

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv3 ** - stateless protocol version that  allows  for
                       asynchronous writes on the server.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 90)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv4.0  ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol ver-
                       sion that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 92)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv4.1 ** - stateful protocol  version  that  supports
                       sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data pro-
                       cessing. Version 4.1 also includes all features  avail-
                       able in version 4.0.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 94)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NFS={MountOptions={Version=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NFS": {
              "MountOptions": {
                "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
              }
            }
          }

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  of the security groups that are used to configure the FSx
          for OpenZFS file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the location's path that must begin  with  /fsx  .
          DataSync  uses this subdirectory to read or write data (depending on
          whether the file system is a source or destination location).

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource.  The  value  can  be an empty string. This value helps you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for OpenZFS file system location  that  you  cre-
          ated.
