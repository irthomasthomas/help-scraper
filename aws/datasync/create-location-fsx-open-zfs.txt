CREATE-LOCATION-FSX-OPEN-ZFS()                  CREATE-LOCATION-FSX-OPEN-ZFS()



NAME
       create-location-fsx-open-zfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a transfer location for an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.
       DataSync can use this location as a source or destination for transfer-
       ring data.

       Before  you  begin, make sure that you understand how DataSync accesses
       FSx for OpenZFS file systems .

       NOTE:
          Request parameters related to SMB aren't supported with the  Create-
          LocationFsxOpenZfs operation.

OPTIONS
       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for OpenZFS file system.

       --protocol (structure)
          The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  Network File System (NFS) protocol configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or
              FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how  DataSync  can access a location using the NFS
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync  to  use
                     when  mounting  your  NFS share. If the server refuses to
                     use the version specified, the task fails.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

                     o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                       chronous writes on the server.

                     o NFSv4_0  : Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version
                       that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     o NFSv4_1 : Stateful protocol version that supports  ses-
                       sions,  directory  delegations,  and parallel data pro-
                       cessing. NFS version 4.1  also  includes  all  features
                       available in version 4.0.

                     NOTE:
                        DataSync  currently  only  supports NFS version 3 with
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

          SMB -> (structure)
              Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol  configuration
              that  DataSync  uses  to access your FSx for ONTAP file system's
              SVM.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of  the  Mi-
                 crosoft  Active  Directory  that your storage virtual machine
                 (SVM) belongs to.

                 If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring
                 this  setting  makes sure that DataSync connects to the right
                 SVM.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB)  pro-
                 tocol that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

                 Version -> (string)
                     By  default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB proto-
                     col version based  on  negotiation  with  your  SMB  file
                     server. You also can configure DataSync to use a specific
                     SMB version, but we recommend doing this only if DataSync
                     has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server automat-
                     ically.

                     These are the following options for configuring  the  SMB
                     version:

                     o AUTOMATIC  (default):  DataSync and the SMB file server
                       negotiate the highest version of SMB that they mutually
                       support  between 2.1 and 3.1.1. This is the recommended
                       option. If you instead choose a specific  version  that
                       your file server doesn't support, you may get an Opera-
                       tion Not Supported error.

                     o SMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to  only  SMB
                       version 3.0.2.

                     o SMB2  :  Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB
                       version 2.1.

                     o SMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB
                       version 2.0.

                     o SMB1  :  Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB
                       version 1.0.

                     NOTE:
                        The SMB1 option isn't available when creating an  Ama-
                        zon FSx for NetApp ONTAP location .

              Password -> (string)
                 Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access
                 your SVM.

              User -> (string)
                 Specifies a user that can mount and access the  files,  fold-
                 ers, and metadata in your SVM.

                 For information about choosing a user with the right level of
                 access for your transfer, see Using the SMB protocol .

          }

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the security groups that are used to configure  the  FSx
          for OpenZFS file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subdirectory (string)
          A  subdirectory  in  the location's path that must begin with /fsx .
          DataSync uses this subdirectory to read or write data (depending  on
          whether the file system is a source or destination location).

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource. The value can be an empty string.  This  value  helps  you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair representing a single tag that's  been  applied
              to an Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
