       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-location-fsx-open-zfs
          --fsx-filesystem-arn <value>
          --protocol <value>
          --security-group-arns <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for OpenZFS file system.

       --protocol (structure)
          The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  Network File System (NFS) protocol configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or
              FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how  DataSync  can access a location using the NFS
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync  to  use
                     when  mounting  your  NFS share. If the server refuses to
                     use the version specified, the task fails.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

                     o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                       chronous writes on the server.

                     o NFSv4_0  : Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version
                       that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     o NFSv4_1 : Stateful protocol version that supports  ses-
                       sions,  directory  delegations,  and parallel data pro-
                       cessing. NFS version 4.1  also  includes  all  features
                       available in version 4.0.

                     NOTE:
                        DataSync  currently  only  supports NFS version 3 with
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

          SMB -> (structure)
              Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol  configuration
              that  DataSync  uses  to access your FSx for ONTAP file system's
              SVM.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of  the  Mi-
                 crosoft  Active  Directory  that your storage virtual machine
                 (SVM) belongs to.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies how DataSync can access a location  using  the  SMB
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  SMB version that you want DataSync to use
                     when mounting your SMB share. If you don't specify a ver-
                     sion,  DataSync  defaults to AUTOMATIC and chooses a ver-
                     sion based on negotiation with the SMB server.

              Password -> (string)
                 Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access
                 your SVM.

              User -> (string)
                 Specifies a user who has permission to access your SVM.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NFS={MountOptions={Version=string}},SMB={Domain=string,MountOptions={Version=string},Password=string,User=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NFS": {
              "MountOptions": {
                "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
              }
            },
            "SMB": {
              "Domain": "string",
              "MountOptions": {
                "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"
              },
              "Password": "string",
              "User": "string"
            }
          }

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  of the security groups that are used to configure the FSx
          for OpenZFS file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the location's path that must begin  with  /fsx  .
          DataSync  uses this subdirectory to read or write data (depending on
          whether the file system is a source or destination location).

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource.  The  value  can  be an empty string. This value helps you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for OpenZFS file system location  that  you  cre-
          ated.
