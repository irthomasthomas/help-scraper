OPTIONS
       --discovery-job-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the discovery job that's
          collecting data from your on-premises storage system.

       --resource-type (string)
          Specifies what kind of storage system resources that you want infor-
          mation about.

          Possible values:

          o SVM

          o VOLUME

          o CLUSTER

       --resource-ids (list)
          Specifies the universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) of the  storage
          system resources that you want information about. You can't use this
          parameter in combination with the Filter parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filter (map)
          Filters the storage system resources that you want returned. For ex-
          ample, this might be volumes associated with a specific storage vir-
          tual machine (SVM).

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

          Where valid key names are:
            SVM

       JSON Syntax:

          {"SVM": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of storage system  resources  that  you
          want to list in a response.

       --next-token (string)
          Specifies  an opaque string that indicates the position to begin the
          next list of results in the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
