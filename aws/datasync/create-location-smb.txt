CREATE-LOCATION-SMB()                                    CREATE-LOCATION-SMB()



NAME
       create-location-smb -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  transfer  location  for  a  Server Message Block (SMB) file
       server. DataSync can use this location as a source or  destination  for
       transferring data.

       Before  you  begin, make sure that you understand how DataSync accesses
       SMB file servers .

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies the name of the share exported by  your  SMB  file  server
          where  DataSync will read or write data. You can include a subdirec-
          tory in the share path (for example, /path/to/subdirectory  ).  Make
          sure  that  other  SMB  clients  in your network can also mount this
          path.

          To copy all data in the subdirectory, DataSync must be able to mount
          the  SMB share and access all of its data. For more information, see
          required permissions for SMB locations.

       --server-hostname (string)
          Specifies the Domain Name Service (DNS) name or IP  address  of  the
          SMB file server that your DataSync agent will mount.

          NOTE:
              You can't specify an IP version 6 (IPv6) address.

       --user (string)
          Specifies the user that can mount and access the files, folders, and
          file metadata in your SMB file server.

          For information about choosing a user with the right level of access
          for your transfer, see required permissions for SMB locations.

       --domain (string)
          Specifies the name of the Active Directory domain that your SMB file
          server belongs to.

          If you have multiple Active Directory domains in  your  environment,
          configuring  this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the
          right file server.

       --password (string)
          Specifies the password of the user  who  can  mount  your  SMB  file
          server  and  has permission to access the files and folders involved
          in your transfer.

          For more information, see required permissions for SMB locations.

       --agent-arns (list)
          Specifies the DataSync agent (or agents) which you want  to  connect
          to  your  SMB  file server. You specify an agent by using its Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --mount-options (structure)
          Specifies the version of the SMB protocol that DataSync uses to  ac-
          cess your SMB file server.

          Version -> (string)
              By  default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol ver-
              sion based on negotiation with your SMB file  server.  You  also
              can  configure  DataSync  to  use a specific SMB version, but we
              recommend doing this only if DataSync  has  trouble  negotiating
              with the SMB file server automatically.

              These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

              o AUTOMATIC  (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negoti-
                ate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support  be-
                tween  2.1  and  3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you
                instead choose  a  specific  version  that  your  file  server
                doesn't support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.

              o SMB3  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                3.0.2.

              o SMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                2.1.

              o SMB2_0  :  Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB ver-
                sion 2.0.

              o SMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                1.0.

              NOTE:
                 The  SMB1  option isn't available when creating an Amazon FSx
                 for NetApp ONTAP location .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"|"SMB1"|"SMB2_0"
          }

       --tags (list)
          Specifies labels that help you categorize, filter,  and  search  for
          your Amazon Web Services resources. We recommend creating at least a
          name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair representing a single tag that's  been  applied
              to an Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
