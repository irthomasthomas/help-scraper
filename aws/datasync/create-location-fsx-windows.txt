OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies a mount path for your file system using  forward  slashes.
          This is where DataSync reads or writes data (depending on if this is
          a source or destination location).

       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  FSx  for  Windows
          File Server file system.

       --security-group-arns (list)
          Specifies  the  ARNs  of  the security groups that provide access to
          your file system's preferred subnet.

          NOTE:
              If you choose a security group that  doesn't  allow  connections
              from within itself, do one of the following:

              o Configure the security group to allow it to communicate within
                itself.

              o Choose a different security group that  can  communicate  with
                the mount target's security group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  labels  that  help you categorize, filter, and search for
          your Amazon Web Services resources. We recommend creating at least a
          name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --user (string)
          Specifies the user who has the permissions to access files and fold-
          ers in the file system.

          For information about choosing a user name that  ensures  sufficient
          permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .

       --domain (string)
          Specifies  the  name  of the Windows domain that the FSx for Windows
          File Server belongs to.

       --password (string)
          Specifies the password of the user who has the permissions to access
          files and folders in the file system.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for Windows File Server file system location  you
          created.
