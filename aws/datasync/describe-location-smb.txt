OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB location to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the SMB location that was de-
          scribed.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the source SMB location that was described.

       AgentArns -> (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source SMB file  system  loca-
          tion that is created.

          (string)

       User -> (string)
          The  user  who  can  mount  the share, has the permissions to access
          files and folders in the SMB share.

       Domain -> (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The mount options that are available for DataSync to use  to  access
          an SMB location.

          Version -> (string)
              By  default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol ver-
              sion based on negotiation with your SMB file  server.  You  also
              can  configure  DataSync  to  use a specific SMB version, but we
              recommend doing this only if DataSync  has  trouble  negotiating
              with the SMB file server automatically.

              These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

              o AUTOMATIC  (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negoti-
                ate a protocol version that they mutually  support.  (DataSync
                supports  SMB versions 1.0 and later.) This is the recommended
                option. If you instead choose a  specific  version  that  your
                file server doesn't support, you may get an Operation Not Sup-
                ported error.

              o SMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                3.0.2.

              o SMB2  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                2.1.

              o SMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only  SMB  ver-
                sion 2.0.

              o SMB1  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                1.0.

              NOTE:
                 The SMB1 option isn't available when creating an  Amazon  FSx
                 for NetApp ONTAP location .

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the SMB location was created.
