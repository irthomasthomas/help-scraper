OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  SMB  location  that
          you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the SMB location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URI of the SMB location.

       AgentArns -> (list)
          The ARNs of the DataSync agents that can connect with your SMB  file
          server.

          (string)

       User -> (string)
          The  user  that  can  mount  and access the files, folders, and file
          metadata in your SMB file server.

       Domain -> (string)
          The name of the Microsoft Active Directory domain that the SMB  file
          server belongs to.

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The protocol that DataSync use to access your SMB file.

          Version -> (string)
              By  default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol ver-
              sion based on negotiation with your SMB file  server.  You  also
              can  configure  DataSync  to  use a specific SMB version, but we
              recommend doing this only if DataSync  has  trouble  negotiating
              with the SMB file server automatically.

              These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

              o AUTOMATIC  (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negoti-
                ate the highest version of SMB that they mutually support  be-
                tween  2.1  and  3.1.1. This is the recommended option. If you
                instead choose  a  specific  version  that  your  file  server
                doesn't support, you may get an Operation Not Supported error.

              o SMB3  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                3.0.2.

              o SMB2 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                2.1.

              o SMB2_0  :  Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB ver-
                sion 2.0.

              o SMB1 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                1.0.

              NOTE:
                 The  SMB1  option isn't available when creating an Amazon FSx
                 for NetApp ONTAP location .

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the SMB location was created.
