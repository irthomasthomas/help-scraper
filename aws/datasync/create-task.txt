CREATE-TASK()                                                    CREATE-TASK()



NAME
       create-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  a task, which defines where and how DataSync transfers your
       data.

       A task includes a source location,  a  destination  location,  and  the
       preferences  for  how  and when you want to transfer your data (such as
       bandwidth limits, scheduling, among other options).

       WARNING:
          If you're planning to transfer data to or from an  Amazon  S3  loca-
          tion, review how DataSync can affect your S3 request charges and the
          DataSync pricing page before you begin.

OPTIONS
       --source-location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source location for the task.

       --destination-location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Web Services storage re-
          source's location.

       --cloud-watch-log-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group
          that is used to monitor and log events in the task.

       --name (string)
          The name of a task. This value is a text reference that is  used  to
          identify the task in the console.

       --options (structure)
          Specifies the configuration options for a task. Some options include
          preserving file or object metadata and verifying data integrity.

          You can also override these options before  starting  an  individual
          run  of  a task (also known as a task execution ). For more informa-
          tion, see StartTaskExecution .

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how and when DataSync checks  the  integrity  of  your
              data during a transfer.

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT
                 ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): DataSync calculates the
                 checksum of transferred files and metadata at the source  lo-
                 cation.  At  the  end of the transfer, DataSync then compares
                 this checksum to the checksum calculated on  those  files  at
                 the destination.

              We  recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexi-
              ble Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive  storage  classes.  For
              more  information,  see Storage class considerations with Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT : At the end of the transfer,  Data-
                 Sync  scans  the entire source and destination to verify that
                 both locations are fully synchronized.

              You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexi-
              ble  Retrieval  or  S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For
              more information, see Storage class considerations  with  Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 NONE  :  DataSync  doesn't run additional verification at the
                 end of the transfer. All data transmissions are still  integ-
                 rity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  data  at  the destination location should be
              overwritten or preserved. If set to NEVER , a  destination  file
              for  example  will not be replaced by a source file (even if the
              destination file differs from the source file).  If  you  modify
              files  in  the  destination  and you sync the files, you can use
              this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some storage classes have specific  behaviors  that  can  affect
              your  Amazon  S3  storage  cost.  For  detailed information, see
              Considerations when working with Amazon S3  storage  classes  in
              DataSync .

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              a file was read or written to. If you set Atime to BEST_EFFORT ,
              DataSync  attempts  to  preserve the original Atime attribute on
              all source files (that is,  the  version  before  the  PREPARING
              phase of the task execution).

              NOTE:
                 The  behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT
                 BEST_EFFORT : Attempt to preserve the  per-file  Atime  value
                 (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Atime  is  set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be set to PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last  time
              that  a  file  was written to before the PREPARING phase of your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              Default Value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

                 NONE : Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer  value  of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE  :  Preserve  the integer value of UID and group ID
                 (GID) (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer  value  of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE  :  Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and
                 GID (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies whether files in the destination location  that  don't
              exist  in the source should be preserved. This option can affect
              your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes  objects,  you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Ignore such destination files (recommended).

                 REMOVE  :  Delete destination files that arent present in the
                 source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode  to  ALL  . When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't
                 scan your destination  location  and  doesn't  know  what  to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and character devices in the source location  and  recreate  the
              files  with  that  device  name and metadata on the destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices  be-
                 cause  they're  nonterminal  and  don't return an end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE
                 NONE : Ignore special devices (recommended).

                 PRESERVE : Preserve character and block device metadata. This
                 option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits  the  bandwidth  used by a DataSync task. For example, if
              you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set  this  value  to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during certain scenarios when running multiple tasks .  This  is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group,  see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              If  you  set LogLevel to OFF , no logs are published. BASIC pub-
              lishes logs on errors for individual files transferred. TRANSFER
              publishes  logs for every file or object that is transferred and
              integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
              that  differ  between the source and the destination location or
              transfers all the content from  the  source  (without  comparing
              what's in the destination).
                 CHANGED  :  DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new
                 or different content from the source location to the destina-
                 tion location.

                 ALL : DataSync copies all source location content to the des-
                 tination (without comparing what's in the destination).

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies which components of the SMB  security  descriptor  are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File  Server  locations.  For more information, see how DataSync
              handles metadata .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't copy
                NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this option.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which  deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to ac-
                cess a secured object. Copying SACLs requires  granting  addi-
                tional  permissions  to the Windows user that DataSync uses to
                access your SMB location. For  information  about  choosing  a
                user  that  ensures  sufficient permissions to files, folders,
                and metadata, see user .
                 NONE : None of the SMB  security  descriptor  components  are
                 copied.  Destination  objects  are owned by the user that was
                 provided for accessing the destination  location.  DACLs  and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  object  tags are preserved when transferring
              between object storage systems. If you want your  DataSync  task
              to ignore object tags, specify the NONE value.

              Default Value: PRESERVE

              Tags  are  key-value  pairs  that  help  you manage, filter, and
              search for your DataSync resources.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair representing a single tag that's  been  applied

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
