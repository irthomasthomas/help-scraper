LIST-LOCATIONS()                                              LIST-LOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-locations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of source and destination locations.

       If  you  have  more locations than are returned in a response (that is,
       the response returns only a truncated list of  your  agents),  the  re-
       sponse  contains  a  token that you can specify in your next request to
       fetch the next page of locations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-locations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Locations

SYNOPSIS
            list-locations
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          You  can  use  API  filters to narrow down the list of resources re-
          turned by ListLocations . For example, to retrieve all  tasks  on  a
          specific source location, you can use ListLocations with filter name
          LocationType S3 and Operator Equals .

          (structure)
              You can use API filters to narrow down the list of resources re-
              turned by ListLocations . For example, to retrieve all your Ama-
              zon S3 locations, you can use ListLocations with filter name Lo-
              cationType S3 and Operator Equals .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the filter being used. Each API call supports a
                 list of filters that are available for it (for example, Loca-
                 tionType for ListLocations ).

              Values -> (list)
                 The  values  that  you  want  to filter for. For example, you
                 might want to display only Amazon S3 locations.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator that is used to compare filter values (for exam-
                 ple, Equals or Contains ). For more about API filtering oper-
                 ators, see API filters for ListTasks and ListLocations .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "LocationUri"|"LocationType"|"CreationTime",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equals"|"NotEquals"|"In"|"LessThanOrEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThanOrEqual"|"GreaterThan"|"Contains"|"NotContains"|"BeginsWith"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Locations -> (list)
          An array that contains a list of locations.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in a list of  locations.  LocationLis-
              tEntry  returns  an array that contains a list of locations when
              the ListLocations operation is called.

              LocationArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the location.  For  Network
                 File  System  (NFS) or Amazon EFS, the location is the export
                 path. For Amazon S3, the location is the prefix path that you
                 want to mount and use as the root of the location.

              LocationUri -> (string)
                 Represents  a list of URIs of a location. LocationUri returns
                 an  array  that  contains  a  list  of  locations  when   the
                 ListLocations operation is called.

                 Format: TYPE://GLOBAL_ID/SUBDIR .

                 TYPE  designates the type of location (for example, nfs or s3
                 ).

                 GLOBAL_ID is the globally unique identifier of  the  resource
                 that   backs   the   location.   An   example   for   EFS  is
                 us-east-2.fs-abcd1234 . An  example  for  Amazon  S3  is  the
                 bucket name, such as myBucket . An example for NFS is a valid
                 IPv4 address or a hostname that is compliant with Domain Name
                 Service (DNS).

                 SUBDIR  is  a  valid  file  system path, delimited by forward
                 slashes as is the
                 *
                 nix convention. For NFS and Amazon EFS, it's the export  path
                 to  mount  the  location. For Amazon S3, it's the prefix path
                 that you mount to and treat as the root of the location.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 224)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An opaque string that indicates the position at which to  begin  re-
          turning the next list of locations.
