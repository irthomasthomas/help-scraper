OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB location to update.

       --subdirectory (string)
          The  subdirectory  in  the SMB file system that is used to read data
          from the SMB source location or write data to the  SMB  destination.
          The  SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server, or
          a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can  be
          mounted by other SMB clients in your network.

          NOTE:
              Subdirectory  must  be specified with forward slashes. For exam-
              ple, /path/to/folder .

          To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified,  DataSync
          must  have  permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the
          data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:

          o Ensure that the user/password specified belongs to  the  user  who
            can  mount  the  share and who has the appropriate permissions for
            all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access.

          o Use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount
            the share.

          Doing  either of these options enables the agent to access the data.
          For the agent to access directories, you must also enable  all  exe-
          cute access.

       --user (string)
          The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files
          and folders in the SMB share.

       --domain (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions
          to access files and folders in the SMB share.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Mes-
          sage Block (SMB) location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --mount-options (structure)
          Specifies the version of the Server  Message  Block  (SMB)  protocol
          that DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

          Version -> (string)
              By  default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol ver-
              sion based on negotiation with your SMB file  server.  You  also
              can  configure  DataSync  to  use a specific SMB version, but we
              recommend doing this only if DataSync  has  trouble  negotiating
              with the SMB file server automatically.

              These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

              o AUTOMATIC  (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negoti-
                ate a protocol version that they mutually  support.  (DataSync
                supports  SMB versions 1.0 and later.) This is the recommended
                option. If you instead choose a  specific  version  that  your
                file server doesn't support, you may get an Operation Not Sup-
                ported error.

              o SMB3 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB  version
                3.0.2.

              o SMB2  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                2.1.

              o SMB2_0 : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only  SMB  ver-
                sion 2.0.

              o SMB1  : Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version
                1.0.

              NOTE:
                 The SMB1 option isn't available when creating an  Amazon  FSx
                 for NetApp ONTAP location .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"|"SMB1"|"SMB2_0"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
