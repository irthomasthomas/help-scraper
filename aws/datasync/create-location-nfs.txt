NAME
       create-location-nfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines a file system on a Network File System (NFS) server that can be
       read from or written to.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-location-nfs
          --subdirectory <value>
          --server-hostname <value>
          --on-prem-config <value>
          [--mount-options <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used  to  read  data
          from  the  NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination.
          The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server,  or
          a  subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
          mounted by other NFS clients in your network.

          To see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "showmount  -e
          nfs-server-name " from an NFS client that has access to your server.
          You can specify any directory that appears in the results,  and  any
          subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is acces-
          sible without Kerberos authentication.

          To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs
          to  have  permissions  to  read all the data. To ensure this, either
          configure the NFS export with no_root_squash,  or  ensure  that  the
          permissions  for  all of the files that you want DataSync allow read
          access for all users. Doing either enables the  agent  to  read  the
          files.  For  the  agent to access directories, you must additionally
          enable all execute access.

          If you are copying data to or from your  Snowcone  device,  see  NFS
          Server on Snowcone for more information.

          For  information  about  NFS  export  configuration,  see  18.7. The
          /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux doc-
          umentation.

       --server-hostname (string)
          The  name  of the NFS server. This value is the IP address or Domain
          Name Service (DNS) name of the NFS server.  An  agent  that  is  in-
          stalled  on-premises uses this hostname to mount the NFS server in a
          network.

          If you are copying data to or from your  Snowcone  device,  see  NFS
          Server on Snowcone for more information.

          NOTE:
              This  name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP version
              4 (IPv4) address.

       --on-prem-config (structure)
          Contains a list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents  that  are
          used to connect to an NFS server.

          If  you  are  copying  data to or from your Snowcone device, see NFS
          Server on Snowcone for more information.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AgentArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AgentArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --mount-options (structure)
          The NFS mount options that DataSync can use to mount your NFS share.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies the NFS version that you want  DataSync  to  use  when
              mounting  your  NFS share. If the server refuses to use the ver-
              sion specified, the task fails.

              You can specify the following options:

              o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

              o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous
                writes on the server.

              o NFSv4_0  :  Stateful,  firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o NFSv4_1 : Stateful protocol version  that  supports  sessions,
                directory  delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS ver-
                sion 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync currently only supports NFS version  3  with  Amazon
                 FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair that represents the tag that you want to add to
          the location. The value can be an empty string. We  recommend  using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source NFS file  system  loca-
          tion that is created.
