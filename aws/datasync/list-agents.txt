LIST-AGENTS()                                                    LIST-AGENTS()



NAME
       list-agents -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of DataSync agents that belong to an Amazon Web Services
       account in the Amazon Web Services Region specified in the request.

       With pagination, you can reduce the number of agents returned in a  re-
       sponse.  If  you  get a truncated list of agents in a response, the re-
       sponse contains a marker that you can specify in your next  request  to
       fetch the next page of agents.
          ListAgents  is  eventually consistent. This means the result of run-
          ning the operation might  not  reflect  that  you  just  created  or
          deleted  an  agent.  For  example,  if  you  create  an  agent  with
          CreateAgent and then immediately run ListAgents , that  agent  might
          not show up in the list right away. In situations like this, you can
          always confirm whether an agent has been created (or deleted) by us-
          ing DescribeAgent .

       list-agents  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Agents

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Agents -> (list)
          A list of DataSync agents in your Amazon Web Services account in the
          Amazon Web Services Region specified in the request. The list is or-
          dered by the agents' Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single  entry  in  a  list (or array) of DataSync
              agents when you call the ListAgents operation.

              AgentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a DataSync agent.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of an agent.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of an agent.

                 o If the status is ONLINE , the agent is configured  properly
                   and ready to use.

                 o If  the  status is OFFLINE , the agent has been out of con-
                   tact with DataSync for five minutes  or  longer.  This  can
                   happen for a few reasons. For more information, see What do
                   I do if my agent is offline?

              Platform -> (structure)
                 The platform-related details about the  agent,  such  as  the
                 version number.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The version of the DataSync agent.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The opaque string that indicates the position to begin the next list
          of results in the response.
