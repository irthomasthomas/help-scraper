LIST-TASKS()                                                      LIST-TASKS()



NAME
       list-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the DataSync tasks you created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tasks  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Tasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-tasks
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          You can use API filters to narrow down the  list  of  resources  re-
          turned  by  ListTasks . For example, to retrieve all tasks on a spe-
          cific source location, you can use ListTasks with filter name  Loca-
          tionId and Operator Equals with the ARN for the location.

          (structure)
              You can use API filters to narrow down the list of resources re-
              turned by ListTasks . For example, to retrieve all  tasks  on  a
              source  location,  you  can use ListTasks with filter name Loca-
              tionId and Operator Equals with the ARN for the location.

              For more information, see filtering DataSync resources .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter being used. Each API call  supports  a
                 list of filters that are available for it. For example, Loca-
                 tionId for ListTasks .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values that you want to  filter  for.  For  example,  you
                 might  want  to display only tasks for a specific destination
                 location.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The operator that is used to compare filter values (for exam-
                 ple, Equals or Contains ).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "LocationId"|"CreationTime",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equals"|"NotEquals"|"In"|"LessThanOrEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThanOrEqual"|"GreaterThan"|"Contains"|"NotContains"|"BeginsWith"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tasks -> (list)
          A list of all the tasks that are returned.

          (structure)
              Represents  a single entry in a list of tasks. TaskListEntry re-
              turns an array that contains a list of tasks when the  ListTasks
              operation  is called. A task includes the source and destination
              file systems to sync and the options to use for the tasks.

              TaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the task.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the task.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An opaque string that indicates the position at which to  begin  re-
          turning the next list of tasks.
