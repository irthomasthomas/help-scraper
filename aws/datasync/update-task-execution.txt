UPDATE-TASK-EXECUTION()                                UPDATE-TASK-EXECUTION()



NAME
       update-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the configuration of a running DataSync task execution.

       NOTE:
          Currently, the only Option that you can modify with UpdateTaskExecu-
          tion is `` BytesPerSecond `` , which throttles bandwidth for a  run-
          ning or queued task execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution that
          you're updating.

       --options (structure)
          Indicates how your transfer task is configured.  These  options  in-
          clude  how  DataSync  handles  files,  objects, and their associated
          metadata during your transfer. You also can specify  how  to  verify
          data  integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other op-
          tions.

          Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't  have
          to configure any option before calling StartTaskExecution .

          You also can override your task options for each task execution. For
          example, you might want to adjust the LogLevel for an individual ex-
          ecution.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  and  when  DataSync checks the integrity of your
              data during a transfer.

              o ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended) - DataSync calculates the
                checksum of transferred files and metadata at the source loca-
                tion. At the end of the transfer, DataSync then compares  this
                checksum to the checksum calculated on those files at the des-
                tination. We recommend this option  when  transferring  to  S3
                Glacier  Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
                classes. For more information, see  Storage  class  considera-
                tions with Amazon S3 locations .

              o POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT  (default) - At the end of the trans-
                fer, DataSync scans the entire source and destination to  ver-
                ify  that  both locations are fully synchronized. If you use a
                manifest , DataSync only scans and verifies what's  listed  in
                the  manifest.  You can't use this option when transferring to
                S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive stor-
                age classes. For more information, see Storage class consider-
                ations with Amazon S3 locations .

              o NONE - DataSync doesn't run additional verification at the end
                of  the  transfer.  All  data  transmissions  are still integ-
                rity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the
              destination location.

              o ALWAYS  (default)  - DataSync modifies data in the destination
                location when source data (including metadata) has changed. If
                DataSync   overwrites  objects,  you  might  incur  additional
                charges for certain Amazon S3 storage  classes  (for  example,
                for  retrieval  or  early deletion). For more information, see
                Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers .

              o NEVER - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination lo-
                cation  even  if the source data has changed. You can use this
                option to protect against overwriting changes made to files or
                objects in the destination.

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              a file was read or written to.

              NOTE:
                 The behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across  platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              o BEST_EFFORT  (default)  -  DataSync  attempts  to preserve the
                original Atime attribute on all source  files  (that  is,  the
                version  before  the  PREPARING  phase of the task execution).
                This option is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be  set  to  PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              that a file was written to before the PREPARING  phase  of  your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              o PRESERVE (default) - Preserves original Mtime , which is  rec-
                ommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              o INT_VALUE (default) - Preserves the integer value of  UID  and
                group ID (GID), which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              o INT_VALUE  (default)  - Preserves the integer value of user ID
                (UID) and GID, which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies whether files in the destination location  that  don't
              exist  in the source should be preserved. This option can affect
              your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes  objects,  you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is
                recommended.

              o REMOVE - Deletes destination files that arent present  in  the
                source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode to ALL . When you transfer all  data,  DataSync  doesn't
                 scan  your  destination  location  and  doesn't  know what to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and  character  devices  in the source location and recreate the
              files with that device name and  metadata  on  the  destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't copy the actual contents of these devices be-
                 cause they're nonterminal and  don't  return  an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              o NONE (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).

              o PRESERVE - Preserves character and block device metadata. This
                option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which
                is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits  the  bandwidth  used by a DataSync task. For example, if
              you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set  this  value  to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during certain scenarios when running multiple tasks .  This  is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group,  see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              o BASIC  -  Publishes  logs with only basic information (such as
                transfer errors).

              o TRANSFER - Publishes logs for all files or objects  that  your
                DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.

              o OFF - No logs are published.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
              that differ between the source and the destination  location  or
              transfers  all  the  content  from the source (without comparing
              what's in the destination).

              o CHANGED (default) - DataSync copies only data or metadata that
                is  new  or  different content from the source location to the
                destination location.

              o ALL - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destina-
                tion without comparing differences between the locations.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies  which  components  of the SMB security descriptor are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File Server locations. For more information,  see  how  DataSync
              handles metadata .

              o OWNER_DACL (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies
                the following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't
                  copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this  op-
                  tion.

              o OWNER_DACL_SACL  - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object.

                o SACLs,  which  are used by administrators to log attempts to
                  access a secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting ad-
                  ditional  permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses
                  to access your SMB location. For information about  choosing
                  a  user with the right permissions, see required permissions
                  for SMB , FSx for Windows File Server ,  or  FSx  for  ONTAP
                  (depending on the type of location in your transfer).

              o NONE  -  None  of  the  SMB security descriptor components are
                copied. Destination objects are owned by  the  user  that  was
                provided  for  accessing  the  destination location. DACLs and
                SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want DataSync to PRESERVE object tags (de-
              fault  behavior)  when  transferring between object storage sys-
              tems. If you want your DataSync  task  to  ignore  object  tags,
              specify the NONE value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
