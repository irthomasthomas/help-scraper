OPTIONS
       --task-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transfer  task  that
          you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TaskArn -> (string)
          The ARN of your task.

       Status -> (string)
          The  status  of  your  task.  For information about what each status
          means, see Task statuses .

       Name -> (string)
          The name of your task.

       CurrentTaskExecutionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the most recent task execution.

       SourceLocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of your transfer's source location.

       DestinationLocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of your transfer's destination location.

       CloudWatchLogGroupArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon CloudWatch log group for
          monitoring your task.

          For  more information, see Monitoring data transfers with CloudWatch
          Logs .

       SourceNetworkInterfaceArns -> (list)
          The ARNs of the network interfaces that DataSync  created  for  your
          source location.

          (string)

       DestinationNetworkInterfaceArns -> (list)
          The  ARNs  of  the network interfaces that DataSync created for your
          destination location.

          (string)

       Options -> (structure)
          The task's settings. For example, what file metadata gets preserved,
          how  data integrity gets verified at the end of your transfer, band-
          width limits, among other options.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies if and how DataSync checks the integrity of your  data
              at the end of your transfer.

              o ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended) - DataSync calculates the
                checksum of  transferred  data  (including  metadata)  at  the
                source  location.  At  the  end of the transfer, DataSync then
                compares this checksum to the checksum calculated on that data
                at the destination.

              NOTE:
                     This is the default option for Enhanced mode tasks .

                 We  recommend  this  option  when  transferring to S3 Glacier
                 Flexible  Retrieval  or  S3  Glacier  Deep  Archive   storage
                 classes.  For  more information, see Storage class considera-
                 tions with Amazon S3 locations .

              o POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT - At the end of the  transfer,  Data-
                Sync  checks  the entire source and destination to verify that
                both locations are fully synchronized.

              NOTE:
                     The is the default option for Basic mode tasks and  isn't
                     currently supported with Enhanced mode tasks.

                 If  you  use  a  manifest  , DataSync only scans and verifies
                 what's listed in the manifest. You can't use this option when
                 transferring  to  S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier
                 Deep Archive  storage  classes.  For  more  information,  see
                 Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations .

              o NONE  -  DataSync  performs  data integrity checks only during
                your transfer. Unlike other  options,  there's  no  additional
                verification at the end of your transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the
              destination location.

              o ALWAYS (default) - DataSync modifies data in  the  destination
                location when source data (including metadata) has changed. If
                DataSync  overwrites  objects,  you  might  incur   additional
                charges  for  certain  Amazon S3 storage classes (for example,
                for retrieval or early deletion). For  more  information,  see
                Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers .

              o NEVER - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination lo-
                cation even if the source data has changed. You can  use  this
                option to protect against overwriting changes made to files or
                objects in the destination.

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last  time
              a file was read or written to.

              NOTE:
                 The  behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              o BEST_EFFORT (default) -  DataSync  attempts  to  preserve  the
                original  Atime  attribute  on  all source files (that is, the
                version before the PREPARING steps  of  the  task  execution).
                This option is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Atime  is  set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be set to PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last  time
              that  a  file  was  written to before the PREPARING step of your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Preserves original Mtime , which is rec-
                ommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If Mtime is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set  to  BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              o INT_VALUE  (default)  - Preserves the integer value of UID and
                group ID (GID), which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              o INT_VALUE (default) - Preserves the integer value of  user  ID
                (UID) and GID, which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For  more  information,  see  Understanding how DataSync handles
              file and object metadata .

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies whether files in the destination location  that  don't
              exist  in the source should be preserved. This option can affect
              your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes  objects,  you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is
                recommended.

              o REMOVE - Deletes destination files that arent present  in  the
                source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode to ALL . When you transfer all  data,  DataSync  doesn't
                 scan  your  destination  location  and  doesn't  know what to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and  character  devices  in the source location and recreate the
              files with that device name and  metadata  on  the  destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't copy the actual contents of these devices be-
                 cause they're nonterminal and  don't  return  an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              o NONE (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).

              o PRESERVE - Preserves character and block device metadata. This
                option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For  more  information,  see  Understanding how DataSync handles
              file and object metadata .

              o PRESERVE (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions,  which
                is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can  preserve  extant permissions of a source loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits the bandwidth used by a DataSync task.  For  example,  if
              you  want  DataSync  to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

              NOTE:
                 Not applicable to Enhanced mode tasks .

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during  certain  scenarios when running multiple tasks . This is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies the type of logs that DataSync publishes to  a  Amazon
              CloudWatch  Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group, see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              o BASIC - Publishes logs with only basic  information  (such  as
                transfer errors).

              o TRANSFER  -  Publishes logs for all files or objects that your
                DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.

              o OFF - No logs are published.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync transfers only  the  data  (including
              metadata)  that  differs  between locations following an initial
              copy or transfers all data every  time  you  run  the  task.  If
              you're  planning  on recurring transfers, you might only want to
              transfer what's changed since your previous task execution.

              o CHANGED (default) - After your initial full transfer, DataSync
                copies  only  the  data  and metadata that differs between the
                source and destination location.

              o ALL - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destina-
                tion without comparing differences between the locations.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies  which  components  of the SMB security descriptor are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File Server locations. For more information,  see  Understanding
              how DataSync handles file and object metadata .

              o OWNER_DACL (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies
                the following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't
                  copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this  op-
                  tion.

              o OWNER_DACL_SACL  - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object.

                o SACLs,  which  are used by administrators to log attempts to
                  access a secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting ad-
                  ditional  permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses
                  to access your SMB location. For information about  choosing
                  a  user with the right permissions, see required permissions
                  for SMB , FSx for Windows File Server ,  or  FSx  for  ONTAP
                  (depending on the type of location in your transfer).

              o NONE  -  None  of  the  SMB security descriptor components are
                copied. Destination objects are owned by  the  user  that  was
                provided  for  accessing  the  destination location. DACLs and
                SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want DataSync to PRESERVE object tags (de-
              fault  behavior)  when  transferring between object storage sys-
              tems. If you want your DataSync  task  to  ignore  object  tags,
              specify the NONE value.

       Excludes -> (list)
          The  exclude  filters that define the files, objects, and folders in
          your source location that you don't want DataSync to  transfer.  For
          more  information  and examples, see Specifying what DataSync trans-
          fers by using filters .

          (structure)
              Specifies which files, folders, and objects to  include  or  ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The  type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A single filter string that consists of the patterns  to  in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       Schedule -> (structure)
          The schedule for when you want your task to run. For  more  informa-
          tion, see Scheduling your task .

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              Specifies your task schedule by using a cron or rate expression.

              Use  cron  expressions for task schedules that run on a specific
              time and day. For example, the following cron expression creates
              a  task schedule that runs at 8 AM on the first Wednesday of ev-
              ery month:
                 cron(0 8 * * 3#1)

              Use rate expressions for task schedules that run  on  a  regular
              interval.  For  example, the following rate expression creates a
              task schedule that runs every 12 hours:
                 rate(12 hours)

              For information about cron and rate expression syntax, see the `
              Amazon             EventBridge             User            Guide
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.html`__
              .

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to enable or disable your task schedule. Your
              schedule is enabled by default,  but  there  can  be  situations
              where  you  need  to  disable it. For example, you might need to
              pause a recurring transfer to fix an issue  with  your  task  or
              perform maintenance on your storage system.

              DataSync  might disable your schedule automatically if your task
              fails repeatedly with the same error. For more information,  see
              TaskScheduleDetails .

                ing a full list of files, objects, and directories  that  were
                transferred, skipped, verified, and more.

          ReportLevel -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want your task report to include only what
              went wrong with your transfer or a list of  what  succeeded  and
              didn't.

              tion.

          Overrides -> (structure)
              Customizes  the reporting level for aspects of your task report.
              For example, your report might generally  only  include  errors,
              but  you could specify that you want a list of successes and er-
              rors just for the files that DataSync  attempted  to  delete  in
              your destination location.

              Transferred -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and

                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the
                     same  time,  you  want to verify that your task filter is
                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-
                     thing transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer  (SUC-

                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Deleted -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and
                 directories  that DataSync attempted to delete in your desti-

                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Skipped -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and
                 directories  that  DataSync  attempted  to  skip  during your

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies whether your task report includes  errors  only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For  example,  your report might mostly include only what
                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the
                     same  time,  you  want to verify that your task filter is
                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-

          The details about your task schedule .

          StatusUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              Indicates  the  last  time  the  status  of  your  task schedule
              changed. For example, if DataSync  automatically  disables  your
              schedule  because  of  a  repeated  error,  you can see when the
              schedule was disabled.

          DisabledReason -> (string)
              Provides a reason if the task schedule is disabled.

              If your schedule is disabled by USER , you see a  Manually  dis-
              abled by user. message.

              If  your schedule is disabled by SERVICE , you see an error mes-
              sage to help you understand why the task keeps failing. For  in-
              formation  on resolving DataSync errors, see Troubleshooting is-
              sues with DataSync transfers .

          DisabledBy -> (string)
              Indicates how your task schedule was disabled.

              o USER - Your  schedule  was  manually  disabled  by  using  the
                UpdateTask operation or DataSync console.

              o SERVICE - Your schedule was automatically disabled by DataSync
                because the task failed repeatedly with the same error.

       TaskMode -> (string)
          The task mode that you're using. For more information, see  Choosing
          a task mode for your data transfer .
