NAME
       create-location-efs -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint for an Amazon EFS file system that DataSync can ac-
       cess for a transfer. For more information, see Creating a location  for
       Amazon EFS .

          --efs-filesystem-arn <value>

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies  a  mount  path  for  your Amazon EFS file system. This is
          where DataSync reads or writes data  (depending  on  if  this  is  a
          source  or destination location). By default, DataSync uses the root
          directory, but you can also include subdirectories.

          NOTE:
              You must specify a value  with  forward  slashes  (for  example,
              /path/to/folder ).

       --efs-filesystem-arn (string)
          Specifies the ARN for the Amazon EFS file system.

       --ec2-config (structure)
          Specifies  the  subnet  and  security groups DataSync uses to access
          your Amazon EFS file system.

          SubnetArn -> (string)
              Specifies the ARN of a subnet where DataSync creates the network
              interfaces for managing traffic during your transfer.

              The subnet must be located:

              o In the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the Amazon EFS file
                system.

              o In the same Availability Zone as at least one mount target for
                the Amazon EFS file system.

              NOTE:
                 You  don't need to specify a subnet that includes a file sys-
                 tem mount target.

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              Specifies the Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  of  the  security
              groups associated with an Amazon EFS file system's mount target.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetArn=string,SecurityGroupArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetArn": "string",
            "SecurityGroupArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  the key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to
          add to the resource. The value can be an empty  string.  This  value
          helps  you  manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recom-
          mend that you create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in a list of Amazon Web  Services  re-
              source  tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --access-point-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  access  point  that
          DataSync uses to access the Amazon EFS file system.

       --file-system-access-role-arn (string)
          Specifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that DataSync
          assumes when mounting the Amazon EFS file system.

       --in-transit-encryption (string)
          Specifies whether you want  DataSync  to  use  TLS  encryption  when
          transferring data to or from your Amazon EFS file system.

          If  you  specify an access point using AccessPointArn or an IAM role
          using FileSystemAccessRoleArn ,  you  must  set  this  parameter  to
          TLS1_2 .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o TLS1_2

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EFS file  system  loca-
          tion that you create.
