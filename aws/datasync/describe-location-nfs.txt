OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  NFS  location  that
          you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the NFS location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the NFS location.

       OnPremConfig -> (structure)
          The DataSync agents that are connecting to  a  Network  File  System
          (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Resource Names (ARNs) of the agents connecting to a
              transfer location.

              (string)

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The mount options that DataSync uses to mount your NFS file server.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies the NFS version that you want  DataSync  to  use  when
              mounting  your  NFS share. If the server refuses to use the ver-
              sion specified, the task fails.

              You can specify the following options:

              o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

              o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous
                writes on the server.

              o NFSv4_0  :  Stateful,  firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o NFSv4_1 : Stateful protocol version  that  supports  sessions,
                directory  delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS ver-
                sion 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync currently only supports NFS version  3  with  Amazon
                 FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the NFS location was created.
