DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()                                DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()



NAME
       describe-location-nfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata, such as the path information, about an NFS location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-nfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  NFS  location  that  was  de-
          scribed.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the source NFS location that was described.

       OnPremConfig -> (structure)
          A  list  of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Net-
          work File System (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The NFS mount options that DataSync used to mount your NFS share.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies the NFS version that you want  DataSync  to  use  when
              mounting  your  NFS share. If the server refuses to use the ver-
              sion specified, the task fails.

              You can specify the following options:

              o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

              o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous
                writes on the server.

              o NFSv4_0  :  Stateful,  firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o NFSv4_1 : Stateful protocol version  that  supports  sessions,
                directory  delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS ver-
                sion 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync currently only supports NFS version  3  with  Amazon
                 FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the NFS location was created.
