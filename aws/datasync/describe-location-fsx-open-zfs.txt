OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for  OpenZFS  location  to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for OpenZFS location that was described.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The uniform resource identifier (URI) of the FSx for  OpenZFS  loca-
          tion that was described.

          Example: fsxz://us-west-2.fs-1234567890abcdef02/fsx/folderA/folder

       SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
          The  ARNs of the security groups that are configured for the FSx for
          OpenZFS file system.

          (string)

       Protocol -> (structure)
          The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Specifies the Network File System (NFS)  protocol  configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or
              FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies how DataSync can access a location  using  the  NFS
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  NFS version that you want DataSync to use
                     when mounting your NFS share. If the  server  refuses  to
                     use the version specified, the task fails.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

                     o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                       chronous writes on the server.

                     o NFSv4_0 : Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol  version
                       that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     o NFSv4_1  : Stateful protocol version that supports ses-
                       sions, directory delegations, and  parallel  data  pro-
                       cessing.  NFS  version  4.1  also includes all features
                       available in version 4.0.

                     NOTE:
                        DataSync currently only supports NFS  version  3  with
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

          SMB -> (structure)
              Specifies  the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for  ONTAP  file  system's
              SVM.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Mi-
                 crosoft Active Directory that your  storage  virtual  machine
                 (SVM) belongs to.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how  DataSync  can access a location using the SMB
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies the SMB version that you want DataSync  to  use
                     when mounting your SMB share. If you don't specify a ver-
                     sion, DataSync defaults to AUTOMATIC and chooses  a  ver-
                     sion based on negotiation with the SMB server.

              Password -> (string)
                 Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access
                 your SVM.

              User -> (string)
                 Specifies a user name that can mount the location and  access
                 the files, folders, and metadata that you need in the SVM.

                 If you provide a user in your Active Directory, note the fol-
                 lowing:

                 o If you're using Directory Service for Microsoft Active  Di-
                   rectory,  the  user must be a member of the Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices Delegated FSx Administrators group.

                 o If you're using a self-managed Active Directory,  the  user
                   must  be  a  member  of either the Domain Admins group or a
                   custom group that you specified for file system administra-
                   tion when you created your file system.

                 Make  sure that the user has the permissions it needs to copy
                 the data you want:

                 o SE_TCB_NAME : Required to set  object  ownership  and  file
                   metadata.  With this privilege, you also can copy NTFS dis-
                   cretionary access lists (DACLs).

                 o SE_SECURITY_NAME : May be needed to copy NTFS system access
                   control lists (SACLs). This operation specifically requires
                   the Windows privilege, which is granted to members  of  the
                   Domain  Admins  group.  If  you configure your task to copy
                   SACLs, make sure that the user has the required privileges.
                   For information about copying SACLs, see Ownership and per-
                   missions-related options .

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the FSx for OpenZFS location was created.
