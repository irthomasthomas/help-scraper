NAME
       describe-location-fsx-open-zfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata about an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS location, such as in-
       formation about its path.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-fsx-open-zfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for  OpenZFS  location  to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for OpenZFS location that was described.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The uniform resource identifier (URI) of the FSx for  OpenZFS  loca-
          tion that was described.

          Example: fsxz://us-west-2.fs-1234567890abcdef02/fsx/folderA/folder

       SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
          The  ARNs of the security groups that are configured for the FSx for
          OpenZFS file system.

          (string)

       Protocol -> (structure)
          The type of protocol that DataSync uses to access your file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Represents the Network File System (NFS) protocol that  DataSync
              uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Represents  the mount options that are available for DataSync
                 to access an NFS location.

                 Version -> (string)
                     The specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to
                     mount  your  NFS  share. If the server refuses to use the
                     version specified, the sync will fail. If you don't spec-
                     ify  a version, DataSync defaults to AUTOMATIC . That is,
                     DataSync automatically selects a version based on negoti-
                     ation with the NFS server.

                     You can specify the following NFS versions:

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv3  **  - stateless protocol version that allows for
                       asynchronous writes on the server.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 143)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv4.0 ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol  ver-
                       sion that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 145)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                     o

                       **
                       NFSv4.1  **  -  stateful protocol version that supports
                       sessions, directory delegations, and parallel data pro-
                       cessing.  Version 4.1 also includes all features avail-
                       able in version 4.0.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 147)
                       Inline strong start-string without end-string.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the FSx for OpenZFS location was created.
