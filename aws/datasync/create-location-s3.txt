CREATE-LOCATION-S3()                                      CREATE-LOCATION-S3()



NAME
       create-location-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  transfer location for an Amazon S3 bucket. DataSync can use
       this location as a source or destination for transferring data.

       WARNING:
          Before you begin, make sure that you read the following topics:

          o Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations

          o Evaluating S3 request costs when using DataSync

       For more information, see Configuring transfers with Amazon S3 .

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies a prefix in the S3 bucket  that  DataSync  reads  from  or
          writes  to  (depending on whether the bucket is a source or destina-
          tion location).

          NOTE:
              DataSync can't transfer objects with a prefix that begins with a
              slash (/ ) or includes // , /./ , or /../ patterns. For example:

              o /photos

              o photos//2006/January

              o photos/./2006/February

              o photos/../2006/March

       --s3-bucket-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  ARN of the S3 bucket that you want to use as a loca-
          tion. (When creating your DataSync task later, you  specify  whether
          this location is a transfer source or destination.)

          If your S3 bucket is located on an Outposts resource, you must spec-
          ify an Amazon S3 access point. For more  information,  see  Managing
          data access with Amazon S3 access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide
          .

       --s3-storage-class (string)
          Specifies the storage class that you want your objects to  use  when
          Amazon S3 is a transfer destination.

          For  buckets  in  Amazon Web Services Regions, the storage class de-
          faults to STANDARD . For buckets on Outposts, the storage class  de-
          faults to OUTPOSTS .

          For  more  information, see Storage class considerations with Amazon
          S3 transfers .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o STANDARD_IA

          o ONEZONE_IA

          o INTELLIGENT_TIERING

          o GLACIER

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o OUTPOSTS

          o GLACIER_INSTANT_RETRIEVAL

       --s3-config (structure)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and  Access
          Management (IAM) role that DataSync uses to access your S3 bucket.

          For more information, see Accessing S3 buckets .

          BucketAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              Specifies  the  ARN of the IAM role that DataSync uses to access
              your S3 bucket.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BucketAccessRoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BucketAccessRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --agent-arns (list)
          (Amazon S3 on Outposts only)  Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN) of the DataSync agent on your Outpost.

          For more information, see Deploy your DataSync agent on Outposts .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  labels  that  help you categorize, filter, and search for
          your Amazon Web Services resources. We recommend creating at least a
          name tag for your transfer location.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair representing a single tag that's been applied
              to an Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
