CREATE-AGENT()                                                  CREATE-AGENT()



NAME
       create-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Activates  an DataSync agent that you have deployed in your storage en-
       vironment. The activation process associates your agent with  your  ac-
       count.  In  the activation process, you specify information such as the
       Amazon Web Services Region that you want to activate the agent in.  You
       activate  the agent in the Amazon Web Services Region where your target
       locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks  are  created
       in this Amazon Web Services Region.

       You  can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide
       the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks  without  going
       over the public internet.

       You  can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multi-
       ple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the  task  to
       run.  If  you  use multiple agents for a source location, the status of
       all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.

       Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services  on  a  regular
       basis,  using  a  mechanism  that  ensures minimal interruption to your
       tasks.

OPTIONS
       --activation-key (string)
          Your agent activation key. You can get the activation key either  by
          sending  an  HTTP  GET request with redirects that enable you to get
          the agent IP address (port 80). Alternatively, you can get  it  from
          the DataSync console.

          The  redirect  URL returned in the response provides you the activa-
          tion key for your agent in the query string parameter  activationKey
          .  It  might  also include other activation-related parameters; how-
          ever, these are merely defaults. The arguments you pass to this  API
          call determine the actual configuration of your agent.

          For  more  information, see Activating an Agent in the DataSync User
          Guide.

       --agent-name (string)
          The name you configured for your agent. This value is a text  refer-
          ence that is used to identify the agent in the console.

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair  that represents the tag that you want to asso-
          ciate with the agent. The value can be an empty string.  This  value
          helps you manage, filter, and search for your agents.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair representing a single tag that's been applied
              to an Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --vpc-endpoint-id (string)
          The ID of the VPC (virtual private cloud) endpoint  that  the  agent
          has  access  to. This is the client-side VPC endpoint, also called a
          PrivateLink. If you don't  have  a  PrivateLink  VPC  endpoint,  see
          Creating a VPC Endpoint Service Configuration in the Amazon VPC User
          Guide.

          VPC endpoint ID looks like this: vpce-01234d5aff67890e1 .

       --subnet-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets  in  which  DataSync
          will  create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task.
          The agent that runs a task must be private. When you  start  a  task
          that  is  associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has
          access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private.  In
          this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in
          your subnet. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able  to
          route to all these four network interfaces.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The  ARNs  of the security groups used to protect your data transfer
          task subnets. See SecurityGroupArns .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       AgentArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent. Use the ListAgents op-
