OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EFS file  system  loca-
          tion that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon EFS file system location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the Amazon EFS file system location.

       Ec2Config -> (structure)
          The  subnet  and  security  groups that DataSync uses to access your
          Amazon EFS file system.

          SubnetArn -> (string)
              Specifies the ARN of a subnet where DataSync creates the network
              interfaces for managing traffic during your transfer.

              The subnet must be located:

              o In the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the Amazon EFS file
                system.

              o In the same Availability Zone as at least one mount target for
                the Amazon EFS file system.

              NOTE:
                 You  don't need to specify a subnet that includes a file sys-
                 tem mount target.

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              Specifies the Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  of  the  security
              groups associated with an Amazon EFS file system's mount target.

              (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the location was created.

       AccessPointArn -> (string)
          The  ARN of the access point that DataSync uses to access the Amazon
          EFS file system.

       FileSystemAccessRoleArn -> (string)
          The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that DataSync  assumes
          when mounting the Amazon EFS file system.

       InTransitEncryption -> (string)
          Describes  whether  DataSync uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) en-
          cryption when copying data to or from the Amazon EFS file system.
