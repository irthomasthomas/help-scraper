DESCRIBE-LOCATION-EFS()                                DESCRIBE-LOCATION-EFS()



NAME
       describe-location-efs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata  about  your DataSync location for an Amazon EFS file
       system.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-efs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EFS file  system  loca-
          tion that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon EFS file system location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the Amazon EFS file system location.

       Ec2Config -> (structure)
          The subnet and security groups that DataSync  uses  to  access  your
          Amazon EFS file system.

          SubnetArn -> (string)
              Specifies the ARN of a subnet where DataSync creates the network
              interfaces for managing traffic during your transfer.

              The subnet must be located:

              o In the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the Amazon EFS file
                system.

              o In the same Availability Zone as at least one mount target for
                the Amazon EFS file system.

              NOTE:
                 You don't need to specify a subnet that includes a file  sys-
                 tem mount target.

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              Specifies  the  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs)  of the security
              groups associated with an Amazon EFS file system's mount target.

              (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the location was created.

       AccessPointArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the access point that DataSync uses to access the  Amazon
          EFS file system.

       FileSystemAccessRoleArn -> (string)
          The  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that DataSync assumes
          when mounting the Amazon EFS file system.

       InTransitEncryption -> (string)
          Whether DataSync uses TLS encryption when transferring  data  to  or
          from your Amazon EFS file system.
