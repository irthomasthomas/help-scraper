START-TASK-EXECUTION()                                  START-TASK-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  DataSync transfer task. For each task, you can only run one
       task execution at a time.

       There are several phases to a task execution. For more information, see
       Task execution statuses .

       WARNING:
          If  you're  planning  to transfer data to or from an Amazon S3 loca-
          tion, review how DataSync can affect your S3 request charges and the
          DataSync pricing page before you begin.

OPTIONS
       --task-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that you want
          to start.

       --override-options (structure)
          Indicates how your transfer task is configured.  These  options  in-
          clude  how  DataSync  handles  files,  objects, and their associated
          metadata during your transfer. You also can specify  how  to  verify
          data  integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other op-
          tions.

          Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't  have
          to configure any option before calling StartTaskExecution .

          You also can override your task options for each task execution. For
          example, you might want to adjust the LogLevel for an individual ex-
          ecution.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  and  when  DataSync checks the integrity of your
              data during a transfer.

              o ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended) - DataSync calculates the
                checksum of transferred files and metadata at the source loca-
                tion. At the end of the transfer, DataSync then compares  this
                checksum to the checksum calculated on those files at the des-
                tination. We recommend this option  when  transferring  to  S3
                Glacier  Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
                classes. For more information, see  Storage  class  considera-
                tions with Amazon S3 locations .

              o POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT  (default) - At the end of the trans-
                fer, DataSync scans the entire source and destination to  ver-
                ify  that  both locations are fully synchronized. If you use a
                manifest , DataSync only scans and verifies what's  listed  in
                the  manifest.  You can't use this option when transferring to
                S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive stor-
                age classes. For more information, see Storage class consider-
                ations with Amazon S3 locations .

              o NONE - DataSync doesn't run additional verification at the end
                of  the  transfer.  All  data  transmissions  are still integ-
                rity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the
              destination location.

              o ALWAYS  (default)  - DataSync modifies data in the destination
                location when source data (including metadata) has changed. If
                DataSync   overwrites  objects,  you  might  incur  additional
                charges for certain Amazon S3 storage  classes  (for  example,
                for  retrieval  or  early deletion). For more information, see
                Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers .

              o NEVER - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination lo-
                cation  even  if the source data has changed. You can use this
                option to protect against overwriting changes made to files or
                objects in the destination.

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              a file was read or written to.

              NOTE:
                 The behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across  platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              o BEST_EFFORT  (default)  -  DataSync  attempts  to preserve the
                original Atime attribute on all source  files  (that  is,  the
                version  before  the  PREPARING  phase of the task execution).
                This option is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be  set  to  PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              that a file was written to before the PREPARING  phase  of  your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              o PRESERVE (default) - Preserves original Mtime , which is  rec-
                ommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              o INT_VALUE (default) - Preserves the integer value of  UID  and
                group ID (GID), which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              o INT_VALUE  (default)  - Preserves the integer value of user ID
                (UID) and GID, which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies whether files in the destination location  that  don't
              exist  in the source should be preserved. This option can affect
              your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes  objects,  you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is
                recommended.

              o REMOVE - Deletes destination files that arent present  in  the
                source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode to ALL . When you transfer all  data,  DataSync  doesn't
                 scan  your  destination  location  and  doesn't  know what to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and  character  devices  in the source location and recreate the
              files with that device name and  metadata  on  the  destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't copy the actual contents of these devices be-
                 cause they're nonterminal and  don't  return  an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              o NONE (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).

              o PRESERVE - Preserves character and block device metadata. This
                option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which
                is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits  the  bandwidth  used by a DataSync task. For example, if
              you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set  this  value  to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during certain scenarios when running multiple tasks .  This  is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group,  see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              o BASIC  -  Publishes  logs with only basic information (such as
                transfer errors).

              o TRANSFER - Publishes logs for all files or objects  that  your
                DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.

              o OFF - No logs are published.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
              that differ between the source and the destination  location  or
              transfers  all  the  content  from the source (without comparing
              what's in the destination).

              o CHANGED (default) - DataSync copies only data or metadata that
                is  new  or  different content from the source location to the
                destination location.

              o ALL - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destina-
                tion without comparing differences between the locations.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies  which  components  of the SMB security descriptor are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File Server locations. For more information,  see  how  DataSync
              handles metadata .

              o OWNER_DACL (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies
                the following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't
                  copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this  op-
                  tion.

              o OWNER_DACL_SACL  - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs),  which  de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object.

                o SACLs,  which  are used by administrators to log attempts to
                  access a secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting ad-
                  ditional  permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses
                  to access your SMB location. For information about  choosing
                  a  user with the right permissions, see required permissions
                  for SMB , FSx for Windows File Server ,  or  FSx  for  ONTAP
                  (depending on the type of location in your transfer).

              o NONE  -  None  of  the  SMB security descriptor components are
                copied. Destination objects are owned by  the  user  that  was
                provided  for  accessing  the  destination location. DACLs and
                SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want DataSync to PRESERVE object tags (de-
              fault  behavior)  when  transferring between object storage sys-
              tems. If you want your DataSync  task  to  ignore  object  tags,
              specify the NONE value.

       --includes (list)
          Specifies  a list of filter rules that determines which files to in-
          clude when running a task. The pattern should contain a single  fil-
          ter  string  that  consists of the patterns to include. The patterns
          are  delimited  by   "|"   (that   is,   a   pipe),   for   example,
          "/folder1|/folder2" .

          (structure)
              Specifies  which  files,  folders, and objects to include or ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)

       --excludes (list)
          Specifies  a list of filter rules that determines which files to ex-
          clude from a task. The list contains a  single  filter  string  that
          consists  of  the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by

       --manifest-config (structure)
          Configures a manifest, which is a list of files or objects that  you
          want  DataSync  to  transfer. For more information and configuration
          examples, see Specifying what DataSync transfers by using a manifest
          .

          When  using  this  parameter,  your  caller  identity (the role that
          you're using DataSync with) must have the  iam:PassRole  permission.
          The AWSDataSyncFullAccess policy includes this permission.

          To  remove  a manifest configuration, specify this parameter with an
          empty value.

          Action -> (string)
              Specifies what DataSync uses the manifest for.

          Format -> (string)
              Specifies the file format of your manifest.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see Creating a manifest .

          Source -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  manifest that you want DataSync to use and where
              it's hosted.

              NOTE:
                 You must specify this parameter if you're configuring  a  new
                 manifest on or after February 7, 2024.

                 If  you don't, you'll get a 400 status code and ValidationEx-
                 ception error stating that you're missing the  IAM  role  for
                 DataSync  to  access  the S3 bucket where you're hosting your
                 manifest. For more information, see Providing DataSync access
                 to your manifest .

              S3 -> (structure)
                 Specifies the S3 bucket where you're hosting your manifest.

                 ManifestObjectPath -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 object key of your manifest. This
                     can include a prefix (for example, prefix/my-manifest.csv

          you're using DataSync with) must have the  iam:PassRole  permission.
          The AWSDataSyncFullAccess policy includes this permission.

          To  remove  a  task  report configuration, specify this parameter as
          empty.

          Destination -> (structure)
              Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where DataSync uploads your  task

                     S3 bucket. For more information, see Allowing DataSync to
                     upload a task report to an Amazon S3 bucket .

          OutputType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of task report that you want:

              o SUMMARY_ONLY : Provides necessary details about your task, in-
                cluding  the  number of files, objects, and directories trans-
                ferred and transfer duration.

              o STANDARD : Provides complete details about your task,  includ-
                ing  a  full list of files, objects, and directories that were
                transferred, skipped, verified, and more.

          ReportLevel -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want your task report to include only what
              went  wrong  with  your transfer or a list of what succeeded and
              didn't.

              o ERRORS_ONLY : A report  shows  what  DataSync  was  unable  to
                transfer, skip, verify, and delete.

              o SUCCESSES_AND_ERRORS  :  A report shows what DataSync was able
                and unable to transfer, skip, verify, and delete.

          ObjectVersionIds -> (string)
              Specifies whether your task report includes the new  version  of
              each  object transferred into an S3 bucket. This only applies if
              you enable versioning on your bucket . Keep in mind that setting
              this  to  INCLUDE  can increase the duration of your task execu-
              tion.

          Overrides -> (structure)
              Customizes the reporting level for aspects of your task  report.
              For  example,  your  report might generally only include errors,
              but you could specify that you want a list of successes and  er-
              rors  just  for  the  files that DataSync attempted to delete in
              your destination location.

              Transferred -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and
                 directories that DataSync attempted to transfer.

                     Specifies  whether  your task report includes errors only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For example, your report might mostly include  only  what
                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Verified -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and

                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the
                     same  time,  you  want to verify that your task filter is
                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-
                     thing transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer  (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Deleted -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and
                 directories that DataSync attempted to delete in your  desti-
                 nation location. This only applies if you configure your task
                 to delete data in the destination that isn't in the source.

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies whether your task report includes  errors  only
                     or successes and errors.

                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Skipped -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and
                 directories that  DataSync  attempted  to  skip  during  your
                 transfer.

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  your task report includes errors only
                     or successes and errors.
