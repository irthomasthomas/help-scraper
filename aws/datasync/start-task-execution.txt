START-TASK-EXECUTION()                                  START-TASK-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  DataSync transfer task. For each task, you can only run one
       task execution at a time.

       There are several phases to a task execution. For more information, see
       Task execution statuses .

       WARNING:
          If  you're  planning  to transfer data to or from an Amazon S3 loca-
          tion, review how DataSync can affect your S3 request charges and the
          DataSync pricing page before you begin.

OPTIONS
       --task-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that you want
          to start.

       --override-options (structure)
          Indicates how your transfer task is configured.  These  options  in-
          clude  how  DataSync  handles  files,  objects, and their associated
          metadata during your transfer. You also can specify  how  to  verify
          data  integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other op-
          tions.

          Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't  have
          to configure any of these options before starting your task.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies  how  and  when  DataSync checks the integrity of your
              data during a transfer.

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT
                 ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): DataSync calculates the
                 checksum  of transferred files and metadata at the source lo-
                 cation. At the end of the transfer,  DataSync  then  compares
                 this  checksum  to  the checksum calculated on those files at
                 the destination.

              We recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier  Flexi-
              ble  Retrieval  or  S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For
              more information, see Storage class considerations  with  Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT  : At the end of the transfer, Data-
                 Sync scans the entire source and destination to  verify  that
                 both locations are fully synchronized.

              You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexi-
              ble Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive  storage  classes.  For
              more  information,  see Storage class considerations with Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 NONE : DataSync doesn't run additional  verification  at  the
                 end  of the transfer. All data transmissions are still integ-
                 rity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether data at the  destination  location  should  be
              overwritten  or  preserved. If set to NEVER , a destination file
              for example will not be replaced by a source file (even  if  the
              destination  file  differs  from the source file). If you modify
              files in the destination and you sync the  files,  you  can  use
              this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some  storage  classes  have  specific behaviors that can affect
              your Amazon S3  storage  cost.  For  detailed  information,  see
              Considerations  when  working  with Amazon S3 storage classes in
              DataSync .

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last  time
              a file was read or written to. If you set Atime to BEST_EFFORT ,
              DataSync attempts to preserve the original  Atime  attribute  on
              all  source  files  (that  is,  the version before the PREPARING
              phase of the task execution).

              NOTE:
                 The behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across  platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT
                 BEST_EFFORT  :  Attempt  to preserve the per-file Atime value
                 (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be  set  to  PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              that a file was written to before the PREPARING  phase  of  your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              Default Value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

                 NONE : Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If Mtime is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set  to  BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default  value:  INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer value of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE : Preserve the integer value of UID  and  group  ID
                 (GID) (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default  value:  INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer value of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE : Preserve the integer value of user ID  (UID)  and
                 GID (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  files in the destination location that don't
              exist in the source should be preserved. This option can  affect
              your  Amazon  S3 storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Ignore such destination files (recommended).

                 REMOVE : Delete destination files that arent present  in  the
                 source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode to ALL . When you transfer all  data,  DataSync  doesn't
                 scan  your  destination  location  and  doesn't  know what to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and  character  devices  in the source location and recreate the
              files with that device name and  metadata  on  the  destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't copy the actual contents of these devices be-
                 cause they're nonterminal and  don't  return  an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE
                 NONE : Ignore special devices (recommended).

                 PRESERVE : Preserve character and block device metadata. This
                 option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can  preserve  extant permissions of a source loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits the bandwidth used by a DataSync task.  For  example,  if
              you  want  DataSync  to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during  certain  scenarios when running multiple tasks . This is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies the type of logs that DataSync publishes to  a  Amazon
              CloudWatch  Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group, see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              If you set LogLevel to OFF , no logs are published.  BASIC  pub-
              lishes logs on errors for individual files transferred. TRANSFER
              publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred  and
              integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
              that differ between the source and the destination  location  or
              transfers  all  the  content  from the source (without comparing
              what's in the destination).
                 CHANGED : DataSync copies only data or metadata that  is  new
                 or different content from the source location to the destina-
                 tion location.

                 ALL : DataSync copies all source location content to the des-
                 tination (without comparing what's in the destination).

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies  which  components  of the SMB security descriptor are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File Server locations. For more information,  see  how  DataSync
              handles metadata .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which  deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't copy
                NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this option.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to ac-
                cess  a  secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting addi-
                tional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync  uses  to
                access  your  SMB  location.  For information about choosing a
                user that ensures sufficient permissions  to  files,  folders,
                and metadata, see user .
                 NONE  :  None  of  the SMB security descriptor components are
                 copied. Destination objects are owned by the  user  that  was
                 provided  for  accessing  the destination location. DACLs and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies whether object tags are  preserved  when  transferring
              between  object  storage systems. If you want your DataSync task
              to ignore object tags, specify the NONE value.

                     upload a task report to an Amazon S3 bucket .

          OutputType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of task report that you want:

              o SUMMARY_ONLY : Provides necessary details about your task, in-
                cluding the number of files, objects, and  directories  trans-
                ferred and transfer duration.

              o STANDARD  : Provides complete details about your task, includ-
                ing a full list of files, objects, and directories  that  were
                transferred, skipped, verified, and more.

          ReportLevel -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want your task report to include only what
              went wrong with your transfer or a list of  what  succeeded  and
              didn't.

              o ERRORS_ONLY  :  A  report  shows  what  DataSync was unable to
                transfer, skip, verify, and delete.

              o SUCCESSES_AND_ERRORS : A report shows what DataSync  was  able
                and unable to transfer, skip, verify, and delete.

          ObjectVersionIds -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  your task report includes the new version of
              each object transferred into an S3 bucket. This only applies  if
              you enable versioning on your bucket . Keep in mind that setting
              this to INCLUDE can increase the duration of  your  task  execu-
              tion.

          Overrides -> (structure)
              Customizes  the reporting level for aspects of your task report.
              For example, your report might generally  only  include  errors,
              but  you could specify that you want a list of successes and er-
              rors just for the files that DataSync  attempted  to  delete  in
              your destination location.

              Transferred -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and
                 directories that DataSync attempted to transfer.

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies whether your task report includes  errors  only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For  example,  your report might mostly include only what
                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the
                     same  time,  you  want to verify that your task filter is
                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-
                     thing transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer  (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Verified -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and
                 directories that DataSync attempted to verify at the  end  of
                 your  transfer.  This only applies if you configure your task
                 to verify data during and after the transfer (which  DataSync
                 does by default).

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  your task report includes errors only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For example, your report might mostly include  only  what
                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Deleted -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and
                 directories  that DataSync attempted to delete in your desti-
                 nation location. This only applies if you configure your task
                 to delete data in the destination that isn't in the source.

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  your task report includes errors only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For example, your report might mostly include  only  what
                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Skipped -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and
                 directories  that  DataSync  attempted  to  skip  during your
                 transfer.

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies whether your task report includes  errors  only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For  example,  your report might mostly include only what
                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the

                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
