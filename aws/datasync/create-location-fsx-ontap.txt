CREATE-LOCATION-FSX-ONTAP()                        CREATE-LOCATION-FSX-ONTAP()



NAME
       create-location-fsx-ontap -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint for an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system that
       DataSync can access for a transfer. For more information, see  Creating
       a location for FSx for ONTAP .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-location-fsx-ontap
          --protocol <value>
          --security-group-arns <value>
          --storage-virtual-machine-arn <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --protocol (structure)
          Specifies  the  data  transfer protocol that DataSync uses to access
          your Amazon FSx file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Specifies the Network File System (NFS)  protocol  configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or
              FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies how DataSync can access a location  using  the  NFS
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  NFS version that you want DataSync to use
                     when mounting your NFS share. If the  server  refuses  to
                     use the version specified, the task fails.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

                     o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                       chronous writes on the server.

                     o NFSv4_0 : Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol  version
                       that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     o NFSv4_1  : Stateful protocol version that supports ses-
                       sions, directory delegations, and  parallel  data  pro-
                       cessing.  NFS  version  4.1  also includes all features
                       available in version 4.0.

                     NOTE:
                        DataSync currently only supports NFS  version  3  with
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

          SMB -> (structure)
              Specifies  the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for  ONTAP  file  system's
              SVM.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Mi-
                 crosoft Active Directory that your  storage  virtual  machine
                 (SVM) belongs to.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how  DataSync  can access a location using the SMB
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies the SMB version that you want DataSync  to  use
                     when mounting your SMB share. If you don't specify a ver-
                     sion, DataSync defaults to AUTOMATIC and chooses  a  ver-
                     sion based on negotiation with the SMB server.

              Password -> (string)
                 Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access
                 your SVM.

              User -> (string)
                 Specifies a user name that can mount the location and  access
                 the files, folders, and metadata that you need in the SVM.

                 If you provide a user in your Active Directory, note the fol-
                 lowing:

                 o If you're using Directory Service for Microsoft Active  Di-
                   rectory,  the  user must be a member of the Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices Delegated FSx Administrators group.

                 o If you're using a self-managed Active Directory,  the  user
                   must  be  a  member  of either the Domain Admins group or a
                   custom group that you specified for file system administra-
                   tion when you created your file system.

                 Make  sure that the user has the permissions it needs to copy
                 the data you want:

                 o SE_TCB_NAME : Required to set  object  ownership  and  file
                   metadata.  With this privilege, you also can copy NTFS dis-
                   cretionary access lists (DACLs).

                 o SE_SECURITY_NAME : May be needed to copy NTFS system access
                   control lists (SACLs). This operation specifically requires
                   the Windows privilege, which is granted to members  of  the
                   Domain  Admins  group.  If  you configure your task to copy
                   SACLs, make sure that the user has the required privileges.
                   For information about copying SACLs, see Ownership and per-
                   missions-related options .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NFS={MountOptions={Version=string}},SMB={Domain=string,MountOptions={Version=string},Password=string,User=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NFS": {
              "MountOptions": {
                "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
              }
            },

              },
              "Password": "string",
              "User": "string"
            }
          }

       --security-group-arns (list)
          Specifies the Amazon EC2 security groups that provide access to your
          file system's preferred subnet.

          The  security  groups  must  allow outbound traffic on the following
          ports (depending on the protocol you use):

          o Network File System (NFS) : TCP ports 111, 635, and 2049

          o Server Message Block (SMB) : TCP port 445

          Your file system's security groups must also allow  inbound  traffic
          on the same ports.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --storage-virtual-machine-arn (string)
          Specifies  the ARN of the storage virtual machine (SVM) on your file
          system where you're copying data to or from.

       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies the junction path (also known as a mount point) in the SVM
          volume where you're copying data to or from (for example, /vol1 ).

          NOTE:
              Don't specify a junction path in the SVM's root volume. For more
              information, see Managing FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machines
              in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Specifies  labels  that  help you categorize, filter, and search for
          your Amazon Web Services resources. We recommend creating at least a
          name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          Specifies the ARN of the FSx for ONTAP file system location that you
          create.
