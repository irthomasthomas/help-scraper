OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to update.

       --subdirectory (string)
          The  subdirectory  in  the NFS file system that is used to read data
          from the NFS source location or write data to the  NFS  destination.
          The  NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or
          a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can  be
          mounted by other NFS clients in your network.

          To  see all the paths exported by your NFS server, run "showmount -e
          nfs-server-name " from an NFS client that has access to your server.
          You  can  specify any directory that appears in the results, and any
          subdirectory of that directory. Ensure that the NFS export is acces-
          sible without Kerberos authentication.

          To  transfer all the data in the folder that you specified, DataSync
          must have permissions to read all the data. To ensure  this,  either
          configure  the  NFS  export with no_root_squash , or ensure that the
          files you want DataSync to access have permissions that  allow  read
          access  for all users. Doing either option enables the agent to read
          the files. For the agent to access directories, you  must  addition-
          ally enable all execute access.

          If  you  are  copying  data to or from your Snowcone device, see NFS
          Server on Snowcone for more information.

          For information  about  NFS  export  configuration,  see  18.7.  The
          /etc/exports Configuration File in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux doc-
          umentation.

       --on-prem-config (structure)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for  a  Net-
          work File System (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AgentArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AgentArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --mount-options (structure)
          Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies  the  NFS  version  that you want DataSync to use when
              mounting your NFS share. If the server refuses to use  the  ver-
              sion specified, the task fails.

              You can specify the following options:

              o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

              o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous
                writes on the server.

              o NFSv4_0 : Stateful, firewall-friendly  protocol  version  that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o NFSv4_1  :  Stateful  protocol version that supports sessions,
                directory delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS  ver-
                sion 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  currently  only  supports NFS version 3 with Amazon
                 FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
