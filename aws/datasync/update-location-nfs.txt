OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS transfer loca-
          tion that you want to update.

       --subdirectory (string)
          Specifies the export path in your NFS  file  server  that  you  want
          DataSync to mount.

          This  path  (or a subdirectory of the path) is where DataSync trans-
          fers data to or from. For information on configuring an  export  for
          DataSync, see Accessing NFS file servers .

       --on-prem-config (structure)
          The  DataSync  agents  that  are connecting to a Network File System
          (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the agents connecting  to  a
              transfer location.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AgentArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AgentArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --mount-options (structure)
          Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies  the  NFS  version  that you want DataSync to use when
              mounting your NFS share. If the server refuses to use  the  ver-
              sion specified, the task fails.

              You can specify the following options:

              o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

              o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous
                writes on the server.

              o NFSv4_0 : Stateful, firewall-friendly  protocol  version  that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o NFSv4_1  :  Stateful  protocol version that supports sessions,
                directory delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS  ver-
                sion 4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  currently  only  supports NFS version 3 with Amazon
                 FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"NFS3"|"NFS4_0"|"NFS4_1"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update your transfer location with a new agent

       The following update-location-nfs example updates your DataSync NFS lo-
       cation with a new agent.

          aws datasync update-location-nfs \
              --location-arn arn:aws:datasync:us-west-2:123456789012:location/loc-abcdef01234567890 \
              --on-prem-config AgentArns=arn:aws:datasync:us-west-2:123456789012:agent/agent-1234567890abcdef0

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Replacing your agent in the AWS DataSync User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
