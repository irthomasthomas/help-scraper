OPTIONS
       --agent-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  DataSync  agent  to
          describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AgentArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the agent.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the agent.

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the agent. If the status is ONLINE, then the agent  is
          configured  properly  and is available to use. The Running status is
          the normal running status for an agent. If the  status  is  OFFLINE,
          the  agent's VM is turned off or the agent is in an unhealthy state.
          When the issue that caused the  unhealthy  state  is  resolved,  the
          agent returns to ONLINE status.

       LastConnectionTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the agent last connected to DataSync.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  time that the agent was activated (that is, created in your ac-
          count).

       EndpointType -> (string)
          The type of endpoint that your agent is connected to.  If  the  end-
          point is a VPC endpoint, the agent is not accessible over the public
          internet.

       PrivateLinkConfig -> (structure)
          The subnet and the security group that DataSync used to access a VPC
          endpoint.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The  ID  of the VPC endpoint that is configured for an agent. An
              agent that is configured with a VPC endpoint will not be  acces-
              sible over the public internet.

          PrivateLinkEndpoint -> (string)
              The  private  endpoint  that is configured for an agent that has
              access to IP addresses in a PrivateLink . An agent that is  con-
              figured  with this endpoint will not be accessible over the pub-
              lic internet.

          SubnetArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets that are config-
              ured for an agent activated in a VPC or an agent that has access
              to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups that are
              configured for the EC2 resource that hosts an agent activated in
              a VPC or an agent that has access to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)
