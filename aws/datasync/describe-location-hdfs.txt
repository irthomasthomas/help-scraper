OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the HDFS location.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the HDFS location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URI of the HDFS location.

       NameNodes -> (list)
          The NameNode that manages the HDFS namespace.

          (structure)
              The NameNode of the Hadoop Distributed File System  (HDFS).  The
              NameNode  manages the file system's namespace. The NameNode per-
              forms operations such as opening, closing,  and  renaming  files
              and  directories.  The  NameNode contains the information to map
              blocks of data to the DataNodes.

              Hostname -> (string)
                 The hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS cluster. This  value
                 is  the  IP  address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the
                 NameNode. An agent that's  installed  on-premises  uses  this
                 hostname to communicate with the NameNode in the network.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the NameNode uses to listen to client requests.

       BlockSize -> (integer)
          The size of the data blocks to write into the HDFS cluster.

       ReplicationFactor -> (integer)
          The number of DataNodes to replicate the data to when writing to the
          HDFS cluster.

       KmsKeyProviderUri -> (string)
          The URI of the HDFS cluster's Key Management Server (KMS).

       QopConfiguration -> (structure)
          The Quality of Protection (QOP) configuration, which  specifies  the
          Remote  Procedure  Call  (RPC) and data transfer protection settings
          configured on the HDFS cluster.

          RpcProtection -> (string)
              The RPC protection setting configured on the HDFS cluster.  This
              setting  corresponds  to  your  hadoop.rpc.protection setting in
              your core-site.xml file on your Hadoop cluster.

          DataTransferProtection -> (string)
              The data transfer protection  setting  configured  on  the  HDFS
              cluster. This setting corresponds to your dfs.data.transfer.pro-
              tection setting in the hdfs-site.xml file on your  Hadoop  clus-
              ter.

       AuthenticationType -> (string)
          The  type  of  authentication  used to determine the identity of the
          user.

       SimpleUser -> (string)
          The user name to identify the client on the host  operating  system.
          This  parameter is used if the AuthenticationType is defined as SIM-
          PLE .

       KerberosPrincipal -> (string)
          The Kerberos principal with access to the files and folders  on  the
          HDFS  cluster.  This  parameter is used if the AuthenticationType is
          defined as KERBEROS .

       AgentArns -> (list)
          The ARNs of the DataSync agents that  can  connect  with  your  HDFS
          cluster.

          (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the HDFS location was created.
