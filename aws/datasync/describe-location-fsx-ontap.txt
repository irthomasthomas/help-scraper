NAME
       describe-location-fsx-ontap -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  details  about how an DataSync location for an Amazon FSx for
       NetApp ONTAP file system is configured.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-fsx-ontap
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for  ONTAP  file
          system location that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the location was created.

       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for ONTAP file system location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The uniform resource identifier (URI) of the FSx for ONTAP file sys-
          tem location.

       Protocol -> (structure)
          Specifies  the  data  transfer protocol that DataSync uses to access
          your Amazon FSx file system.

          NFS -> (structure)
              Specifies the Network File System (NFS)  protocol  configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for OpenZFS file system or
              FSx for ONTAP file system's storage virtual machine (SVM).

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies how DataSync can access a location  using  the  NFS
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  NFS version that you want DataSync to use
                     when mounting your NFS share. If the  server  refuses  to
                     use the version specified, the task fails.

                     You can specify the following options:

                     o AUTOMATIC (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

                     o NFS3 : Stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                       chronous writes on the server.

                     o NFSv4_0 : Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol  version
                       that supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

                     o NFSv4_1  : Stateful protocol version that supports ses-
                       sions, directory delegations, and  parallel  data  pro-
                       cessing.  NFS  version  4.1  also includes all features
                       available in version 4.0.

                     NOTE:
                        DataSync currently only supports NFS  version  3  with
                        Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP locations.

          SMB -> (structure)
              Specifies  the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration
              that DataSync uses to access your FSx for  ONTAP  file  system's
              SVM.

              Domain -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Mi-
                 crosoft Active Directory that your  storage  virtual  machine
                 (SVM) belongs to.

              MountOptions -> (structure)
                 Specifies  how  DataSync  can access a location using the SMB
                 protocol.

                 Version -> (string)
                     Specifies the SMB version that you want DataSync  to  use
                     when mounting your SMB share. If you don't specify a ver-
                     sion, DataSync defaults to AUTOMATIC and chooses  a  ver-
                     sion based on negotiation with the SMB server.

              Password -> (string)
                 Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access
                 your SVM.

              User -> (string)
                 Specifies a user who has permission to access your SVM.

       SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
          The security groups that DataSync uses to access your FSx for  ONTAP
          file system.

          (string)

       StorageVirtualMachineArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the storage virtual machine (SVM) on your FSx for ONTAP
          file system where you're copying data to or from.

       FsxFilesystemArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the FSx for ONTAP file system.
