OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the transfer task that's
          running.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TaskExecutionArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the task execution that was de-
          scribed. TaskExecutionArn is hierarchical and includes  TaskArn  for
          the task that was executed.

          For  example,  a  TaskExecution  value  with  the  ARN arn:aws:data-
          sync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execu-
          tion/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b   executed   the   task   with  the  ARN
          arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2
          .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the task execution.

          For  detailed  information about task execution statuses, see Under-
          standing Task Statuses in the DataSync User Guide.

       Options -> (structure)
          Configures your DataSync task settings. These  options  include  how
          DataSync  handles files, objects, and their associated metadata. You
          also can specify how DataSync verifies data integrity, set bandwidth
          limits for your task, among other options.

          Each task setting has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't
          have to configure any of these Options before starting your task.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how and when DataSync checks  the  integrity  of  your
              data during a transfer.

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT
                 ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended): DataSync calculates the
                 checksum of transferred files and metadata at the source  lo-
                 cation.  At  the  end of the transfer, DataSync then compares
                 this checksum to the checksum calculated on  those  files  at
                 the destination.

              We  recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexi-
              ble Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive  storage  classes.  For
              more  information,  see Storage class considerations with Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT : At the end of the transfer,  Data-
                 Sync  scans  the entire source and destination to verify that
                 both locations are fully synchronized.

              You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexi-
              ble  Retrieval  or  S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For
              more information, see Storage class considerations  with  Amazon
              S3 locations .
                 NONE  :  DataSync  doesn't run additional verification at the
                 end of the transfer. All data transmissions are still  integ-
                 rity-checked with checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  data  at  the destination location should be
              overwritten or preserved. If set to NEVER , a  destination  file
              for  example  will not be replaced by a source file (even if the
              destination file differs from the source file).  If  you  modify
              files  in  the  destination  and you sync the files, you can use
              this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some storage classes have specific  behaviors  that  can  affect
              your  Amazon  S3  storage  cost.  For  detailed information, see
              Considerations when working with Amazon S3  storage  classes  in
              DataSync .

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              a file was read or written to. If you set Atime to BEST_EFFORT ,
              DataSync  attempts  to  preserve the original Atime attribute on
              all source files (that is,  the  version  before  the  PREPARING
              phase of the task execution).

              NOTE:
                 The  behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT
                 BEST_EFFORT : Attempt to preserve the  per-file  Atime  value
                 (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Atime  is  set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be set to PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last  time
              that  a  file  was written to before the PREPARING phase of your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              Default Value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

                 NONE : Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer  value  of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE  :  Preserve  the integer value of UID and group ID
                 (GID) (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE . This preserves the integer  value  of
              the ID.
                 INT_VALUE  :  Preserve the integer value of user ID (UID) and
                 GID (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies whether files in the destination location  that  don't
              exist  in the source should be preserved. This option can affect
              your Amazon S3 storage cost. If your task deletes  objects,  you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Ignore such destination files (recommended).

                 REMOVE  :  Delete destination files that arent present in the
                 source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode  to  ALL  . When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't
                 scan your destination  location  and  doesn't  know  what  to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and character devices in the source location  and  recreate  the
              files  with  that  device  name and metadata on the destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices  be-
                 cause  they're  nonterminal  and  don't return an end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE
                 NONE : Ignore special devices (recommended).

                 PRESERVE : Preserve character and block device metadata. This
                 option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE
                 PRESERVE : Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

                 NONE : Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits  the  bandwidth  used by a DataSync task. For example, if
              you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set  this  value  to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during certain scenarios when running multiple tasks .  This  is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group,  see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              If  you  set LogLevel to OFF , no logs are published. BASIC pub-
              lishes logs on errors for individual files transferred. TRANSFER
              publishes  logs for every file or object that is transferred and
              integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata
              that  differ  between the source and the destination location or
              transfers all the content from  the  source  (without  comparing
              what's in the destination).
                 CHANGED  :  DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new
                 or different content from the source location to the destina-
                 tion location.

                 ALL : DataSync copies all source location content to the des-
                 tination (without comparing what's in the destination).

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies which components of the SMB  security  descriptor  are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File  Server  locations.  For more information, see how DataSync
              handles metadata .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't copy
                NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this option.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o The object owner.

              o NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which  deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to ac-
                cess a secured object. Copying SACLs requires  granting  addi-
                tional  permissions  to the Windows user that DataSync uses to
                access your SMB location. For  information  about  choosing  a
                user  that  ensures  sufficient permissions to files, folders,
                and metadata, see user .
                 NONE : None of the SMB  security  descriptor  components  are
                 copied.  Destination  objects  are owned by the user that was
                 provided for accessing the destination  location.  DACLs  and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  object  tags are preserved when transferring
              between object storage systems. If you want your  DataSync  task
              to ignore object tags, specify the NONE value.

              Default Value: PRESERVE

       Excludes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that exclude specific data during your trans-
          fer. For more information and examples, see  Filtering  data  trans-
          ferred by DataSync .

          (structure)
              Specifies  which  files,  folders, and objects to include or ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports  the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  single  filter string that consists of the patterns to in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       Includes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that include specific data during your trans-
          fer. For more information and examples, see  Filtering  data  trans-
          ferred by DataSync .

          (structure)
              Specifies  which  files,  folders, and objects to include or ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports  the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  single  filter string that consists of the patterns to in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the task execution was started.

       EstimatedFilesToTransfer -> (long)
          The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the net-
          work. This value is calculated during the PREPARING phase before the
          TRANSFERRING phase of the task execution. This value is the expected
          number of files to be transferred. It's calculated based on  compar-
          ing  the content of the source and destination locations and finding
          the delta that needs to be transferred.

       EstimatedBytesToTransfer -> (long)
          The estimated physical number of bytes that  is  to  be  transferred
          over the network.

       FilesTransferred -> (long)
          The  actual  number  of files that was transferred over the network.
          This value is calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during  the
          TRANSFERRING  phase of the task execution. It's updated periodically
          when each file is read from the source and sent over the network.

          If failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than Es-
          timatedFilesToTransfer  .  In  some  cases,  this  value can also be
          greater than EstimatedFilesToTransfer . This element is  implementa-
          tion-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indica-
          tor for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.

       BytesWritten -> (long)
          The number of logical bytes written to the  destination  Amazon  Web
          Services storage resource.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The total number of bytes that are involved in the transfer. For the
          number of bytes sent over the network, see BytesCompressed .

       Result -> (structure)
          The result of the task execution.

          PrepareDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in  the  PRE-
              PARING phase.

          PrepareStatus -> (string)
              The status of the PREPARING phase.

          TotalDuration -> (long)
              The  total  time  in milliseconds that DataSync took to transfer
