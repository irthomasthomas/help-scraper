OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          Specifies  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution that
          you want information about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TaskExecutionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the task execution that  you  wanted  information  about.
          TaskExecutionArn  is  hierarchical and includes TaskArn for the task
          that was executed.

          For example,  a  TaskExecution  value  with  the  ARN  arn:aws:data-
          sync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execu-
          tion/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b  executed  the   task   with   the   ARN
          arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2
          .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the task execution.

       Options -> (structure)
          Indicates how your transfer task is configured.  These  options  in-
          clude  how  DataSync  handles  files,  objects, and their associated
          metadata during your transfer. You also can specify  how  to  verify
          data  integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other op-
          tions.

          Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't  have
          to configure any option before calling StartTaskExecution .

          You also can override your task options for each task execution. For
          example, you might want to adjust the LogLevel for an individual ex-
          ecution.

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              Specifies  if and how DataSync checks the integrity of your data
              at the end of your transfer.

              o ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED (recommended) - DataSync calculates the
                checksum  of  transferred  data  (including  metadata)  at the
                source location. At the end of  the  transfer,  DataSync  then
                compares this checksum to the checksum calculated on that data
                at the destination.

              NOTE:
                     This is the default option for Enhanced mode tasks .

                 We recommend this option  when  transferring  to  S3  Glacier
                 Flexible   Retrieval  or  S3  Glacier  Deep  Archive  storage
                 classes. For more information, see Storage  class  considera-
                 tions with Amazon S3 locations .

              o POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT  -  At the end of the transfer, Data-
                Sync checks the entire source and destination to  verify  that
                both locations are fully synchronized.

              NOTE:
                     The  is the default option for Basic mode tasks and isn't
                     currently supported with Enhanced mode tasks.

                 If you use a manifest ,  DataSync  only  scans  and  verifies
                 what's listed in the manifest. You can't use this option when
                 transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or  S3  Glacier
                 Deep  Archive  storage  classes.  For  more  information, see
                 Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations .

              o NONE - DataSync performs data  integrity  checks  only  during
                your  transfer.  Unlike  other  options, there's no additional
                verification at the end of your transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the
              destination location.

              o ALWAYS  (default)  - DataSync modifies data in the destination
                location when source data (including metadata) has changed. If
                DataSync   overwrites  objects,  you  might  incur  additional
                charges for certain Amazon S3 storage  classes  (for  example,
                for  retrieval  or  early deletion). For more information, see
                Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 transfers .

              o NEVER - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination lo-
                cation  even  if the source data has changed. You can use this
                option to protect against overwriting changes made to files or
                objects in the destination.

          Atime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              a file was read or written to.

              NOTE:
                 The behavior of Atime isn't fully standard across  platforms,
                 so DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

              o BEST_EFFORT  (default)  -  DataSync  attempts  to preserve the
                original Atime attribute on all source  files  (that  is,  the
                version  before  the  PREPARING  steps of the task execution).
                This option is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If Atime is set to BEST_EFFORT , Mtime must be  set  to  PRE-
                 SERVE .

                 If Atime is set to NONE , Mtime must also be NONE .

          Mtime -> (string)
              Specifies  whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time
              that a file was written to before the  PREPARING  step  of  your
              task execution. This option is required when you need to run the
              a task more than once.

              o PRESERVE (default) - Preserves original Mtime , which is  rec-
                ommended.

              o NONE - Ignores Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is set to PRESERVE , Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT .

                 If Mtime is set to NONE , Atime must also be set to NONE .

          Uid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

              o INT_VALUE (default) - Preserves the integer value of  UID  and
                group ID (GID), which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync .

          Gid -> (string)
              Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

              o INT_VALUE  (default)  - Preserves the integer value of user ID
                (UID) and GID, which is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores UID and GID.

              For more information, see  Understanding  how  DataSync  handles
              file and object metadata .

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  files in the destination location that don't
              exist in the source should be preserved. This option can  affect
              your  Amazon  S3 storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you
              might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage
              classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when work-
              ing with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync .

              o PRESERVE (default) - Ignores such destination files, which  is
                recommended.

              o REMOVE  -  Deletes destination files that arent present in the
                source.

              NOTE:
                 If you set this parameter to REMOVE , you can't set Transfer-
                 Mode  to  ALL  . When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't
                 scan your destination  location  and  doesn't  know  what  to
                 delete.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block
              and character devices in the source location  and  recreate  the
              files  with  that  device  name and metadata on the destination.
              DataSync copies only the name and metadata of such devices.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices  be-
                 cause  they're  nonterminal  and  don't return an end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              o NONE (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).

              o PRESERVE - Preserves character and block device metadata. This
                option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
              purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

              For more information, see  Understanding  how  DataSync  handles
              file and object metadata .

              o PRESERVE  (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which
                is recommended.

              o NONE - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              Limits  the  bandwidth  used by a DataSync task. For example, if
              you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set  this  value  to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

              NOTE:
                 Not applicable to Enhanced mode tasks .

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue
              during certain scenarios when running multiple tasks .  This  is
              ENABLED by default.

          LogLevel -> (string)
              Specifies  the  type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs  log  group.  To  specify  the  log  group,  see
              CloudWatchLogGroupArn .

              o BASIC  -  Publishes  logs with only basic information (such as
                transfer errors).

              o TRANSFER - Publishes logs for all files or objects  that  your
                DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.

              o OFF - No logs are published.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  DataSync  transfers only the data (including
              metadata) that differs between locations  following  an  initial
              copy  or  transfers  all  data  every  time you run the task. If
              you're planning on recurring transfers, you might only  want  to
              transfer what's changed since your previous task execution.

              o CHANGED (default) - After your initial full transfer, DataSync
                copies only the data and metadata  that  differs  between  the
                source and destination location.

              o ALL - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destina-
                tion without comparing differences between the locations.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              Specifies which components of the SMB  security  descriptor  are
              copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows
              File  Server  locations. For more information, see Understanding
              how DataSync handles file and object metadata .

              o OWNER_DACL (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies
                the following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS  discretionary  access control lists (DACLs), which de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object. DataSync won't
                  copy  NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this op-
                  tion.

              o OWNER_DACL_SACL - For each copied object, DataSync copies  the
                following metadata:

                o The object owner.

                o NTFS  discretionary  access control lists (DACLs), which de-
                  termine whether to grant access to an object.

                o SACLs, which are used by administrators to log  attempts  to
                  access a secured object. Copying SACLs requires granting ad-
                  ditional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync  uses
                  to  access your SMB location. For information about choosing
                  a user with the right permissions, see required  permissions
                  for  SMB  ,  FSx  for Windows File Server , or FSx for ONTAP
                  (depending on the type of location in your transfer).

              o NONE - None of the  SMB  security  descriptor  components  are
                copied.  Destination  objects  are  owned by the user that was
                provided for accessing the  destination  location.  DACLs  and
                SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

          ObjectTags -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want DataSync to PRESERVE object tags (de-
              fault behavior) when transferring between  object  storage  sys-
              tems.  If  you  want  your  DataSync task to ignore object tags,
              specify the NONE value.

       Excludes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that exclude specific data during your trans-
          fer.  For  more  information and examples, see Filtering data trans-
          ferred by DataSync .

          (structure)
              Specifies which files, folders, and objects to  include  or  ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The  type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A single filter string that consists of the patterns  to  in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       Includes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that include specific data during your trans-
          fer.  For  more  information and examples, see Filtering data trans-
          ferred by DataSync .

          (structure)
              Specifies which files, folders, and objects to  include  or  ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The  type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A single filter string that consists of the patterns  to  in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       ManifestConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration of the manifest that lists the files or objects to
          transfer.  For more information, see Specifying what DataSync trans-
          fers by using a manifest .

          Action -> (string)
              Specifies what DataSync uses the manifest for.

          Format -> (string)
              Specifies the file format of your manifest.  For  more  informa-
              tion, see Creating a manifest .

          Source -> (structure)
              Specifies  the  manifest that you want DataSync to use and where
              it's hosted.

              NOTE:
                 You must specify this parameter if you're configuring  a  new
                 manifest on or after February 7, 2024.

                 If  you don't, you'll get a 400 status code and ValidationEx-
                 ception error stating that you're missing the  IAM  role  for
                 DataSync  to  access  the S3 bucket where you're hosting your
                 manifest. For more information, see Providing DataSync access
                 to your manifest .

              S3 -> (structure)
                 Specifies the S3 bucket where you're hosting your manifest.

                 ManifestObjectPath -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon S3 object key of your manifest. This
                     can include a prefix (for example, prefix/my-manifest.csv
                     ).

                 BucketAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
                     that allows DataSync to access your  manifest.  For  more
                     information,  see Providing DataSync access to your mani-
                     fest .

                 S3BucketArn -> (string)
                     Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket
                     where you're hosting your manifest.

                 ManifestObjectVersionId -> (string)
                     Specifies  the object version ID of the manifest that you
                     want DataSync to use. If you  don't  set  this,  DataSync
                     uses the latest version of the object.

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time when the task execution started.

       EstimatedFilesToTransfer -> (long)
          The  number of files, objects, and directories that DataSync expects
          to transfer over the network. This value is calculated  while  Data-
          Sync prepares the transfer.

          How  this  gets  calculated depends primarily on your tasks transfer
          mode configuration:

          o If TranserMode is set to CHANGED - The  calculation  is  based  on
            comparing  the content of the source and destination locations and
            determining the difference that needs to be transferred. The  dif-
            ference can include:

            o Anything that's added or modified at the source location.

            o Anything  that's  in both locations and modified at the destina-
              tion after an initial transfer (unless OverwriteMode is  set  to
              NEVER ).

            o (Basic task mode only) The number of items that DataSync expects
              to delete (if PreserveDeletedFiles is set to REMOVE ).

          o If TranserMode is set to ALL - The calculation is  based  only  on
            the items that DataSync finds at the source location.

       EstimatedBytesToTransfer -> (long)
          The  number  of  logical bytes that DataSync expects to write to the
          destination location.

       FilesTransferred -> (long)
          The number of files, objects, and directories that DataSync actually
          transfers  over the network. This value is updated periodically dur-
          ing your task execution when something is read from the  source  and
          sent over the network.

          If DataSync fails to transfer something, this value can be less than
          EstimatedFilesToTransfer . In some cases, this  value  can  also  be
          greater  than EstimatedFilesToTransfer . This element is implementa-
          tion-specific for some location types, so don't use it as  an  exact
          indication of what's transferring or to monitor your task execution.

       BytesWritten -> (long)
          The  number  of  logical  bytes that DataSync actually writes to the
          destination location.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The number of bytes that DataSync sends to the network  before  com-
          pression  (if  compression  is  possible).  For  the number of bytes
          transferred over the network, see BytesCompressed .

       BytesCompressed -> (long)
          The number of physical bytes that DataSync transfers over  the  net-
          work  after compression (if compression is possible). This number is
          typically less than BytesTransferred unless the data isn't compress-
          ible.

                     upload a task report to an Amazon S3 bucket .

          OutputType -> (string)
              Specifies the type of task report that you want:

              o SUMMARY_ONLY : Provides necessary details about your task, in-
                cluding  the  number of files, objects, and directories trans-
                ferred and transfer duration.

              o STANDARD : Provides complete details about your task,  includ-
                ing  a  full list of files, objects, and directories that were
                transferred, skipped, verified, and more.

          ReportLevel -> (string)
              Specifies whether you want your task report to include only what
              went  wrong  with  your transfer or a list of what succeeded and
              didn't.

              o ERRORS_ONLY : A report  shows  what  DataSync  was  unable  to

                and unable to transfer, skip, verify, and delete.

          ObjectVersionIds -> (string)
              Specifies whether your task report includes the new  version  of
              each  object transferred into an S3 bucket. This only applies if
              you enable versioning on your bucket . Keep in mind that setting
              this  to  INCLUDE  can increase the duration of your task execu-
              tion.

          Overrides -> (structure)
              Customizes the reporting level for aspects of your task  report.
              For  example,  your  report might generally only include errors,
              but you could specify that you want a list of successes and  er-
              rors  just  for  the  files that DataSync attempted to delete in
              your destination location.

              Transferred -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and

                     didn't  go  well  in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY ). At the
                     same time, you want to verify that your  task  filter  is
                     working  correctly. In this situation, you can get a list
                     of what files DataSync successfully skipped and if  some-
                     thing  transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Verified -> (structure)
                 Specifies the level of reporting for the files, objects,  and

                 ReportLevel -> (string)
                     Specifies whether your task report includes  errors  only
                     or successes and errors.

                     For  example,  your report might mostly include only what
                     didn't go well in your transfer (ERRORS_ONLY  ).  At  the
                     same  time,  you  want to verify that your task filter is
                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-
                     thing transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer  (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Deleted -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and
                 directories that DataSync attempted to delete in your  desti-

                     working correctly. In this situation, you can get a  list
                     of  what files DataSync successfully skipped and if some-
                     thing transferred  that  you  didn't  to  transfer  (SUC-
                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

              Skipped -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the level of reporting for the files, objects, and

                     CESSES_AND_ERRORS ).

       FilesDeleted -> (long)
          The number of files, objects, and directories that DataSync actually
          deletes  in  your  destination location. If you don't configure your
          task to delete data in the destination that isn't in  the  source  ,
          the value is always 0 .

       FilesSkipped -> (long)
          The  number  of  files, objects, and directories that DataSync skips
          during your transfer.

       FilesVerified -> (long)

          during your transfer.

          NOTE:
              When  you  configure  your  task  to verify only the data that's
              transferred , DataSync doesn't verify directories in some situa-
              tions or files that fail to transfer.

       ReportResult -> (structure)
          Indicates whether DataSync generated a complete task report for your
          transfer.

          Status -> (string)

              ated a report, or can't create a complete report.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              Indicates  the  code associated with the error if DataSync can't
              create a complete report.

          ErrorDetail -> (string)
              Provides details about issues creating a report.

       EstimatedFilesToDelete -> (long)
          The number of files, objects, and directories that DataSync  expects
          to  delete in your destination location. If you don't configure your
          task to delete data in the destination that isn't in  the  source  ,
          the value is always 0 .

       TaskMode -> (string)
          The  task mode that you're using. For more information, see Choosing

          comparing your source and destination locations.

          NOTE:
              Applies only to Enhanced mode tasks .

          This counter isn't applicable if you configure your task to transfer
          all data . In that scenario, DataSync  copies  everything  from  the
          source  to the destination without comparing differences between the
          locations.

       FilesListed -> (structure)
          The number of objects that DataSync finds at your locations.

          NOTE:

              o With  a manifest , DataSync lists only what's in your manifest
                (and not everything at your source location).

              o With an include filter , DataSync lists only what matches  the
                filter at your source location.

              o With  an  exclude  filter,  DataSync  lists everything at your
                source location before applying the filter.

          AtDestinationForDelete -> (long)
              The number of objects that DataSync finds  at  your  destination
              location.  This counter is only applicable if you configure your
