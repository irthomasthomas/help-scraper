OPTIONS
       --cmaf-package (structure) A CMAF packaging configuration.Encryption ->
       (structure)
              A CMAF encryption configuration.

              ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                 An optional 128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  represented  by  a
                 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for en-
                 crypting blocks. If you don't specify a  value,  then  Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder Key Exchange (SPEKE) service that  will  provide  en-
                 cryption keys.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0
                     relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification.  You  must  disable
                     key  rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIn-
                     tervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                     PresetSpeke20Video -> (string)
                        A collection of video encryption presets.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS El-
                     emental  MediaPackage  will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations.

              (structure)
                 An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional string to include in the name  of  the  mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The   interval   (in  seconds)  between  each  EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags  will  be  in-
                     serted  into  manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in out-
                     put manifests.

                 StreamSelection -> (structure)
                     A StreamSelection configuration.

                     MaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                        The maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     MinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                        The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     StreamOrder -> (string)
                        A directive that determines the order  of  streams  in
                        the output.

          IncludeEncoderConfigurationInSegments -> (boolean)
              When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, Medi-
              aPackage places your encoder's  Sequence  Parameter  Set  (SPS),
              Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) meta-
              data in every video segment instead of  in  the  init  fragment.
              This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets
              during content playback.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.

              When includeEncoderConfigurationInSegments is set to true, Medi-
              aPackage places your encoder's  Sequence  Parameter  Set  (SPS),
              Picture Parameter Set (PPS), and Video Parameter Set (VPS) meta-
              data in every video segment instead of  in  the  init  fragment.
              This lets you use different SPS/PPS/VPS settings for your assets
              during content playback.

          PeriodTriggers -> (list)
              A list of triggers that controls when the outgoing Dynamic Adap-
              tive  Streaming  over HTTP (DASH) Media Presentation Description
              (MPD) will be partitioned into multiple periods. If  empty,  the
              content  will  not  be partitioned into more than one period. If
              the list contains "ADS", new periods will be created  where  the

              Presentation  Description  (MPD).  When set to NUMBER_WITH_TIME-
              LINE, a full timeline is presented in each SegmentTemplate, with
              $Number$  media  URLs.  When  set  to TIME_WITH_TIMELINE, a full
              timeline is presented in each SegmentTemplate, with $Time$ media
              URLs.  When  set to NUMBER_WITH_DURATION, only a duration is in-
              cluded in each SegmentTemplate, with $Number$ media URLs.

                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0
                     relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification.  You  must  disable
                     key  rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIn-
                     tervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)

                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.

                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags  will  be  in-
                     serted  into  manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will be repeated in out-
                     put manifests.

                 StreamSelection -> (structure)

                     MinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                        The minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.

                     StreamOrder -> (string)
                        A directive that determines the order  of  streams  in
                        the output.

          IncludeDvbSubtitles -> (boolean)
              When  enabled,  MediaPackage passes through digital video broad-
              casting (DVB) subtitles into the output.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each fragment. Actual fragments will be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.

          UseAudioRenditionGroup -> (boolean)
              When  enabled,  audio streams will be placed in rendition groups
              in the output.

                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the following considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE  2.0
                     relies  on  the  CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable
                     key rotation for this endpoint by setting  keyRotationIn-

                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be in-
                     serted into manifests and no ID3Timed  Metadata  messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

                 cryption keys.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure  one  or
                     more  content encryption keys for your endpoints that use
                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the following considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be used for DASH endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE  2.0
                     relies  on  the  CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable
                     key rotation for this endpoint by setting  keyRotationIn-
