NAME
       list-packaging-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  collection  of  MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfiguration re-
       sources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-packaging-configurations is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: PackagingConfigurations

OPTIONS
       --packaging-group-id (string) Returns MediaPackage VOD PackagingConfig-
       urations associated with the specified PackagingGroup.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all packaging configurations

       The  following  list-packaging-configurations  example lists all of the
       packaging configurations that are configured  on  the  packaging  group
       named Packaging_group_1.

          aws mediapackage-vod list-packaging-configurations \
              --packaging-group-id Packaging_group_1

                        a 32-character string, used in  conjunction  with  the
                        key  for  encrypting  blocks.  If  you don't specify a
                        value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initial-

                        ager and Encoder Key  Exchange  (SPEKE)  service  that
                        will provide encryption keys.

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that
                            AWS Elemental MediaPackage will  assume  when  ac-

                        AdMarkers -> (string)
                            This  setting controls how ad markers are included
                            in the packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE"  will  omit
                            all   SCTE-35   ad   markers   from   the  output.
                            "PASSTHROUGH" causes the  manifest  to  contain  a
                            copy  of  the  SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken
                            directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming  (HLS)
                            manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                            and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the
                            input source.

                            An optional string to include in the name  of  the
                            manifest.

                        ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                            The  interval (in seconds) between each EXT-X-PRO-
                            GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests.  Addi-
                            tionally,  when  an interval is specified ID3Timed
                            Metadata messages will be generated every  5  sec-
                            onds  using the ingest time of the content. If the
                            interval is not specified, or set to  0,  then  no
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into
                            manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata  messages  will
                            be  generated.  Note that irrespective of this pa-
                            rameter, if any ID3 Timed  Metadata  is  found  in
                            HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed
                            through to HLS output.

                        RepeatExtXKey -> (boolean)
                            When enabled, the EXT-X-KEY tag will  be  repeated
                            in output manifests.

                        StreamSelection -> (structure)
                            A StreamSelection configuration.

                            MaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)
                               The  maximum  video bitrate (bps) to include in
