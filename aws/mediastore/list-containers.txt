LIST-CONTAINERS()                                            LIST-CONTAINERS()



NAME
       list-containers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the properties of all containers in AWS Elemental MediaStore.

       You can query to receive all the containers in one response. Or you can
       include the MaxResults parameter to receive a limited  number  of  con-
       tainers  in each response. In this case, the response includes a token.
       To get the next set of containers, send the command  again,  this  time
       with  the  NextToken  parameter (with the returned token as its value).
       The next set of responses appears, with a token if there are still more
       containers to receive.

       See  also   DescribeContainer  ,  which gets the properties of one con-
       tainer.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-containers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Containers

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Containers -> (list)
          The names of the containers.

          (structure)
              This section describes operations that you can perform on an AWS
              Elemental MediaStore container.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The  DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to iden-
                 tify the specific container when sending requests to the data
                 plane.  The  service assigns this value when the container is
                 created. Once the  value  has  been  assigned,  it  does  not
                 change.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Unix timestamp.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has
                 the following format:

                 arn:aws:<region>:<account  that  owns  this   container>:con-
                 tainer/<name of container>

                 For  example:  arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:con-
                 tainer/movies

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the container.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of container creation or deletion. The  status  is
                 one of the following: CREATING , ACTIVE , or DELETING . While
                 the service is creating the container, the status is CREATING
                 .  When  the endpoint is available, the status changes to AC-
                 TIVE .

              AccessLoggingEnabled -> (boolean)
                 The state of access logging on the container. This  value  is
                 false  by  default,  indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore
                 does not send access logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When you
                 enable  access  logging  on the container, MediaStore changes
                 this value to true , indicating that the service delivers ac-
                 cess  logs for objects stored in that container to CloudWatch
                 Logs.

       NextToken -> (string)
          NextToken is the token to use in the next call to  ListContainers  .
          This  token  is  returned only if you included the MaxResults tag in
          the original command, and only if there are still containers to  re-
          turn.
