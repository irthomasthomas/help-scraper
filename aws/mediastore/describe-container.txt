DESCRIBE-CONTAINER()                                      DESCRIBE-CONTAINER()



NAME
       describe-container -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  properties  of the requested container. This request is
       commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a
       value  assigned  by the service when a new container is created. A con-
       tainer's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned.  The  De-
       scribeContainer request returns a single Container object based on Con-
       tainerName . To return all Container objects that are associated with a
       specified AWS account, use  ListContainers .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-container
          [--container-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container to query.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the details of a container

       The following describe-container example displays the  details  of  the
       specified container.

          aws mediastore describe-container \
              --container-name ExampleContainer

       Output:

          {
              "Container": {
                  "CreationTime": 1563558086,
                  "AccessLoggingEnabled": false,
                  "ARN": "arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/ExampleContainer",
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "Name": "ExampleContainer",
                  "Endpoint": "https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
              }
          }

       For  more  information,  see Viewing the Details for a Container in the
       AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Container -> (structure)
          The name of the queried container.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to  identify
              the  specific container when sending requests to the data plane.
              The service assigns this value when the  container  is  created.
              Once the value has been assigned, it does not change.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              Unix timestamp.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has the
              following format:

              arn:aws:<region>:<account   that   owns   this   container>:con-
              tainer/<name of container>

              For    example:   arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:con-
              tainer/movies

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the container.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of container creation or deletion. The status is  one
              of  the  following:  CREATING , ACTIVE , or DELETING . While the
              service is creating the container, the status is CREATING . When
              the endpoint is available, the status changes to ACTIVE .

          AccessLoggingEnabled -> (boolean)
              The  state  of  access  logging  on the container. This value is
              false by default, indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore  does
              not  send access logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When you enable
              access logging on the container, MediaStore changes  this  value
              to  true  , indicating that the service delivers access logs for
              objects stored in that container to CloudWatch Logs.
