CREATE-SAFETY-RULE()                                      CREATE-SAFETY-RULE()



NAME
       create-safety-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  safety  rule  in  a control panel. Safety rules let you add
       safeguards around changing routing control states, and for enabling and
       disabling routing controls, to help prevent unexpected outcomes.

       There are two types of safety rules: assertion rules and gating rules.

       Assertion  rule:  An  assertion  rule  enforces that, when you change a
       routing control state, that a certain criteria is met. For example, the
       criteria  might  be that at least one routing control state is On after
       the transaction so that traffic continues to flow to at least one  cell
       for the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open scenario.

       Gating  rule: A gating rule lets you configure a gating routing control
       as an overall "on/off" switch for a group of routing controls. Or,  you
       can configure more complex gating scenarios, for example by configuring
       multiple gating routing controls.

       For more information, see Safety rules in the Amazon Route 53  Applica-
       tion Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --assertion-rule (structure)
          The assertion rule requested.

          AssertedControls -> (list)
              The  routing  controls  that  are  part of transactions that are
              evaluated to determine if a request to change a routing  control
              state  is  allowed. For example, you might include three routing
              controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the control panel.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The criteria that you set for specific assertion controls (rout-
              ing controls) that designate how many control states must be  ON
              as  the  result of a transaction. For example, if you have three
              assertion controls, you might specify ATLEAST 2  for  your  rule
              configuration.  This  means that at least two assertion controls
              must be ON, so that at least two  Amazon  Web  Services  Regions
              have traffic flowing to them.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest  against the target routing controls will fail. This helps
              prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms  by  de-
              fault, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AssertedControls=string,string,ControlPanelArn=string,Name=string,RuleConfig={Inverted=boolean,Threshold=integer,Type=string},WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AssertedControls": ["string", ...],
            "ControlPanelArn": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "RuleConfig": {
              "Inverted": true|false,
              "Threshold": integer,
              "Type": "ATLEAST"|"AND"|"OR"
            },
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string  of up to 64 ASCII characters. To
          make an idempotent API request with an action, specify a client  to-
          ken in the request.

       --gating-rule (structure)
          The gating rule requested.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          GatingControls -> (list)
              The  gating  controls  for the new gating rule. That is, routing
              controls that are evaluated by the rule configuration  that  you
              specify.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the new gating rule.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria that you set for specific gating controls (routing
              controls) that designate how many control states must be  ON  to
              allow you to change (set or unset) the target control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          TargetControls -> (list)
              Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the  specified
              RuleConfig  evaluates  to true for the specified GatingControls.
              For example, say you have three gating controls, one for each of
              three  Amazon Web Services Regions. Now you specify ATLEAST 2 as
              your RuleConfig. With these settings, you can only  change  (set
              or  unset)  the routing controls that you have specified as Tar-
              getControls if that rule evaluates to true.

              In other words, your ability to change the routing controls that
              you  have  specified as TargetControls is gated by the rule that
              you set for the routing controls in GatingControls.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest  against the target routing controls will fail. This helps
              prevent "flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms  by  de-
              fault, but you can choose a custom value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ControlPanelArn=string,GatingControls=string,string,Name=string,RuleConfig={Inverted=boolean,Threshold=integer,Type=string},TargetControls=string,string,WaitPeriodMs=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ControlPanelArn": "string",
            "GatingControls": ["string", ...],
            "Name": "string",
            "RuleConfig": {
              "Inverted": true|false,
              "Threshold": integer,
              "Type": "ATLEAST"|"AND"|"OR"
            },
            "TargetControls": ["string", ...],
            "WaitPeriodMs": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags associated with the safety rule.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              trols (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control
              states must be ON as the result of a transaction.  For  example,
              if  you have three assertion routing controls, you might specify
              ATLEAST 2 for your rule configuration. This means that at  least
              two  assertion  routing  control  states  must be ON, so that at
              least two Amazon Web Services Regions have  traffic  flowing  to

              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest against the target routing controls will fail. This  helps
              prevent  "flapping"  of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by de-

              For  a  simple  "on/off" switch, specify the ARN for one routing
              control. The gating routing controls are evaluated by  the  rule
              configuration  that you specify to determine if the target rout-
              ing control states can be changed.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the gating rule. You can use  any  non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria that you set for gating routing controls that des-
              ignate how many of the routing control states must be ON to  al-
              low you to update target routing control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              An  array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
              for which the states can only be updated if the rule  configura-
              tion  that  you specify evaluates to true for the gating routing
              control. As a simple example, if you have a single  gating  con-
              trol,  it acts as an overall "on/off" switch for a set of target
              routing controls. You can use this to  manually  override  auto-
              mated failover, for example.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest against the target routing controls will fail. This  helps
              prevent  "flapping"  of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by de-
              fault, but you can choose a custom value.
