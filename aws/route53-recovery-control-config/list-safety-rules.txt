LIST-SAFETY-RULES()                                        LIST-SAFETY-RULES()



NAME
       list-safety-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  safety  rules  (the  assertion  rules and gating rules) that
       you've defined for the routing controls in a control panel.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-safety-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: SafetyRules

OPTIONS
       --control-panel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       SafetyRules -> (list)
          The list of safety rules in a control panel.

          (structure)
              A  safety rule. A safety rule can be an assertion rule or a gat-
              ing rule.

              ASSERTION -> (structure)
                 An assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state
                 is  changed,  the  criteria  set by the rule configuration is
                 met. Otherwise, the change to the routing  control  state  is
                 not  accepted.  For  example,  the  criteria might be that at
                 least one routing control state is On after  the  transaction
                 so  that  traffic  continues to flow to at least one cell for
                 the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open sce-
                 nario.

                 AssertedControls -> (list)
                     The  routing  controls that are part of transactions that
                     are evaluated to determine if a request to change a rout-
                     ing  control state is allowed. For example, you might in-
                     clude three routing controls, one for each of three  Ama-
                     zon Web Services Regions.

                     (string)

                 ControlPanelArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name  of  the  assertion  rule. You can use any non-white
                     space character in the name.

                 RuleConfig -> (structure)
                     The criteria that you set for specific assertion  routing
                     controls (AssertedControls) that designate how many rout-
                     ing control states must be ON as the result of a transac-
                     tion.  For  example,  if you have three assertion routing
                     controls, you might specify ATLEAST 2 for your rule  con-
                     figuration.  This means that at least two assertion rout-
                     ing control states must be ON, so that at least two  Ama-
                     zon Web Services Regions have traffic flowing to them.

                     Inverted -> (boolean)
                        Logical  negation  of the rule. If the rule would usu-
                        ally evaluate true, it's evaluated as false, and  vice
                        versa.

                     Threshold -> (integer)
                        The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type.
                        That is, Threshold is the number of controls that must
                        be set when you specify an ATLEAST type.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A  rule  can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or
                        OR.

                 SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The deployment status of an assertion rule. Status can be
                     one  of  the  following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELE-
                     TION.

                 WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
                     An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during  which
                     any  request  against  the  target  routing controls will
                     fail. This helps prevent "flapping" of  state.  The  wait
                     period is 5000 ms by default, but you can choose a custom
                     value.

                 Owner -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID of the assertion  rule
                     owner.

              GATING -> (structure)
                 A  gating  rule verifies that a gating routing control or set
                 of gating routing controls, evaluates as  true,  based  on  a
                 rule  configuration  that  you specify, which allows a set of
                 routing control state changes to complete.

                 For example, if you specify one gating  routing  control  and
                 you  set the Type in the rule configuration to OR, that indi-
                 cates that you must set the gating routing control to On  for
                 the rule to evaluate as true; that is, for the gating control
                 "switch" to be "On". When you do that, then  you  can  update
                 the  routing  control  states for the target routing controls
                 that you specify in the gating rule.

                 ControlPanelArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

                 GatingControls -> (list)
                     An array of gating routing control Amazon Resource  Names
                     (ARNs). For a simple "on/off" switch, specify the ARN for
                     one routing control.  The  gating  routing  controls  are
                     evaluated  by  the rule configuration that you specify to
                     determine if the target routing  control  states  can  be
                     changed.

                     (string)

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  for the gating rule. You can use any non-white
                     space character in the name.

                 RuleConfig -> (structure)
                     The criteria that you set  for  gating  routing  controls
                     that  designate  how  many  of the routing control states
                     must be ON to allow you to update target routing  control
                     states.

                     Inverted -> (boolean)
                        Logical  negation  of the rule. If the rule would usu-
                        ally evaluate true, it's evaluated as false, and  vice
                        versa.

                     Threshold -> (integer)
                        The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type.
                        That is, Threshold is the number of controls that must
                        be set when you specify an ATLEAST type.

                     Type -> (string)
                        A  rule  can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or
                        OR.

                 SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The deployment status of a gating rule. Status can be one
                     of the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

                 TargetControls -> (list)
                     An  array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names
                     (ARNs) for which the states can only be  updated  if  the
                     rule configuration that you specify evaluates to true for
                     the gating routing control. As a simple example,  if  you
                     have  a  single  gating  control,  it  acts as an overall
                     "on/off" switch for a set of target routing controls. You
                     can use this to manually override automated failover, for
                     example.

                     (string)

                 WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
                     An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during  which
                     any  request  against  the  target  routing controls will
                     fail. This helps prevent "flapping" of  state.  The  wait
                     period is 5000 ms by default, but you can choose a custom
                     value.

                 Owner -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID  of  the  gating  rule
                     owner.
