CREATE-ROUTING-CONTROL()                              CREATE-ROUTING-CONTROL()



NAME
       create-routing-control -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new routing control.

       A  routing  control  has one of two states: ON and OFF. You can map the
       routing control state to the state of an Amazon Route 53 health  check,
       which can be used to control traffic routing.

       To  get  or  update the routing control state, see the Recovery Cluster
       (data plane) API actions for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery  Con-
       troller.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive  string  of up to 64 ASCII characters. To
          make an idempotent API request with an action, specify a client  to-
          ken in the request.

       --cluster-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the cluster that includes the
          routing control.

       --control-panel-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control  panel  that  includes
          the routing control.

       --routing-control-name (string)
          The name of the routing control.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  control  panel  that  in-
              cludes the routing control.
