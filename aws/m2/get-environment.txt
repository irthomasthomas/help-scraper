GET-ENVIRONMENT()                                            GET-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       get-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a specific runtime environment.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-environment
          --environment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --environment-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the runtime environment.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          standalone  runtime environment has a maxiumum of one instance. Cur-
          rently, a high availability runtime environment has a maximum of two
          instances.

          The timestamp when the runtime environment was created.

       description -> (string)
          The description of the runtime environment.

       engineType -> (string)
          The target platform for the runtime environment.

       engineVersion -> (string)
          The version of the runtime engine.

       environmentArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the runtime environment.

       environmentId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the runtime environment.

       highAvailabilityConfig -> (structure)
          The  desired capacity of the high availability configuration for the
          runtime environment.

          Indicates the pending maintenance scheduled on this environment.

          engineVersion -> (string)
              The  specific  runtime  engine that the maintenance schedule ap-

                 The time the scheduled maintenance is to start.

       preferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
          Configures a desired maintenance window for the environment. If  you
          do  not provide a value, a random system-generated value will be as-
          signed.

          licly accessible.

          time environment.

          (string)
