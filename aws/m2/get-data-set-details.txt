OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the application that this data set is asso-
          ciated with.

       --data-set-name (string)
          The name of the data set.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          The size of the block on disk.

       creationTime -> (timestamp)

       dataSetOrg -> (tagged union structure)
          The type of data set. Possible values include VSAM, IS, PS, GDG, PO,
          PS, or unknown.

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: gdg, vsam.

          gdg -> (structure)
              The generation data group of the data set.

              limit -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of generation data sets, up to 255, in a
                 GDG.

                 The disposition of the data set in the catalog.

          vsam -> (structure)
              The details of a VSAM data set.

              alternateKeys -> (list)
                 The alternate key definitions, if any. A legacy dataset might
                 not  have  any  alternate key defined, but if those alternate
                 keys definitions exist, provide  them  as  some  applications
                 will make use of them.

                 (structure)
                     Defines  an  alternate  key.  This  value  is optional. A
                     legacy data set might not have any alternate key  defined
                     but  if  those  alternate keys definitions exist, provide
                     them, as some applications will make use of them.

                     allowDuplicates -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the alternate key  values  are  sup-
                        posed to be unique for the given data set.

                     offset -> (integer)
                        A positive integer value representing  the  offset  to
                        mark the start of the alternate key part in the record
                        byte array.

              cacheAtStartup -> (boolean)
                 If set to True, enforces loading the data set into cache  be-
                 fore its used by the application.

              compressed -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether indexes for this dataset are stored as com-
                 pressed values. If you have a large data set (typically > 100
                 Mb), consider setting this flag to True.

              encoding -> (string)
                 The character set used by the data set. Can be ASCII, EBCDIC,
                 or unknown.

                 The primary key of the data set.

                 length -> (integer)

                     of the primary key.

                 name -> (string)
                     A name for the Primary Key.

                 offset -> (integer)
                     A  positive integer value representing the offset to mark
                     the start of the primary key in the record byte array.
