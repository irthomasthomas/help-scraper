PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    PUT-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       put-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a resource-based policy document to the resource, which can be
       a table or stream. When you attach a resource-based policy  using  this
       API,    the    policy    application   is   `   eventually   consistent
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html`__
       .
          PutResourcePolicy  is  an  idempotent operation; running it multiple
          times on the same resource using the same policy document  will  re-
          turn  the  same  revision  ID.  If you specify an ExpectedRevisionId
          which doesn't match the current policy's RevisionId , the PolicyNot-
          FoundException will be returned.

       NOTE:
          PutResourcePolicy  is  an asynchronous operation. If you issue a Ge-
          tResourcePolicy request immediately after  a  PutResourcePolicy  re-
          quest, DynamoDB might return your previous policy, if there was one,
          or return the PolicyNotFoundException . This is because GetResource-
          Policy  uses  an  eventually  consistent query, and the metadata for
          your policy or table might not be available at that moment. Wait for
          a few seconds, and then try the GetResourcePolicy request again.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DynamoDB resource to which the
          policy will be attached. The resources you can specify  include  ta-
          bles and streams.

          You  can control index permissions using the base table's policy. To
          specify the same permission level for your table  and  its  indexes,
          you can provide both the table and index Amazon Resource Name (ARN)s
          in the Resource field of a given Statement in your policy  document.
          Alternatively,  to specify different permissions for your table, in-
          dexes, or both, you can define multiple  Statement  fields  in  your
          policy document.

       --policy (string)
          An  Amazon  Web Services resource-based policy document in JSON for-
          mat.

          The maximum size supported for a resource-based policy  document  is
          20  KB.  DynamoDB  counts whitespaces when calculating the size of a
          policy against this limit. For a full  list  of  all  considerations
          that  you  should keep in mind while attaching a resource-based pol-
          icy, see Resource-based policy considerations .

       --expected-revision-id (string)
          A string value that you can use to conditionally update your policy.
          You  can provide the revision ID of your existing policy to make mu-
          tating requests against that policy. When you  provide  an  expected
          revision  ID,  if  the revision ID of the existing policy on the re-
          source doesn't match or if there's no policy  attached  to  the  re-
          source, your request will be rejected with a PolicyNotFoundException
          .

          To conditionally put a policy when no  policy  exists  for  the  re-
          source, specify NO_POLICY for the revision ID.

       --confirm-remove-self-resource-access   |  --no-confirm-remove-self-re-
       source-access (boolean)
          Set this parameter to true to confirm that you want to  remove  your
          permissions to change the policy of this resource in the future.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RevisionId -> (string)
          A unique string that represents the revision ID of  the  policy.  If
          you  are comparing revision IDs, make sure to always use string com-
          parison logic.
