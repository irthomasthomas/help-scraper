UPDATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()                                    UPDATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()



NAME
       update-global-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or removes replicas in the specified global table. The global ta-
       ble must already exist to be able to use this operation. Any replica to
       be  added  must  be empty, have the same name as the global table, have
       the same key schema, have DynamoDB Streams enabled, and have  the  same
       provisioned and maximum write capacity units.

       WARNING:
          This operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) of global
          tables. We recommend using Version 2019.11.21 (Current) when  creat-
          ing  new  global  tables, as it provides greater flexibility, higher
          efficiency  and  consumes  less  write  capacity   than   2017.11.29
          (Legacy).  To determine which version you are using, see Determining
          the  version  .  To  update  existing  global  tables  from  version
          2017.11.29  (Legacy)  to  version 2019.11.21 (Current), see Updating
          global tables .

       NOTE:
          This operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 of global  tables.
          If  you  are  using  global  tables  Version  2019.11.21 you can use
          UpdateTable instead.

          Although you can use UpdateGlobalTable to add  replicas  and  remove
          replicas  in  a single request, for simplicity we recommend that you
          issue separate requests for adding or removing replicas.

       If global secondary indexes are specified, then  the  following  condi-
       tions must also be met:

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same name.

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key
         (if present).

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same provisioned and maxi-
         mum write capacity units.

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The global table name.

       --replica-updates (list)
          A  list  of  Regions that should be added or removed from the global
          table.

          (structure)
              Represents one of the following:

              o A new replica to be added to an existing global table.

              o New parameters for an existing replica.

              o An existing replica to be removed from an existing global  ta-
                ble.

              Create -> (structure)
                 The parameters required for creating a replica on an existing
                 global table.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The Region of the replica to be added.

              Delete -> (structure)
                 The name of the existing replica to be removed.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The Region of the replica to be removed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Create={RegionName=string},Delete={RegionName=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Create": {
                "RegionName": "string"
              },
              "Delete": {
                "RegionName": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a DynamoDB global table

       The following update-global-table example adds a replica in the  speci-
       fied Region to the MusicCollection global table.

          aws dynamodb update-global-table \
              --global-table-name MusicCollection \
              --replica-updates Create={RegionName=eu-west-1}

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED - The replica is  inaccessible  because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for more than 20  hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this
                        replica  from  the replication group. The replica will
                        not be deleted and replication will stop from  and  to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If the KMS key remains inaccessible for more  than  20
                        hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this  replica from the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 ReplicaStatusDescription -> (string)
                     Detailed information about the replica status.

                 ReplicaStatusPercentProgress -> (string)
                     Specifies the progress of a Create, Update, or Delete ac-

                     cryption.

                 ProvisionedThroughputOverride -> (structure)

                     settings.

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        Replica-specific  read  capacity  units. If not speci-
                        fied, uses the source table's read capacity settings.

                 GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
                     Replica-specific global secondary index settings.

                     (structure)
