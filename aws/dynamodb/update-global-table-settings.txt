NAME
       update-global-table-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates settings for a global table.

       WARNING:
          For  global tables, this operation only applies to global tables us-
          ing Version 2019.11.21 (Current version),  as  it  provides  greater
          flexibility, higher efficiency and consumes less write capacity than
          2017.11.29 (Legacy). To determine which version you are  using,  see
          Determining the version . To update existing global tables from ver-
          sion  2017.11.29  (Legacy)  to  version  2019.11.21  (Current),  see

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The name of the global table

       --global-table-billing-mode (string)
          The  billing  mode of the global table. If GlobalTableBillingMode is
          not specified, the global table  defaults  to  PROVISIONED  capacity
          billing mode.

          o PROVISIONED - We recommend using PROVISIONED for predictable work-
            loads. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to  Provisioned  capacity
            mode .

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST  -  We  recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpre-
            dictable workloads.  PAY_PER_REQUEST  sets  the  billing  mode  to
            On-demand capacity mode .

          Possible values:

          o PROVISIONED

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST

       --global-table-provisioned-write-capacity-units (long)
          The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB re-
          turns a ThrottlingException.

       --global-table-provisioned-write-capacity-auto-scaling-settings-update
       (structure)
          Auto  scaling  settings  for managing provisioned write capacity for
          the global table.

          MinimumUnits -> (long)
              The minimum capacity units that a global table  or  global  sec-
              ondary index should be scaled down to.

          MaximumUnits -> (long)
              The  maximum  capacity  units that a global table or global sec-
              ondary index should be scaled up to.

          AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
              Disabled auto scaling for this global table or global  secondary
              index.

          AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
              Role ARN used for configuring auto scaling policy.

          ScalingPolicyUpdate -> (structure)
              The  scaling  policy to apply for scaling target global table or
              global secondary index capacity units.

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the scaling policy.

              TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Represents a target tracking scaling policy configuration.

                 DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking  policy
                     is  disabled.  If the value is true, scale in is disabled
                     and the target tracking policy won't remove capacity from
                     the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and
                     the target tracking policy can remove capacity  from  the
                     scalable resource. The default value is false.

                 ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in activity
                     completes before another scale in activity can start. The
                     cooldown  period is used to block subsequent scale in re-
                     quests until it has expired. You should scale in  conser-
                     vatively to protect your application's availability. How-
                     ever, if another alarm triggers a scale out policy during
                     the  cooldown  period  after a scale-in, application auto
                     scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

                 ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out  activ-
                     ity  completes  before  another  scale  out  activity can
                     start. While the cooldown period is in effect, the capac-
                     ity  that  has been added by the previous scale out event
                     that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of  the
                     desired  capacity for the next scale out. You should con-
                     tinuously (but not excessively) scale out.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     The  target  value  for  the   metric.   The   range   is
                     8.515920e-109  to  1.174271e+108  (Base  10) or 2e-360 to
                     2e360 (Base 2).

                        tion.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether scale in by the target  tracking
                            policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in
                            is disabled and the target tracking  policy  won't
                            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Other-

                            ity can start. The  cooldown  period  is  used  to
                            block  subsequent  scale  in requests until it has
                            expired. You should  scale  in  conservatively  to
                            protect  your application's availability. However,
                            if another alarm triggers a scale out policy  dur-
                            ing the cooldown period after a scale-in, applica-

                            is calculated as part of the desired capacity  for
                            the  next  scale out. You should continuously (but

                            The  minimum capacity units that a global table or
                            global secondary index should be scaled down to.

                        MaximumUnits -> (long)
                            The maximum capacity units that a global table  or
                            global secondary index should be scaled up to.

                        AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                            Disabled  auto  scaling  for  this global table or
                            global secondary index.

                        AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                            Role ARN used for configuring auto scaling policy.

                            The scaling policy to  apply  for  scaling  target
                            global  table  or  global secondary index capacity
                            units.

                            PolicyName -> (string)
                               The name of the scaling policy.

                            TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration        ->
                            (structure)

                                   get  tracking  policy won't remove capacity
                                   from  the  scalable  resource.   Otherwise,
                                   scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                                   policy can remove capacity from  the  scal-
                                   able resource. The default value is false.

                               ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                                   The  amount  of  time,  in seconds, after a
                                   scale in activity completes before  another
                                   scale  in  activity can start. The cooldown
                                   period is used to block subsequent scale in
                                   requests  until  it has expired. You should
                                   scale in conservatively to protect your ap-
                                   plication's  availability.  However, if an-
                                   other alarm triggers  a  scale  out  policy
                                   during   the   cooldown   period   after  a
                                   scale-in, application auto  scaling  scales
                                   out your scalable target immediately.

                               ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                                   The  amount  of  time,  in seconds, after a
                                   scale out activity completes before another
                                   scale  out  activity  can  start. While the
                                   cooldown period is in effect, the  capacity
                                   that  has  been added by the previous scale
                                   out event that initiated  the  cooldown  is
                                   calculated  as part of the desired capacity
                                   for the next scale out. You should continu-
                                   ously (but not excessively) scale out.

                               TargetValue -> (double)
                                   The  target value for the metric. The range
                                   is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
                                   or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

              ReplicaTableClass -> (string)
                 Replica-specific  table  class.  If  not  specified, uses the
                 source table's table class.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                               has expired. You should scale in conservatively
                               to  protect  your  application's  availability.
                               However, if another alarm triggers a scale  out
                               policy  during  the  cooldown  period  after  a

                               activity  can  start. While the cooldown period
                               is in effect, the capacity that has been  added
                               by  the previous scale out event that initiated

                               sired  capacity  for  the  next  scale out. You
                               should continuously (but not excessively) scale

                                   configuration.

                                   DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                                      Indicates whether scale in by the target
                                      tracking  policy  is  disabled.  If  the
                                      value is true, scale in is disabled  and
                                      the  target tracking policy won't remove
                                      capacity  from  the  scalable  resource.
                                      Otherwise,  scale  in is enabled and the
                                      target tracking policy can remove capac-
                                      ity  from the scalable resource. The de-
                                      fault value is false.

                                   ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                                      The amount of time, in seconds, after  a
                                      scale  in  activity completes before an-
                                      other scale in activity can  start.  The
                                      cooldown  period is used to block subse-
                                      quent scale in requests until it has ex-
                                      pired.  You  should  scale  in conserva-
                                      tively  to  protect  your  application's
                                      availability.  However, if another alarm
                                      triggers a scale out policy  during  the
                                      cooldown period after a scale-in, appli-
                                      cation  auto  scaling  scales  out  your
                                      scalable target immediately.

                                   ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                                      The  amount of time, in seconds, after a
                                      scale out activity completes before  an-
                                      other  scale  out  activity  can  start.
                                      While the cooldown period is in  effect,
                                      the  capacity that has been added by the
                                      previous scale out event that  initiated
                                      the  cooldown  is  calculated as part of
                                      the desired capacity for the next  scale
                                      out.  You  should  continuously (but not
                                      excessively) scale out.

                                   TargetValue -> (double)
                                      The target value  for  the  metric.  The
                                      range  is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108
                                      (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

              ReplicaTableClassSummary -> (structure)
                 Contains details of the table class.

                 TableClass -> (string)
                     The table class of the specified table. Valid values  are
                     STANDARD and STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS .

                 LastUpdateDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time at which the table class was last up-
                     dated.
