DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY()                              DELETE-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  resource-based policy attached to the resource, which can
       be a table or stream.
          DeleteResourcePolicy is an idempotent operation; running it multiple
          times  on the same resource doesn't result in an error response, un-
          less you specify an ExpectedRevisionId , which will  then  return  a
          PolicyNotFoundException .

       WARNING:
          To  make sure that you don't inadvertently lock yourself out of your
          own resources, the root principal in your Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
          count  can  perform  DeleteResourcePolicy requests, even if your re-
          source-based policy explicitly denies the root principal's access.

       NOTE:
          DeleteResourcePolicy is an asynchronous operation. If  you  issue  a
          GetResourcePolicy  request  immediately  after running the DeleteRe-
          sourcePolicy request, DynamoDB might still return the  deleted  pol-
          icy.  This  is  because  the policy for your resource might not have
          been deleted yet. Wait for a few seconds, and then  try  the  GetRe-
          sourcePolicy request again.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the DynamoDB resource from which
          the policy will be removed. The resources you  can  specify  include
          tables  and  streams.  If  you remove the policy of a table, it will
          also remove the permissions for the table's indexes defined in  that
          policy  document.  This  is because index permissions are defined in
          the table's policy.

       --expected-revision-id (string)
          A string value that you can use to conditionally delete your policy.
          When  you provide an expected revision ID, if the revision ID of the
          existing policy on the resource doesn't match or if there's no  pol-
          icy  attached  to  the  resource, the request will fail and return a
          PolicyNotFoundException .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RevisionId -> (string)
          A unique string that represents the revision ID of  the  policy.  If
          you're  comparing  revision IDs, make sure to always use string com-
          parison logic.

          This value will be empty if you make a request  against  a  resource
          without a policy.
