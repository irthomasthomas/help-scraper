OPTIONS
       --export-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the export.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ExportDescription -> (structure)
          Represents the properties of the export.

          ExportArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table export.

          ExportStatus -> (string)
              Export can be in one of the following states: IN_PROGRESS,  COM-
              PLETED, or FAILED.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task began.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task completed.

          ExportManifest -> (string)
              The name of the manifest file for the export task.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table that was exported.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique ID of the table that was exported.

          ExportTime -> (timestamp)
              Point in time from which table data was exported.

          ClientToken -> (string)
              The client token that was provided for the export task. A client
              token makes calls to  ExportTableToPointInTimeInput  idempotent,
              meaning  that  multiple  identical calls have the same effect as
              one single call.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket containing the export.

          S3BucketOwner -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  bucket
              containing the export.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket prefix used as the file name and path of
              the exported snapshot.

          S3SseAlgorithm -> (string)
              Type of encryption used on  the  bucket  where  export  data  is
              stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

              o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

              o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          S3SseKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  ID  of  the  KMS  managed key used to encrypt the S3 bucket
              where export data is stored (if applicable).

          FailureCode -> (string)
              Status code for the result of the failed export.

          FailureMessage -> (string)
              Export failure reason description.

          ExportFormat -> (string)
              The format of the exported data. Valid values  for  ExportFormat
              are DYNAMODB_JSON or ION .

          BilledSizeBytes -> (long)
              The billable size of the table export.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The number of items exported.
