DESCRIPTION
       Describes  auto scaling settings across replicas of the global table at
       once.

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view auto scaling settings across replicas of a global table

       The following describe-table-replica-auto-scaling example displays auto
       scaling settings across replicas of the MusicCollection global table.

                                      DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)

                                          target tracking policy is  disabled.
                                          If  the  value  is true, scale in is
                                          disabled  and  the  target  tracking
                                          policy  won't  remove  capacity from
                                          the  scalable  resource.  Otherwise,
                                          scale  in  is enabled and the target
                                          tracking policy can remove  capacity
                                          from  the scalable resource. The de-
                                          fault value is false.

                                      ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                                          The amount of time, in seconds,  af-
                                          ter  a  scale  in activity completes
                                          before another scale in activity can
                                          start.  The  cooldown period is used
                                          to block  subsequent  scale  in  re-
                                          quests  until  it  has  expired. You
                                          should scale  in  conservatively  to
                                          protect  your  application's  avail-
                                          ability. However, if  another  alarm
                                          triggers  a  scale out policy during
                                          the   cooldown   period   after    a
                                          scale-in,  application  auto scaling
                                          scales out your scalable target  im-
                                          mediately.

                                      ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)

                                   scale in conservatively to protect your ap-
                                   plication's availability. However,  if  an-
                                   other  alarm  triggers  a  scale out policy
                                   during  the   cooldown   period   after   a
                                   scale-in,  application  auto scaling scales
                                   out your scalable target immediately.

                               ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time,  in  seconds,  after  a
                                   scale out activity completes before another
                                   scale out activity  can  start.  While  the
                                   cooldown  period is in effect, the capacity
                                   that has been added by the  previous  scale
                                   out  event  that  initiated the cooldown is
                                   calculated as part of the desired  capacity
                                   for the next scale out. You should continu-
                                   ously (but not excessively) scale out.

                               TargetValue -> (double)
                                   The target value for the metric. The  range
                                   is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
                                   or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.
