CREATE-BACKUP()                                                CREATE-BACKUP()



NAME
       create-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a backup for an existing table.

       Each  time  you  create  an  on-demand backup, the entire table data is
       backed up. There is no limit to the number of  on-demand  backups  that
       can be taken.

       When  you  create  an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is
       cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously,  by  applying  all
       changes  until the time of the request to the last full table snapshot.
       Backup requests are processed instantaneously and become available  for
       restore within minutes.

       You can call CreateBackup at a maximum rate of 50 times per second.

       All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned through-
       put on the table.

       If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is
       guaranteed  to  contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00,
       and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain
       data modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup
       does not support causal consistency.

       Along with data, the following are also included on the backups:

       o Global secondary indexes (GSIs)

       o Local secondary indexes (LSIs)

       o Streams

       o Provisioned read and write capacity

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name
          (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

       --backup-name (string)
          Specified name for the backup.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a backup for an existing DynamoDB table

       The  following  create-backup example creates a backup of the MusicCol-
       lection table.

          aws dynamodb create-backup \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --backup-name MusicCollectionBackup

       Output:

          {
              "BackupDetails": {
                  "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01576616366715-b4e58d3a",
                  "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup",
                  "BackupSizeBytes": 0,
                  "BackupStatus": "CREATING",
                  "BackupType": "USER",
                  "BackupCreationDateTime": 1576616366.715
              }
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       BackupDetails -> (structure)
          Contains the details of the backup created for the table.

          BackupArn -> (string)
              ARN associated with the backup.

          BackupName -> (string)
              Name of the requested backup.

          BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
              Size of the backup in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approx-
              imately every six hours. Recent changes might not  be  reflected
              in this value.

          BackupStatus -> (string)
              Backup  can be in one of the following states: CREATING, ACTIVE,
              DELETED.

          BackupType -> (string)
              BackupType:

              o USER - You create and manage these using the on-demand  backup
                feature.

              o SYSTEM - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery en-
                abled, a SYSTEM backup is automatically  created  and  is  re-
                tained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System backups al-
                low you to restore the deleted table to the state  it  was  in
                just before the point of deletion.

              o AWS_BACKUP  - On-demand backup created by you from Backup ser-
                vice.

          BackupCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              Time at which the backup was created. This is the  request  time
              of the backup.

          BackupExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)
              Time at which the automatic on-demand backup created by DynamoDB
              will expire. This SYSTEM on-demand backup expires  automatically
              35 days after its creation.
