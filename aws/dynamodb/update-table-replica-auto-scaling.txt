OPTIONS
       --global-secondary-index-updates (list)
          Represents the auto scaling settings of the global secondary indexes
          of the replica to be updated.

          (structure)
              Represents the auto scaling settings of a global secondary index
              for a global table that will be modified.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the global secondary index.

              ProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingUpdate -> (structure)
                 Represents  the  auto  scaling  settings to be modified for a
                 global table or global secondary index.

                 MinimumUnits -> (long)
                     The minimum capacity units that a global table or  global
                     secondary index should be scaled down to.

                 MaximumUnits -> (long)
                     The  maximum capacity units that a global table or global
                     secondary index should be scaled up to.

                 AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Disabled auto scaling for this  global  table  or  global
                     secondary index.

                 AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                     Role ARN used for configuring auto scaling policy.

                 ScalingPolicyUpdate -> (structure)
                     The scaling policy to apply for scaling target global ta-
                     ble or global secondary index capacity units.

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The name of the scaling policy.

                     TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Represents a target tracking scaling policy configura-
                        tion.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether scale in by the target tracking
                            policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in
                            is  disabled  and the target tracking policy won't
                            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Other-
                            wise,  scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                            policy can remove capacity from the  scalable  re-
                            source. The default value is false.

                        ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale in
                            activity completes before another scale in  activ-
                            ity  can  start.  The  cooldown  period is used to
                            block subsequent scale in requests  until  it  has
                            expired.  You  should  scale  in conservatively to
                            protect your application's availability.  However,
                            if  another alarm triggers a scale out policy dur-
                            ing the cooldown period after a scale-in, applica-
                            tion  auto scaling scales out your scalable target
                            immediately.

                        ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale  out
                            activity completes before another scale out activ-
                            ity can start. While the cooldown period is in ef-
                            fect, the capacity that has been added by the pre-
                            vious scale out event that initiated the  cooldown
                            is  calculated as part of the desired capacity for
                            the next scale out. You should  continuously  (but
                            not excessively) scale out.

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            The  target  value  for  the  metric. The range is
                            8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360
                            to 2e360 (Base 2).

                     Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking  policy
                     is  disabled.  If the value is true, scale in is disabled
                     and the target tracking policy won't remove capacity from
                     the scalable resource. Otherwise, scale in is enabled and
                     the target tracking policy can remove capacity  from  the
                     scalable resource. The default value is false.

                 ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale in activity
                     completes before another scale in activity can start. The
                     cooldown  period is used to block subsequent scale in re-
                     quests until it has expired. You should scale in  conser-
                     vatively to protect your application's availability. How-
                     ever, if another alarm triggers a scale out policy during
                     the  cooldown  period  after a scale-in, application auto
                     scaling scales out your scalable target immediately.

                 ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale out  activ-
                     ity  completes  before  another  scale  out  activity can
                     start. While the cooldown period is in effect, the capac-
                     ity  that  has been added by the previous scale out event
                     that initiated the cooldown is calculated as part of  the
                     desired  capacity for the next scale out. You should con-
                     tinuously (but not excessively) scale out.

                 TargetValue -> (double)
                     The  target  value  for  the   metric.   The   range   is
                     8.515920e-109  to  1.174271e+108  (Base  10) or 2e-360 to

                     Role ARN used for configuring auto scaling policy.

                 ScalingPolicyUpdate -> (structure)
                     The scaling policy to apply for scaling target global ta-
                     ble or global secondary index capacity units.

                     PolicyName -> (string)
                        The name of the scaling policy.

                     TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Represents a target tracking scaling policy configura-
                        tion.

                        DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                            Indicates  whether scale in by the target tracking
                            policy is disabled. If the value is true, scale in
                            is  disabled  and the target tracking policy won't
                            remove capacity from the scalable resource. Other-
                            wise,  scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                            policy can remove capacity from the  scalable  re-
                            source. The default value is false.

                        ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale in
                            activity completes before another scale in  activ-
                            ity  can  start.  The  cooldown  period is used to
                            block subsequent scale in requests  until  it  has
                            expired.  You  should  scale  in conservatively to
                            protect your application's availability.  However,
                            if  another alarm triggers a scale out policy dur-
                            ing the cooldown period after a scale-in, applica-
                            tion  auto scaling scales out your scalable target
                            immediately.

                        ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale  out
                            activity completes before another scale out activ-
                            ity can start. While the cooldown period is in ef-
                            fect, the capacity that has been added by the pre-
                            vious scale out event that initiated the  cooldown
                            is  calculated as part of the desired capacity for
                            the next scale out. You should  continuously  (but
                            not excessively) scale out.

                        TargetValue -> (double)
                            The  target  value  for  the  metric. The range is
                            8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360
                            to 2e360 (Base 2).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update auto scaling settings across replicas of a global table

       The  following  update-table-replica-auto-scaling example updates write
       capacity auto scaling settings across replicas of the specified  global
       table.

          aws dynamodb update-table-replica-auto-scaling \
              --table-name MusicCollection \

                                          before another scale in activity can
                                          start.  The  cooldown period is used
                                          to block  subsequent  scale  in  re-
                                          quests  until  it  has  expired. You

                                          capacity for the next scale out. You
                                          should continuously (but not  exces-

                            Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

                            PolicyName -> (string)
                               The name of the scaling policy.

                            (structure)
                               Represents a  target  tracking  scaling  policy
                               configuration.

                               DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates  whether  scale  in by the target
                                   tracking policy is disabled. If  the  value
                                   is  true, scale in is disabled and the tar-
                                   get tracking policy won't  remove  capacity
                                   from   the  scalable  resource.  Otherwise,
                                   scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                                   policy  can  remove capacity from the scal-
                                   able resource. The default value is false.

                               ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time,  in  seconds,  after  a
                                   scale  in activity completes before another
                                   scale in activity can start.  The  cooldown
                                   period is used to block subsequent scale in
                                   requests until it has expired.  You  should
                                   scale in conservatively to protect your ap-
                                   plication's availability. However,  if  an-
                                   other  alarm  triggers  a  scale out policy
                                   during  the   cooldown   period   after   a
                                   scale-in,  application  auto scaling scales
                                   out your scalable target immediately.

                               ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                                   The amount of time,  in  seconds,  after  a
                                   scale out activity completes before another
                                   scale out activity  can  start.  While  the
                                   cooldown  period is in effect, the capacity
                                   that has been added by the  previous  scale
                                   out  event  that  initiated the cooldown is
                                   calculated as part of the desired  capacity
                                   for the next scale out. You should continu-
                                   ously (but not excessively) scale out.

                               TargetValue -> (double)
                                   The target value for the metric. The  range
                                   is 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10)
                                   or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

                 ReplicaProvisionedWriteCapacityAutoScalingSettings -> (struc-
                 ture)
                     Represents  the  auto scaling settings for a global table
                     or global secondary index.

                     MinimumUnits -> (long)
                        The minimum capacity units  that  a  global  table  or
                        global secondary index should be scaled down to.

                     MaximumUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  capacity  units  that  a global table or

                               DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates  whether  scale  in by the target
                                   tracking policy is disabled. If  the  value
                                   is  true, scale in is disabled and the tar-
                                   get tracking policy won't  remove  capacity
                                   from   the  scalable  resource.  Otherwise,
                                   scale in is enabled and the target tracking
                                   policy  can  remove capacity from the scal-
