DESCRIPTION
       Describes Region-specific settings for a global table.

       WARNING:
          This  documentation is for version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) of global ta-
          bles, which should be  avoided  for  new  global  tables.  Customers
          should use Global Tables version 2019.11.21 (Current) when possible,
          because it provides greater flexibility, higher efficiency, and con-
          sumes less write capacity than 2017.11.29 (Legacy).

          To  determine which version you're using, see Determining the global
          table version you are using . To update existing global tables  from
          version  2017.11.29  (Legacy)  to  version 2019.11.21 (Current), see
          Upgrading global tables .

          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The name of the global table to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The Region name of the replica.

              ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the Region:

                 o CREATING - The Region is being created.

                 o UPDATING - The Region is being updated.

                 o DELETING - The Region is being deleted.

                 o ACTIVE - The Region is ready for use.

              ReplicaBillingModeSummary -> (structure)
                 The read/write capacity mode of the replica.

                 BillingMode -> (string)
                     Controls how you are charged for read and write  through-
                     put  and  how  you  manage  capacity. This setting can be
                     changed later.

                     The maximum capacity units that a global table or  global
                     secondary index should be scaled up to.

                 AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Disabled  auto  scaling  for  this global table or global

                        TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration  ->   (struc-
                        ture)
                            Represents  a  target tracking scaling policy con-
                            figuration.

                            DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether scale in by the target track-
                               ing  policy  is disabled. If the value is true,
                               scale in is disabled and  the  target  tracking
                               policy  won't remove capacity from the scalable
                               resource. Otherwise, scale in  is  enabled  and
                               the  target tracking policy can remove capacity
                               from the scalable resource. The  default  value
                               is false.

                            ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale
                               in activity completes before another  scale  in
                               activity can start. The cooldown period is used
                               to block subsequent scale in requests until  it
                               has expired. You should scale in conservatively
                               to  protect  your  application's  availability.
                               However,  if another alarm triggers a scale out
                               policy  during  the  cooldown  period  after  a
                               scale-in,  application  auto scaling scales out
                               your scalable target immediately.

                            ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, after  a  scale
                               out activity completes before another scale out
                               activity can start. While the  cooldown  period
                               is  in effect, the capacity that has been added
                               by the previous scale out event that  initiated
                               the  cooldown  is calculated as part of the de-
                               sired capacity for  the  next  scale  out.  You
                               should continuously (but not excessively) scale
                               out.

                            TargetValue -> (double)
                               The target value for the metric. The  range  is
                               8.515920e-109  to  1.174271e+108  (Base  10) or
                               2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).

              ReplicaProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The maximum number of writes consumed per second  before  Dy-
                 namoDB  returns a ThrottlingException . For more information,
                 see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon  Dy-
                 namoDB Developer Guide .

              ture)
                 Auto scaling settings for a global table replica's write  ca-
                 pacity units.

                 MinimumUnits -> (long)
                     The  minimum capacity units that a global table or global
                     secondary index should be scaled down to.

                 MaximumUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum capacity units that a global table or  global
                     secondary index should be scaled up to.

                 AutoScalingDisabled -> (boolean)
                     Disabled  auto  scaling  for  this global table or global
                     secondary index.

                 AutoScalingRoleArn -> (string)
                     Role ARN used for configuring the auto scaling policy.

                 ScalingPolicies -> (list)
                     Information about the scaling policies.

                     (structure)
                        Represents the properties of the scaling policy.

                        PolicyName -> (string)
                            The name of the scaling policy.

                        TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration  ->   (struc-
                        ture)
                            Represents  a  target tracking scaling policy con-
                            figuration.

                            DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
                               Indicates whether scale in by the target track-
                               ing  policy  is disabled. If the value is true,
                               scale in is disabled and  the  target  tracking
                               policy  won't remove capacity from the scalable
                               resource. Otherwise, scale in  is  enabled  and
                               the  target tracking policy can remove capacity
                               from the scalable resource. The  default  value
                               is false.

                            ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
                               The  amount  of time, in seconds, after a scale
                               in activity completes before another  scale  in
                               activity can start. The cooldown period is used
                               to block subsequent scale in requests until  it

                               policy  during  the  cooldown  period  after  a
                               scale-in,  application  auto scaling scales out
                               your scalable target immediately.

                            ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
                               The amount of time, in seconds, after  a  scale
                               out activity completes before another scale out
