LIST-BACKUPS()                                                  LIST-BACKUPS()



NAME
       list-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       List  DynamoDB  backups that are associated with an Amazon Web Services
       account and weren't made with Amazon Web Services Backup. To list these
       backups  for  a  given table, specify TableName . ListBackups returns a
       paginated list of results with at most 1 MB worth of items in  a  page.
       You  can  also  specify a maximum number of entries to be returned in a
       page.

       In the request, start time is inclusive, but  end  time  is  exclusive.
       Note  that  these  boundaries  are  for  the time at which the original
       backup was requested.

       You can call ListBackups a maximum of five times per second.

       If you want to retrieve the complete list of backups made  with  Amazon
       Web Services Backup, use the Amazon Web Services Backup list API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-backups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: BackupSummaries

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The backups from the table specified by TableName are listed.

       --time-range-lower-bound (timestamp)
          Only backups created after this time are listed. TimeRangeLowerBound
          is inclusive.

       --time-range-upper-bound (timestamp)
          Only  backups  created  before this time are listed. TimeRangeUpper-
          Bound is exclusive.

       --backup-type (string)
          The backups from the table specified by BackupType are listed.

          Where BackupType can be:

          o USER - On-demand backup created by you. (The default setting if no
            other backup types are specified.)

          o SYSTEM - On-demand backup automatically created by DynamoDB.

          o ALL - All types of on-demand backups (USER and SYSTEM).

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o SYSTEM

          o AWS_BACKUP

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all existing DynamoDB backups

       The following list-backups example lists all of your existing backups.

          aws dynamodb list-backups

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  },
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-b2abc345",

                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-06-26T11:08:35.431000-07:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 400
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To list user-created backups in a specific time range

       The  following  example lists only backups of the MusicCollection table
       that were created by the user (not those automatically created  by  Dy-
       namoDB) with a creation date between January 1, 2020 and March 1, 2020.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --time-range-lower-bound 1577836800 \
              --time-range-upper-bound 1583020800 \
              --backup-type USER

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To limit page size

       The following example returns a list of all existing backups,  but  re-
       trieves only one item in each call, performing multiple calls if neces-
       sary to get the entire list. Limiting the page size is useful when run-
       ning  list commands on a large number of resources, which can result in
       a "timed out" error when using the default page size of 1000.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  },
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-b2abc345",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup2",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-06-26T11:08:35.431000-07:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 400
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 4: To limit the number of items returned

       The following example limits the number of items returned to 1. The re-
       sponse includes a NextToken value with which to retrieve the next  page
       of results.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --max-items 1

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",

                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 5: To retrieve the next page of results

       The following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call  to
       the list-backups command to retrieve another page of results. Since the
       response in this case does not include a NextToken value, we know  that
       we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

                   enabled,  a  SYSTEM  backup is automatically created and is
                   retained for 35 days (at no additional cost). System  back-
                   ups  allow you to restore the deleted table to the state it
                   was in just before the point of deletion.

                 o AWS_BACKUP - On-demand backup created by  you  from  Backup
                   service.

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 Size of the backup in bytes.

       LastEvaluatedBackupArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the backup last evaluated when the current page of re-
          sults was returned, inclusive of the current page of  results.  This
          value may be specified as the ExclusiveStartBackupArn of a new List-
          Backups operation in order to fetch the next page of results.

          If LastEvaluatedBackupArn is empty, then the last  page  of  results
          has been processed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          If LastEvaluatedBackupArn is not empty, this may or may not indicate
          that there is more data to be returned. All results  are  guaranteed
          to have been returned if and only if no value for LastEvaluatedBack-
          upArn is returned.
