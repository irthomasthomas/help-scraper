LIST-TABLES()                                                    LIST-TABLES()



NAME
       list-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of table names associated with the current account and
       endpoint. The output from ListTables is paginated, with each  page  re-
       turning a maximum of 100 table names.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-tables  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: TableNames

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list tables

       The following list-tables example lists all of  the  tables  associated
       with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws dynamodb list-tables

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Table Names in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To limit page size

       The following example returns a list of all existing  tables,  but  re-
       trieves only one item in each call, performing multiple calls if neces-
       sary to get the entire list. Limiting the page size is useful when run-
       ning  list commands on a large number of resources, which can result in
       a "timed out" error when using the default page size of 1000.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To limit the number of items returned

       The following example limits the number of items returned to 2. The re-
       sponse includes a NextToken value with which to retrieve the next  page
       of results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --max-items 2

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog"
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Table Names in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 4: To retrieve the next page of results

       The following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call  to
       the  list-tables command to retrieve another page of results. Since the
       response in this case does not include a NextToken value, we know  that
       we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Table Names in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       TableNames -> (list)
          The names of the tables associated with the current account  at  the
          current endpoint. The maximum size of this array is 100.

          If  LastEvaluatedTableName  also  appears in the output, you can use
          this value as the ExclusiveStartTableName parameter in a  subsequent
          ListTables request and obtain the next page of results.

          (string)

       LastEvaluatedTableName -> (string)
          The  name of the last table in the current page of results. Use this
          value as the ExclusiveStartTableName in a new request to obtain  the
          next page of results, until all the table names are returned.

          If  you  do  not  receive  a LastEvaluatedTableName value in the re-
          sponse, this means that there are no more  table  names  to  be  re-
          trieved.
