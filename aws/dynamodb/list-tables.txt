LIST-TABLES()                                                    LIST-TABLES()



NAME
       list-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of table names associated with the current account and
       endpoint. The output from ListTables is paginated, with each  page  re-
       turning a maximum of 100 table names.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-tables  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: TableNames

SYNOPSIS
            list-tables
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list tables

       The  following  list-tables  example lists all of the tables associated
       with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws dynamodb list-tables

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To limit page size

       The  following  example  returns a list of all existing tables, but re-
       trieves only one item in each call, performing multiple calls if neces-
       sary to get the entire list. Limiting the page size is useful when run-
       ning list commands on a large number of resources, which can result  in
       a "timed out" error when using the default page size of 1000.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog",
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For  more  information,  see Listing Table Names in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To limit the number of items returned

       The following example limits the number of items returned to 2. The re-
       sponse  includes a NextToken value with which to retrieve the next page
       of results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --max-items 2

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Forum",
                  "ProductCatalog"
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

       Example 4: To retrieve the next page of results

       The  following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call to
       the list-tables command to retrieve another page of results. Since  the
       response  in this case does not include a NextToken value, we know that
       we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-tables \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output:

          {
              "TableNames": [
                  "Reply",
                  "Thread"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Listing Table Names in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       TableNames -> (list)
          The  names  of the tables associated with the current account at the
          current endpoint. The maximum size of this array is 100.

          If LastEvaluatedTableName also appears in the output,  you  can  use
          this  value as the ExclusiveStartTableName parameter in a subsequent
          ListTables request and obtain the next page of results.

          (string)

       LastEvaluatedTableName -> (string)
          The name of the last table in the current page of results. Use  this
          value  as the ExclusiveStartTableName in a new request to obtain the
          next page of results, until all the table names are returned.

          If you do not receive a  LastEvaluatedTableName  value  in  the  re-
          sponse,  this  means  that  there  are no more table names to be re-
          trieved.
