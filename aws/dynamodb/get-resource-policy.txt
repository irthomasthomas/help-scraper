GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()                                    GET-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       get-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  resource-based  policy document attached to the resource,
       which can be a table or stream, in JSON format.
          GetResourcePolicy    follows    an    `    eventually     consistent
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html`__
          model. The following list describes the outcomes when you issue  the
          GetResourcePolicy request immediately after issuing another request:

       o If  you  issue a GetResourcePolicy request immediately after a PutRe-
         sourcePolicy request, DynamoDB might return a PolicyNotFoundException
         .

       o If   you  issue  a  GetResourcePolicy  request  immediately  after  a
         DeleteResourcePolicy request, DynamoDB might return the  policy  that
         was present before the deletion request.

       o If  you  issue  a  GetResourcePolicy request immediately after a Cre-
         ateTable request, which includes a  resource-based  policy,  DynamoDB
         might return a ResourceNotFoundException or a PolicyNotFoundException
         .

       Because GetResourcePolicy uses  an  eventually  consistent  query,  the
       metadata  for  your  policy or table might not be available at that mo-
       ment. Wait for a few seconds, and then retry the GetResourcePolicy  re-
       quest.

       After  a  GetResourcePolicy  request returns a policy created using the
       PutResourcePolicy request, you can assume the policy will start getting
       applied  in the authorization of requests to the resource. Because this
       process is eventually consistent, it will take some time to  apply  the
       policy  to  all  requests to a resource. Policies that you attach while
       creating a table using the CreateTable request will always  be  applied
       to all requests for that table.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DynamoDB resource to which the
          policy is attached. The resources you can specify include tables and
          streams.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Policy -> (string)
          The resource-based policy document attached to the  resource,  which
          can be a table or stream, in JSON format.

       RevisionId -> (string)
          A  unique  string  that represents the revision ID of the policy. If
          you are comparing revision IDs, make sure to always use string  com-
          parison logic.
