OPTIONS
       --configuration-id (string)
          Configuration ID of the server for which neighbors are being listed.

       --port-information-needed | --no-port-information-needed (boolean)
          Flag to indicate if port and protocol information is needed as  part
          of the response.

       --neighbor-configuration-ids (list)
          List of configuration IDs to test for one-hop-away.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return in a single page of output.

       --next-token (string)
          Token  to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you pre-
          viously specified 100 IDs  for  ListServerNeighborsRequest$neighbor-
          ConfigurationIds  but  set  ListServerNeighborsRequest$maxResults to
          10, you received a set of 10 results along with a  token.  Use  that
          token in this query to get the next set of 10.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       neighbors -> (list)
          List of distinct servers that  are  one  hop  away  from  the  given
          server.

          (structure)
              Details about neighboring servers.

              sourceServerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the server that opened the network connection.

              destinationServerId -> (string)
                 The ID of the server that accepted the network connection.

              destinationPort -> (integer)
                 The destination network port for the connection.

              transportProtocol -> (string)
                 The network protocol used for the connection.

              connectionsCount -> (long)
                 The  number  of open network connections with the neighboring
                 server.

       nextToken -> (string)
          Token to retrieve the next set of results. For example, if you spec-
          ified   100  IDs  for  ListServerNeighborsRequest$neighborConfigura-
          tionIds but set ListServerNeighborsRequest$maxResults to 10, you re-
          ceived  a set of 10 results along with this token. Use this token in
          the next query to retrieve the next set of 10.

       knownDependencyCount -> (long)
          Count of distinct servers that are  one  hop  away  from  the  given
          server.
