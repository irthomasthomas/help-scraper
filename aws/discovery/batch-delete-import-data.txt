BATCH-DELETE-IMPORT-DATA()                          BATCH-DELETE-IMPORT-DATA()



NAME
       batch-delete-import-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  one  or more import tasks, each identified by their import ID.
       Each import task has a number of records that can identify  servers  or
       applications.

       Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service has built-in matching
       logic that will identify when discovered servers match existing entries
       that  you've previously discovered, the information for the already-ex-
       isting discovered server is updated. When you  delete  an  import  task
       that contains records that were used to match, the information in those
       matched records that comes  from  the  deleted  records  will  also  be
       deleted.

OPTIONS
       --import-task-ids (list)
          The IDs for the import tasks that you want to delete.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --delete-history | --no-delete-history (boolean)
          Set  to true to remove the deleted import task from  DescribeImport-
          Tasks .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
