OPTIONS
       --delete-agents (list)
          The list of agents to delete.

          (structure)
              An object representing the agent or data collector to be deleted
              along with the optional configurations for error handling.

              agentId -> (string)
                 The ID of the agent or data collector to delete.

              force -> (boolean)
                 Optional flag used to force delete an agent or  data  collec-
                 tor.  It  is  needed  to  delete  any  agent  in  HEALTHY/UN-
                 HEALTHY/RUNNING status. Note that deleting an agent  that  is
                 actively  reporting health causes it to be re-registered with
                 a different agent ID after data  collector  re-connects  with
                 Amazon Web Services.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          agentId=string,force=boolean ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "agentId": "string",
              "force": true|false
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       errors -> (list)
          A  list of agent IDs that failed to delete during the deletion task,
          each paired with an error message.

          (structure)
              An object representing the agent or data collector  that  failed
              to delete, each containing agentId, errorMessage, and errorCode.

              agentId -> (string)
                 The ID of the agent or data collector to delete.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The  description  of  the  error that occurred for the delete
                 failed agent.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The type of error that occurred for the delete failed  agent.
                 Valid   status   are:   AGENT_IN_USE  |  NOT_FOUND  |  INTER-
                 NAL_SERVER_ERROR.
