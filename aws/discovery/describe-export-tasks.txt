DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  status of one or more export tasks. You can retrieve the sta-
       tus of up to 100 export tasks.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-export-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: exportsInfo

OPTIONS
       --export-ids (list)
          One or more unique identifiers used to query the status of an export
          request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters.

          o AgentId - ID of the agent whose collected data will be exported

          (structure)
              Used to select which agent's data is to be  exported.  A  single
              agent  ID  may  be selected for export using the StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentIds .

              values -> (list)
                 A single agent ID for a Discovery Agent. An agent ID  can  be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agent
                 ID is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       exportsInfo -> (list)
          Contains one or more sets of export request details. When the status
          of a request is SUCCEEDED , the response includes a URL for an  Ama-
          zon S3 bucket where you can view the data in a CSV file.

          (structure)
              Information  regarding the export status of discovered data. The
              value is an array of objects.

              exportId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier used to query an export.

              exportStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the data export job.

              statusMessage -> (string)
                 A status message provided for API callers.

              configurationsDownloadUrl -> (string)
                 A URL for an Amazon S3 bucket where you can  review  the  ex-
                 ported  data.  The  URL  is displayed only if the export suc-
                 ceeded.

              exportRequestTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the data export was initiated.

              isTruncated -> (boolean)
                 If true, the export of agent information  exceeded  the  size
                 limit for a single export and the exported data is incomplete
                 for the requested time  range.  To  address  this,  select  a
                 smaller time range for the export by using startDate and end-
                 Date .

              requestedStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The value of startTime parameter in the  StartExportTask  re-
                 quest.  If  no  startTime was requested, this result does not
                 appear in ExportInfo .

              requestedEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The endTime used in the StartExportTask request. If  no  end-
                 Time was requested, this result does not appear in ExportInfo
                 .

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a future  DescribeExportTasks  re-
          quest.  When  the  results  of  a DescribeExportTasks request exceed
          maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of re-
          sults. This value is null when there are no more results to return.
