START-EXPORT-TASK()                                        START-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Begins  the  export  of a discovered data report to an Amazon S3 bucket
       managed by Amazon Web Services.

       NOTE:
          Exports might provide an estimate of fees and savings based on  cer-
          tain  information that you provide. Fee estimates do not include any
          taxes that might apply. Your actual fees and savings depend on a va-
          riety of factors, including your actual usage of Amazon Web Services
          services, which might vary from the estimates provided in  this  re-
          port.

       If  you do not specify preferences or agentIds in the filter, a summary
       of all servers, applications, tags, and performance is generated.  This
       data is an aggregation of all server data collected through on-premises
       tooling, file import, application grouping and applying tags.

       If you specify agentIds in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of
       detailed  data collected by the identified Application Discovery Agent,
       including network, process, and performance details. A time  range  for
       exported  agent data may be set by using startTime and endTime . Export
       of detailed agent data is limited to five concurrently running exports.
       Export of detailed agent data is limited to two exports per day.

       If  you enable ec2RecommendationsPreferences in preferences , an Amazon
       EC2 instance matching the characteristics of each server in Application
       Discovery  Service is generated. Changing the attributes of the ec2Rec-
       ommendationsPreferences changes the criteria of the recommendation.

OPTIONS
       --export-data-format (list)
          The file format for the returned export data. Default value is CSV .
          Note:  The  GRAPHML  option has been deprecated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CSV

       --filters (list)
          If  a filter is present, it selects the single agentId of the Appli-
          cation Discovery Agent for which data is exported. The  agentId  can
          be found in the results of the DescribeAgents API or CLI. If no fil-
          ter is present, startTime and endTime are ignored and exported  data
          includes  both  Amazon  Web  Services  Application Discovery Service
          Agentless Collector collectors data and summary data  from  Applica-
          tion Discovery Agent agents.

          (structure)
              Used  to  select  which agent's data is to be exported. A single
              agent ID may be selected for export  using  the  StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentIds .

              values -> (list)
                 A  single  agent ID for a Discovery Agent. An agent ID can be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agent
                 ID is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  timestamp  for exported data from the single Application
          Discovery Agent selected in the filters. If no value  is  specified,
          data  is  exported  starting  from  the  first data collected by the
          agent.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end timestamp for exported data from the single Application Dis-
          covery  Agent selected in the filters. If no value is specified, ex-
          ported data includes the most recent data collected by the agent.

       --preferences (tagged union structure)
          Indicates the type of data that  needs  to  be  exported.  Only  one
          ExportPreferences can be enabled at any time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
