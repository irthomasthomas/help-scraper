START-EXPORT-TASK()                                        START-EXPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-export-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Begins the export of discovered data to an S3 bucket.

       If you specify agentIds in a filter, the task exports up to 72 hours of
       detailed data collected by the identified Application Discovery  Agent,
       including  network,  process, and performance details. A time range for
       exported agent data may be set by using startTime and endTime .  Export
       of detailed agent data is limited to five concurrently running exports.

       If you do not include an agentIds filter, summary data is exported that
       includes both Amazon Web Services Agentless  Discovery  Connector  data
       and  summary  data from Amazon Web Services Discovery Agents. Export of
       summary data is limited to two exports per day.

OPTIONS
       --export-data-format (list)
          The file format for the returned export data. Default value is CSV .
          Note:  The  GRAPHML  option has been deprecated.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CSV
            GRAPHML

       --filters (list)
          If  a filter is present, it selects the single agentId of the Appli-
          cation Discovery Agent for which data is exported. The  agentId  can
          be found in the results of the DescribeAgents API or CLI. If no fil-
          ter is present, startTime and endTime are ignored and exported  data
          includes  both  Agentless  Discovery Connector data and summary data
          from Application Discovery agents.

          (structure)
              Used to select which agent's data is to be  exported.  A  single
              agent  ID  may  be selected for export using the StartExportTask
              action.

              name -> (string)
                 A single ExportFilter name. Supported filters: agentIds .

              values -> (list)
                 A single agent ID for a Discovery Agent. An agent ID  can  be
                 found using the DescribeAgents action. Typically an ADS agent
                 ID is in the form o-0123456789abcdef0 .

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 Supported condition: EQUALS

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start timestamp for exported data from  the  single  Application
          Discovery  Agent  selected in the filters. If no value is specified,
          data is exported starting from  the  first  data  collected  by  the
          agent.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end timestamp for exported data from the single Application Dis-
          covery Agent selected in the filters. If no value is specified,  ex-
          ported data includes the most recent data collected by the agent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)
