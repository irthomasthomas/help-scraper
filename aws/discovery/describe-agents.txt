DESCRIBE-AGENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-AGENTS()



NAME
       describe-agents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  agents  or  connectors  as specified by ID or other filters. All
       agents/connectors associated with your user account can  be  listed  if
       you call DescribeAgents as is without passing any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-agents is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: agentsInfo

SYNOPSIS
            describe-agents
          [--agent-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-ids (list)
          The agent or the Connector IDs for which you  want  information.  If
          you  specify  no  IDs,  the  system  returns  information  about all
          agents/Connectors associated with your Amazon Web Services user  ac-
          count.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          You can filter the request using various logical operators and a key
          -value format. For example:
              {"key": "collectionStatus", "value": "STARTED"}

          (structure)
              A filter that can use conditional operators.

              For more information about filters, see Querying Discovered Con-
              figuration  Items in the Amazon Web Services Application Discov-
              ery Service User Guide .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 A string value on which to filter. For example, if you choose
                 the  destinationServer.osVersion filter name, you could spec-
                 ify Ubuntu for the value.

                 (string)

              condition -> (string)
                 A conditional operator. The following  operators  are  valid:
                 EQUALS,  NOT_EQUALS,  CONTAINS,  NOT_CONTAINS. If you specify
                 multiple filters, the system utilizes all filters  as  though
                 concatenated  by  AND  . If you specify multiple values for a
                 particular filter, the system differentiates the values using
                 OR  . Calling either DescribeConfigurations or ListConfigura-
                 tions returns attributes of matching configuration items.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string,condition=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...],
              "condition": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Describe agents with specified collectionStatus states

       This example command describes collection agents with collection status
       of "STARTED" or "STOPPED".
