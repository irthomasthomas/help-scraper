START-IMPORT-TASK()                                        START-IMPORT-TASK()



NAME
       start-import-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  import  task,  which  allows  you to import details of your
       on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub
       without  having  to  use  the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
       Service (Application Discovery Service) tools such as  the  Amazon  Web
       Services  Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector or Applica-
       tion Discovery Agent. This gives you the option  to  perform  migration
       assessment and planning directly from your imported data, including the
       ability to group your devices as applications and track their migration
       status.

       To start an import request, do this:

       o Download  the  specially formatted comma separated value (CSV) import
         template,        which        you        can        find        here:
         https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv
         .

       o Fill out the template with your server and application data.

       o Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make  a  note  of
         it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.

       o Use  the  console  or the StartImportTask command with the Amazon Web
         Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services  SDKs  to  import  the
         records from your file.

       For  more information, including step-by-step procedures, see Migration
       Hub Import in the Amazon Web  Services  Application  Discovery  Service
       User Guide .

       NOTE:
          There  are  limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and
          delete) in an Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see
          Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Limits in the Ama-
          zon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --client-request-token (string)
          Optional. A unique token that you can provide to  prevent  the  same
          import request from occurring more than once. If you don't provide a
          token, a token is automatically generated.

          Sending more than one StartImportTask request with the  same  client
          request token will return information about the original import task
          with that client request token.

       --name (string)
          A descriptive name for this request. You can use this name to filter
          future requests related to this import task, such as identifying ap-
          plications and servers that were included in this  import  task.  We
          recommend that you use a meaningful name for each import task.

       --import-url (string)
          The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              If  you're using the Amazon Web Services CLI, this URL is struc-
              tured as follows: s3://BucketName/ImportFileName.CSV

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       task -> (structure)
          An array of information related to the import task request including
          status information, times, IDs, the Amazon S3 Object URL for the im-
          port file, and more.

          importTaskId -> (string)
              The unique ID for a specific import task. These IDs aren't glob-
              ally unique, but they are unique within an Amazon  Web  Services
              account.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              A  unique token used to prevent the same import request from oc-
              curring more than once. If you didn't provide a token,  a  token
              was  automatically  generated  when  the import task request was
              sent.

          name -> (string)
              A descriptive name for an import task. You can use this name  to
              filter  future  requests  related  to  this import task, such as
              identifying applications and servers that were included in  this
              import  task.  We  recommend  that you use a meaningful name for
              each import task.

          importUrl -> (string)
              The URL for your import file that you've uploaded to Amazon S3.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the import task. An import can have the status  of
              IMPORT_COMPLETE  and still have some records fail to import from
              the overall request. More information can be found in the  down-
              loadable archive defined in the errorsAndFailedEntriesZip field,
              or in the Migration Hub management console.

          importRequestTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the import task request was made, presented in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          importCompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the import task request finished, presented in the
              Unix time stamp format.

          importDeletedTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the import task request was deleted, presented  in
              the Unix time stamp format.

          serverImportSuccess -> (integer)
              The  total number of server records in the import file that were
              successfully imported.

          serverImportFailure -> (integer)
              The total number of server  records  in  the  import  file  that
              failed to be imported.

          applicationImportSuccess -> (integer)
              The  total number of application records in the import file that
              were successfully imported.

          applicationImportFailure -> (integer)
              The total number of application records in the import file  that
              failed to be imported.

          errorsAndFailedEntriesZip -> (string)
              A  link  to a compressed archive folder (in the ZIP format) that
              contains an error log and a file of failed records. You can  use
              these  two  files  to  quickly identify records that failed, why
              they failed, and correct those records. Afterward, you  can  up-
              load  the corrected file to your Amazon S3 bucket and create an-
              other import task request.

              This field also includes authorization information  so  you  can
              confirm  the  authenticity  of the compressed archive before you
              download it.

              If some records failed to be imported we recommend that you cor-
              rect  the  records  in  the failed entries file and then imports
              that failed entries file. This prevents you from having to  cor-
              rect  and  update the larger original file and attempt importing
              it again.
