          with \n .

          Key-value pairs to configure log publishing.

          IsLoggingEnabled -> (boolean)
              Whether logs should be published.

          CloudWatchLogDestination -> (structure)
              The  destination  for  OpenSearch  Ingestion logs sent to Amazon
              CloudWatch Logs. This parameter is required if  IsLoggingEnabled
              is set to true .

              LogGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of the CloudWatch Logs group to send pipeline logs
                 to. You can specify an existing log group  or  create  a  new
                 one. For example, /aws/vendedlogs/OpenSearchService/pipelines
                 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IsLoggingEnabled=boolean,CloudWatchLogDestination={LogGroup=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IsLoggingEnabled": true|false,

          Key-value pairs to configure persistent buffering for the pipeline.

          PersistentBufferEnabled -> (boolean)
              Whether persistent buffering should be enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PersistentBufferEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PersistentBufferEnabled": true|false
          }

       --encryption-at-rest-options (structure)
          Key-value pairs to configure encryption for data that is written  to
          a persistent buffer.

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)

              data is encrypted using an Amazon Web Services owned key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KmsKeyArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KmsKeyArn": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
