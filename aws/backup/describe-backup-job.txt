OPTIONS
       --backup-job-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a resource.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains identifying information about the creation of a backup job,
          including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId , BackupPlanVersion , and
          BackupRuleId of the backup plan that is used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)

              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs are unique, randomly generated, Unicode,  UTF-8  en-
              coded  strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be
              edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a  se-
              lection of resources.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for exam-

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The size in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time that the
          job status was queried.

       ExpectedCompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to back up resources is expected to  be
          completed,  in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
          value of ExpectedCompletionDate is accurate to milliseconds. For ex-
          ample,  the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

          Specifies the time in Unix format  and  Coordinated  Universal  Time
          (UTC)  when  a backup job must be started before it is canceled. The
          value is calculated by adding the  start  window  to  the  scheduled
          time.  So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM and the start window is
          2 hours, the StartBy time would be 8:00 PM on  the  date  specified.
          The  value  of StartBy is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
          value   1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupType -> (string)
          Represents the actual backup type selected for a backup job. For ex-
          ample,  if  a  successful  Windows  Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)
          backup was taken, BackupType returns "WindowsVSS" . If BackupType is
          empty, then the backup type was a regular backup.

       ParentJobId -> (string)
          This returns the parent (composite) resource backup job ID.

          This returns the number of child (nested) backup jobs.

       ChildJobsInState -> (map)
          This returns the statistics of the included  child  (nested)  backup
          jobs.
