NAME
       update-recovery-point-lifecycle -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets the transition lifecycle of a recovery point.

       The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
       storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups au-
       tomatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

       Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
       a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting must be 90  days
       greater  than the transition to cold after days setting. The transition
       to cold after days setting cannot be changed after a  backup  has  been
       transitioned to cold.

       Resource  types  that  are  able to be transitioned to cold storage are
       listed in the "Lifecycle to cold storage" section of the Feature avail-
       ability by resource table. Backup ignores this expression for other re-
       source types.

       This operation does not support continuous backups.

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --lifecycle (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires.  Backup  transitions  and  expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups  transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage
          for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting  must  be
          90  days greater than the transition to cold after days setting. The
          transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed  after  a
          backup has been transitioned to cold.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery
          point;   for  example,  arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  transitioned  to
          cold  storage  and  when  it expires. Backup transitions and expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold  storage
          for  a  minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting must be
          90 days greater than the transition to cold after days setting.  The
          transition  to  cold  after  days  setting cannot be changed after a
          backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage  are
          listed  in  the  "Lifecycle  to cold storage" section of the Feature

              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.
