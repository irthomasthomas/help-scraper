OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          This is the name of the vault that is being created.

       --backup-vault-tags (map)
          These are the tags that will be included in the newly-created vault.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --creator-request-id (string)
          This is the ID of the creation request.

       --min-retention-days (long)
          This  setting  specifies the minimum retention period that the vault
          retains its recovery points. If this parameter is not specified,  no
          minimum retention period is enforced.

          If  specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a life-
          cycle policy with a retention period equal to  or  longer  than  the
          minimum  retention period. If a job retention period is shorter than
          that minimum retention period, then the vault fails  the  backup  or
          copy  job,  and  you should either modify your lifecycle settings or
          use a different vault.

       --max-retention-days (long)
          This is the setting that specifies the maximum retention period that
          the  vault  retains  its  recovery  points. If this parameter is not
          specified, Backup does not enforce a maximum retention period on the
          recovery points in the vault (allowing indefinite storage).

          If  specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a life-
          cycle policy with a retention period equal to or  shorter  than  the
          maximum retention period. If the job retention period is longer than
          that maximum retention period, then the vault fails  the  backup  or
          copy  job,  and  you should either modify your lifecycle settings or
          use a different vault.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       o on

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name of a logical container where backups are stored. Logically
          air-gapped backup vaults are identified by names that are unique  to
          the  account  used to create them and the Region where they are cre-
          ated. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          This is the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the vault being created.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the vault was created.

          This value is in Unix format, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),  and
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       VaultState -> (string)
          This is the current state of the vault.
