OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where backups are stored.  Logically
          air-gapped  backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to
          the account used to create them and the Region where they  are  cre-
          ated.

       --backup-vault-tags (map)
          The tags to assign to the vault.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --creator-request-id (string)
          The ID of the creation request.

          This  parameter  is optional. If used, this parameter must contain 1
          to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

       --min-retention-days (long)
          This setting specifies the minimum retention period that  the  vault
          retains its recovery points.

          The minimum value accepted is 7 days.

       --max-retention-days (long)
          The  maximum  retention  period  that the vault retains its recovery
          points.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The name of a logical container where backups are stored.  Logically
          air-gapped  backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to
          the account used to create them and the Region where they  are  cre-
          ated.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the vault.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the vault was created.

          This  value is in Unix format, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       VaultState -> (string)
          The current state of the vault.
