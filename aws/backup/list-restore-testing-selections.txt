NAME
       list-restore-testing-selections -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of restore testing selections. Can be filtered by MaxRe-
       sults and RestoreTestingPlanName .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-restore-testing-selections is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: RestoreTestingSelections

OPTIONS
       --restore-testing-plan-name (string)
          Returns  restore testing selections by the specified restore testing
          plan name.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return MaxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the nexttoken.

       RestoreTestingSelections -> (list)
          The  returned restore testing selections associated with the restore
          testing plan.

          (structure)
              This contains metadata about a restore testing selection.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 This is the date and time that a  restore  testing  selection
                 was  created,  in  Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time
                 (UTC). The value of CreationTime is accurate to milliseconds.
                 For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, Jan-
                 uary 26,2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  Backup
                 uses   to   create   the   target   resource;   for  example:
                 arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

              ProtectedResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services resource included  in  a  re-
                 store testing selection; for example, an Amazon EBS volume or
                 an Amazon RDS database.

              RestoreTestingPlanName -> (string)
                 Unique string that is the name of the restore testing plan.

                 The name cannot be changed after creation. The name must con-
                 sist of only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Maximum
                 length is 50.

              RestoreTestingSelectionName -> (string)
                 Unique name of a restore testing selection.

              ValidationWindowHours -> (integer)
                 This value represents the time, in hours,  data  is  retained
                 after  a restore test so that optional validation can be com-
                 pleted.

                 Accepted value is an integer between 0 and  168  (the  hourly
                 equivalent of seven days).
