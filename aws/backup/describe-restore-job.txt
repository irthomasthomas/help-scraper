OPTIONS
       --restore-job-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the job that restores a recovery point.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

       is 60 seconds.

       PercentDone -> (string)
          Contains  an  estimated  percentage that is complete of a job at the
          time the job status was queried.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of the restored resource.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;

       ExpectedCompletionTimeMinutes -> (long)
          The  amount of time in minutes that a job restoring a recovery point
          is expected to take.

       CreatedResourceArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that was  created  by

          resource.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          Returns metadata associated with a restore job  listed  by  resource
          type.

       RecoveryPointCreationDate -> (timestamp)
