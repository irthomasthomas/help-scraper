OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-template-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a stored backup plan template.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get an existing backup plan from a template

       The following get-backup-plan-from-template example  gets  an  existing
       backup plan from a template that specifies a daily backup with a 35 day
       retention.

          aws backup get-backup-plan-from-template \
              --backup-plan-template-id "87c0c1ef-254d-4180-8fef-2e76a2c38aaa"

       Output:

          {
              "BackupPlanDocument": {
                  "Rules": [
                      {
                          "RuleName": "DailyBackups",
                          "ScheduleExpression": "cron(0 5 ? * * *)",
                          "StartWindowMinutes": 480,
                          "Lifecycle": {
                              "DeleteAfterDays": 35
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       BackupPlanDocument -> (structure)
          Returns  the body of a backup plan based on the target template, in-
          cluding the name, rules, and backup vault of the plan.

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must  contain  only  alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' special characters.

              If  this  is  set in the console, it can contain 1 to 50 charac-
              ters; if this is set through CLI or API, it can contain 1 to 200
              characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of re-
                 sources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A  display  name  for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup  vaults are identified by names that are unique to
                     the account used to create them and the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A cron expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job. For more information about Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  cron  expressions,  see  Schedule  Expressions for
                     Rules in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.  .  Two
                     examples of Amazon Web Services cron expressions are 15 *
                     ? * * * (take a backup every hour at 15 minutes past  the
                     hour)  and  0  12  * * ? * (take a backup every day at 12
                     noon UTC). For a table of examples, click  the  preceding
                     link and scroll down the page.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a
                     job will be canceled if it  doesn't  start  successfully.
                     This  value  is  optional.  If this value is included, it
                     must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

                     During the start window, the backup job status remains in
                     CREATED  status  until it has successfully begun or until
                     the start window time has run out. If  within  the  start
                     window  time Backup receives an error that allows the job
                     to be retried, Backup will automatically retry  to  begin
                     the  job  at least every 10 minutes until the backup suc-
                     cessfully begins (the job status changes to RUNNING )  or
                     until  the  job  status  changes to EXPIRED (which is ex-
                     pected to occur when the start window time is over).

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A value in minutes after a  backup  job  is  successfully
                     started  before  it  must be completed or it will be can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  tran-
                     sitioned  to  cold  storage  and  when it expires. Backup
                     transitions and expires backups  automatically  according
                     to the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups  transitioned  to  cold storage must be stored in
                     cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the re-
                     tention  setting must be 90 days greater than the transi-
                     tion to cold after days setting. The transition  to  cold
                     after  days  setting cannot be changed after a backup has
                     been transitioned to cold.

                     Resource types that can transition to  cold  storage  are
                     listed  in  the  Feature  availability by resource table.
                     Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        The number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
                        point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        The  number  of  days  after  creation that a recovery
                        point is deleted. This value must be at least 90  days
                        after  the number of days specified in MoveToColdStor-
                        ageAfterDays .

                     OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources -> (boolean)
                        If the value is true,  your  backup  plan  transitions
                        supported  resources to archive (cold) storage tier in
                        accordance with your lifecycle settings.

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     The tags that are assigned to resources that are  associ-
                     ated with this rule when restored from backup.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     Uniquely  identifies  a rule that is used to schedule the
                     backup of a selection of resources.

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An array of CopyAction objects, which  contains  the  de-
                     tails of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Specifies  the  time period, in days, before a re-
                            covery point transitions to  cold  storage  or  is
                            deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored in cold storage for a minimum of  90  days.
                            Therefore,  on  the console, the retention setting
                            must be 90 days greater  than  the  transition  to
                            cold  after  days  setting. The transition to cold
                            after days setting can't be changed after a backup
                            has been transitioned to cold.

                            Resource types that can transition to cold storage
                            are listed in the Feature availability by resource
                            table.  Backup  ignores  this expression for other
                            resource types.

                            To remove the existing lifecycle and retention pe-
                            riods  and keep your recovery points indefinitely,
                            specify  -1  for  MoveToColdStorageAfterDays   and
                            DeleteAfterDays .

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               The number of days after creation that a recov-
                               ery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               The number of days after creation that a recov-
                               ery  point  is  deleted.  This value must be at
                               least 90 days after the number of  days  speci-
                               fied in MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                            OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources -> (boolean)
                               If  the value is true, your backup plan transi-
                               tions supported  resources  to  archive  (cold)
                               storage  tier in accordance with your lifecycle
                               settings.

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes  Backup  to  create  continuous backups capable of
                     point-in-time restore (PITR). False  (or  not  specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

                 ScheduleExpressionTimezone -> (string)
                     The  timezone in which the schedule expression is set. By
                     default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You  can  modify
                     this to a specified timezone.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Contains a list of BackupOptions for each resource type.

              (structure)
                 The backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies  an  object containing resource type and backup
                     options. The only supported resource type is  Amazon  EC2
                     instances  with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

                     tion  template  to  enable Windows VSS in the Backup User
                     Guide .

                     Valid values: EC2 .

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to enable the WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a   regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.

                     If  you  specify an invalid option, you get an InvalidPa-
                     rameterValueException exception.
