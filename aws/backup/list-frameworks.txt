OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The number of desired results from 1 to 1000. Optional. If  unspeci-
          fied, the query will return 1 MB of data.

       --next-token (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Frameworks -> (list)
          The frameworks with details for each framework, including the frame-
          work name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), description, number  of  con-
          trols, creation time, and deployment status.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about a framework. Frameworks con-
              tain controls, which evaluate and report on your  backup  events
              and resources. Frameworks generate daily compliance results.

              FrameworkName -> (string)
                 The  unique  name  of a framework. This name is between 1 and
                 256 characters, starting with a  letter,  and  consisting  of
                 letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).

              FrameworkArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a re-
                 source. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              FrameworkDescription -> (string)
                 An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024
                 characters.

              NumberOfControls -> (integer)
                 The number of controls contained by the framework.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time that a framework is created, in ISO 8601
                 representation. The value of CreationTime is accurate to mil-
                 liseconds.  For example, 2020-07-10T15:00:00.000-08:00 repre-
                 sents the 10th of July 2020 at 3:00 PM 8 hours behind UTC.

              DeploymentStatus -> (string)
                 The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are:
                     CREATE_IN_PROGRESS      |      UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS       |
                     DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | FAILED

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.
