DESCRIPTION

       The first of two steps to create a restore testing plan. After this re-
       quest is successful, finish the procedure using CreateRestoreTestingSe-
       lection.

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          This  is  a  unique  string  that  identifies the request and allows
          failed requests to be retriedwithout the risk of running the  opera-
          tion twice. This parameter is optional. If used, this parameter must
          contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

       --restore-testing-plan (structure)
          A restore testing plan must contain a unique  RestoreTestingPlanName
          string  you  create  and must contain a ScheduleExpression cron. You
          may optionally include a StartWindowHours integer and  a  CreatorRe-
          questId string.

          The  RestoreTestingPlanName  is  a unique string that is the name of
          the restore testing plan. This cannot be changed after creation, and
          it must consist of only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

          RecoveryPointSelection -> (structure)
                 RecoveryPointSelection  has  five  parameters (three required
                 and two optional). The values you specify determine which re-
                 covery  point is included in the restore test. You must indi-
                 cate with Algorithm if you want  the  latest  recovery  point
                 within  your  SelectionWindowDays or if you want a random re-
                 covery point, and you  must  indicate  through  IncludeVaults
                 from which vaults the recovery points can be chosen.

                 Algorithm  (required  ) Valid values: "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW "
                 or "RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW ".

                 Recovery point types (required ) Valid  values:  "SNAPSHOT  "
                 and/or  "CONTINUOUS ". Include SNAPSHOT to restore only snap-
                 shot recovery points; include CONTINUOUS to restore  continu-
                 ous  recovery points (point in time restore / PITR); use both
                 to restore either a snapshot or a continuous recovery  point.
                 The  recovery point will be determined by the value for Algo-
                 rithm .

                 IncludeVaults (required ).  You  must  include  one  or  more
                 backup vaults. Use the wildcard ["*"] or specific ARNs.

                 SelectionWindowDays  (optional ) Value must be an integer (in
                 days) from 1 to 365. If not included, the value  defaults  to
                 30 .

                 ExcludeVaults  (optional  ).  You  can choose to input one or
                 more specific backup vault ARNs to exclude those vaults' con-
                 tents from restore eligibility. Or, you can include a list of
                 selectors. If this parameter and its value are not  included,
                 it defaults to empty list.

              Algorithm -> (string)
                 Acceptable  values  include  "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW"  or "RAN-
                 DOM_WITHIN_WINDOW"

              ExcludeVaults -> (list)
                 Accepted values include specific ARNs or list  of  selectors.
                 Defaults to empty list if not listed.

                 (string)

              IncludeVaults -> (list)
                 Accepted values include wildcard ["*"] or by specific ARNs or
                 ARN                    wilcard                    replacement
                 ["arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-vault:asdf",
                 ...] ["arn:aws:backup:::backup-vault:asdf-
                 *
                 ", ...]

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 137)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                        (string)

              RecoveryPointTypes -> (list)
                 These are the types of recovery points.

                 Include SNAPSHOT to restore only  snapshot  recovery  points;
                 include  CONTINUOUS  to  restore  continuous  recovery points
                 (point in time restore / PITR); use both to restore either  a
                 snapshot  or  a continuous recovery point. The recovery point
                 will be determined by the value for Algorithm .

                 (string)

              SelectionWindowDays -> (integer)
                 Accepted values are integers from 1 to 365.

          RestoreTestingPlanName -> (string)
              The RestoreTestingPlanName is a unique string that is  the  name
              of  the  restore testing plan. This cannot be changed after cre-
              ation, and it must consist of only alphanumeric  characters  and
              underscores.

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A  CRON  expression in specified timezone when a restore testing
              plan is executed.

          ScheduleExpressionTimezone -> (string)
              Optional. This is the timezone in which the schedule  expression
              is set. By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You can mod-
              ify this to a specified timezone.

          StartWindowHours -> (integer)
              Defaults to 24 hours.

              A value in hours after a restore test is scheduled before a  job
              will be canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is
              optional. If this value is included, this parameter has a  maxi-
              mum value of 168 hours (one week).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
