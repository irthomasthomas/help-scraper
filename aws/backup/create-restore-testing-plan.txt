NAME
       create-restore-testing-plan -

DESCRIPTION

       this request is successful, finish the procedure with request CreateRe-
       storeTestingSelection.

       You  must  include the parameter RestoreTestingPlan. You may optionally
       include CreatorRequestId and Tags.

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          This is a unique string  that  identifies  the  request  and  allows
          failed  requests to be retriedwithout the risk of running the opera-
          tion twice. This parameter is optional. If used, this parameter must
          contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

       --restore-testing-plan (structure)
          A  restore testing plan must contain a unique RestoreTestingPlanName
          string you create and must contain a  ScheduleExpression  cron.  You
          may  optionally  include a StartWindowHours integer and a CreatorRe-
          questId string.

          The RestoreTestingPlanName is a unique string that is  the  name  of
          the restore testing plan. This cannot be changed after creation, and
          it must consist of only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

          RecoveryPointSelection -> (structure)

              Vaults (one or more). Optional: SelectionWindowDays ('30' if not
              specified); ExcludeVaults (list of selectors), defaults to empty
              list if not listed.

              mum value of 168 hours (one week).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time a restore testing plan was created, in Unix format
          and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  CreationTime  is
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
