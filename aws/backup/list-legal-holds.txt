LIST-LEGAL-HOLDS()                                          LIST-LEGAL-HOLDS()



NAME
       list-legal-holds -

DESCRIPTION
       This action returns metadata about active and previous legal holds.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-legal-holds  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: LegalHolds

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of  returned  resources.  For
          example,  if  a  request  is made to return maxResults number of re-
          sources, NextToken allows you to return  more  items  in  your  list
          starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

       LegalHolds -> (list)
          This is an array of returned legal holds, both active and previous.

          (structure)
              A  legal hold is an administrative tool that helps prevent back-
              ups from being deleted while under a hold. While the hold is  in
              place,  backups  under  a  hold  cannot be deleted and lifecycle
              policies that would alter the backup status (such as  transition
              to  cold storage) are delayed until the legal hold is removed. A
              backup can have more than one legal hold. Legal  holds  are  ap-
              plied  to  one  or more backups (also known as recovery points).
              These backups can be filtered by resource types and by  resource
              IDs.

              Title -> (string)
                 This is the title of a legal hold.

              Status -> (string)
                 This  is the status of the legal hold. Statuses can be ACTIVE
                 , CREATING , CANCELED , and CANCELING .

              Description -> (string)
                 This is the description of a legal hold.

              LegalHoldId -> (string)
                 ID of specific legal hold on one or more recovery points.

              LegalHoldArn -> (string)
                 This is an Amazon Resource Number (ARN) that uniquely identi-
                 fies       the       legal       hold;      for      example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
                 ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 This  is  the  time in number format when legal hold was cre-
                 ated.

              CancellationDate -> (timestamp)
                 This is the time in number format when legal  hold  was  can-
                 celled.
