OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --backup-plan (structure)
          Specifies  the  body of a backup plan. Includes a BackupPlanName and
          one or more sets of Rules .

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of re-
                 sources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A  display  name  for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup  vaults are identified by names that are unique to
                     the account used to create them and the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created. They consist of low-
                     ercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A CRON expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a
                     job will be canceled if it  doesn't  start  successfully.
                     This  value  is  optional.  If this value is included, it
                     must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

                     This  parameter  has  a  maximum  value  of   100   years
                     (52,560,000 minutes).

                     During the start window, the backup job status remains in
                     CREATED status until it has successfully begun  or  until
                     the  start  window  time has run out. If within the start
                     window time Backup receives an error that allows the  job
                     to  be  retried, Backup will automatically retry to begin
                     the job at least every 10 minutes until the  backup  suc-
                     cessfully  begins (the job status changes to RUNNING ) or
                     until the job status changes to  EXPIRED  (which  is  ex-
                     pected to occur when the start window time is over).

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in  minutes  after a backup job is successfully
                     started before it must be completed or it  will  be  can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The  lifecycle defines when a protected resource is tran-
                     sitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will
                     transition  and expire backups automatically according to
                     the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups transitioned to cold storage must  be  stored  in
                     cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the re-
                     tention setting must be 90 days greater than the  transi-
                     tion  to  cold after days setting. The transition to cold
                     after days setting cannot be changed after a  backup  has
                     been transitioned to cold.

                     Resource  types  that are able to be transitioned to cold
                     storage are listed in the  "Lifecycle  to  cold  storage"
                     section  of  the  Feature availability by resource table.
                     Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                     This parameter has a maximum value of 100  years  (36,500
                     days).

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery  point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days
                        plus MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     To help organize your resources, you can assign your  own
                     metadata  to the resources that you create. Each tag is a
                     key-value pair.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An array of CopyAction objects, which  contains  the  de-
                     tails of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Contains an array of Transition objects specifying
                            how long in days before a recovery  point  transi-
                            tions to cold storage or is deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored in cold storage for a minimum of  90  days.
                            Therefore,  on  the console, the retention setting
                            must be 90 days greater  than  the  transition  to
                            cold  after  days  setting. The transition to cold
                            after days  setting  cannot  be  changed  after  a
                            backup has been transitioned to cold.

                            Resource types that are able to be transitioned to
                            cold storage are listed in the "Lifecycle to  cold
                            storage"  section  of  the Feature availability by
                            resource table. Backup ignores this expression for
                            other resource types.

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies  the  number  of  days after creation
                               that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that  a  recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must be
                               greater than 90 days plus  MoveToColdStorageAf-
                               terDays .

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes Backup to create  continuous  backups  capable  of
                     point-in-time  restore  (PITR).  False (or not specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Specifies a list of BackupOptions for each resource type.  These
              settings  are only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Ser-
              vice (VSS) backup jobs.

              (structure)
                 A list of backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies an object containing resource type  and  backup
                     options.  The  only supported resource type is Amazon EC2
                     instances with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service  (VSS).

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to  enable  the  WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set   to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a  regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
