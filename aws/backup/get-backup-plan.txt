          --backup-plan-id <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --version-id (string)
          Unique,  randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that are
          at most 1,024 bytes long. Version IDs cannot be edited.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       BackupPlan -> (structure)
          Specifies the body of a backup plan. Includes a  BackupPlanName  and
          one or more sets of Rules .

          BackupPlanName -> (string)
              The display name of a backup plan. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanu-
              meric or '-_.' characters.

          Rules -> (list)
              An array of BackupRule objects, each of which specifies a sched-
              uled task that is used to back up a selection of resources.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a scheduled task used to back up a selection of re-
                 sources.

                 RuleName -> (string)
                     A display name for a backup rule. Must contain  1  to  50
                     alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

                 TargetBackupVaultName -> (string)
                     The name of a logical container where backups are stored.
                     Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique  to
                     the  account  used to create them and the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Region where they are created. They consist of low-
                     ercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

                 ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                     A cron expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates
                     a backup job. For more information about Amazon Web  Ser-
                     vices  cron  expressions,  see  Schedule  Expressions for
                     Rules in the Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide.  .  Two
                     examples of Amazon Web Services cron expressions are 15 *
                     ? * * * (take a backup every hour at 15 minutes past  the
                     hour)  and  0  12  * * ? * (take a backup every day at 12
                     noon UTC). For a table of examples, click  the  preceding
                     link and scroll down the page.

                 StartWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A  value  in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a
                     job will be canceled if it  doesn't  start  successfully.
                     This  value  is  optional.  If this value is included, it
                     must be at least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

                     During the start window, the backup job status remains in
                     CREATED  status  until it has successfully begun or until
                     the start window time has run out. If  within  the  start
                     window  time Backup receives an error that allows the job
                     to be retried, Backup will automatically retry  to  begin
                     the  job  at least every 10 minutes until the backup suc-
                     cessfully begins (the job status changes to RUNNING )  or
                     until  the  job  status  changes to EXPIRED (which is ex-
                     pected to occur when the start window time is over).

                 CompletionWindowMinutes -> (long)
                     A value in minutes after a  backup  job  is  successfully
                     started  before  it  must be completed or it will be can-
                     celed by Backup. This value is optional.

                 Lifecycle -> (structure)
                     The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  tran-
                     sitioned  to  cold  storage  and  when it expires. Backup
                     transitions and expires backups  automatically  according
                     to the lifecycle that you define.

                     Backups  transitioned  to  cold storage must be stored in
                     cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the re-
                     tention  setting must be 90 days greater than the transi-
                     tion to cold after days setting. The transition  to  cold
                     after  days  setting cannot be changed after a backup has
                     been transitioned to cold.

                     Resource types that are able to be transitioned  to  cold
                     storage  are  listed  in  the "Lifecycle to cold storage"
                     section of the Feature availability  by  resource  table.
                     Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery point is moved to cold storage.

                     DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                        Specifies the number of days after creation that a re-
                        covery  point is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days
                        plus MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

                 RecoveryPointTags -> (map)
                     An array of key-value pair strings that are  assigned  to
                     resources  that  are  associated  with this rule when re-
                     stored from backup.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     Uniquely identifies a rule that is used to  schedule  the
                     backup of a selection of resources.

                 CopyActions -> (list)
                     An  array  of  CopyAction objects, which contains the de-
                     tails of the copy operation.

                     (structure)
                        The details of the copy operation.

                        Lifecycle -> (structure)
                            Contains an array of Transition objects specifying
                            how  long  in days before a recovery point transi-
                            tions to cold storage or is deleted.

                            Backups  transitioned  to  cold  storage  must  be
                            stored  in  cold storage for a minimum of 90 days.
                            Therefore, on the console, the  retention  setting
                            must  be  90  days  greater than the transition to
                            cold after days setting. The  transition  to  cold
                            after  days  setting  cannot  be  changed  after a
                            backup has been transitioned to cold.

                            Resource types that are able to be transitioned to
                            cold  storage are listed in the "Lifecycle to cold
                            storage" section of the  Feature  availability  by
                            resource table. Backup ignores this expression for
                            other resource types.

                            MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies the number  of  days  after  creation
                               that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.

                            DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                               Specifies  the  number  of  days after creation
                               that a  recovery  point  is  deleted.  Must  be
                               greater  than 90 days plus MoveToColdStorageAf-
                               terDays .

                        DestinationBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                            An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  iden-
                            tifies the destination backup vault for the copied
                            backup.                For                example,
                            arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBack-
                            upVault .

                 EnableContinuousBackup -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups. True
                     causes  Backup  to  create  continuous backups capable of
                     point-in-time restore (PITR). False  (or  not  specified)
                     causes Backup to create snapshot backups.

                 ScheduleExpressionTimezone -> (string)
                     This  is the timezone in which the schedule expression is
                     set. By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You  can
                     modify this to a specified timezone.

          AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
              Contains a list of BackupOptions for each resource type.

              (structure)
                 A list of backup options for each resource type.

                 ResourceType -> (string)
                     Specifies  an  object containing resource type and backup
                     options. The only supported resource type is  Amazon  EC2
                     instances  with Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).
                     For a CloudFormation example, see the sample  CloudForma-
                     tion  template  to  enable Windows VSS in the Backup User
                     Guide .

                     Valid values: EC2 .

                 BackupOptions -> (map)
                     Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This
                     option is only available for Windows VSS backup jobs.

                     Valid values:

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to enable the WindowsVSS
                     backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                     Set  to  "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a   regular
                     backup. The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.

                     If  you  specify an invalid option, you get an InvalidPa-
                     rameterValueException exception.

                     For more  information  about  Windows  VSS  backups,  see
                     Creating a VSS-Enabled Windows Backup .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       BackupPlanId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       BackupPlanArn -> (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that uniquely identifies a backup
          plan;                          for                          example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
          .

       VersionId -> (string)
          Unique, randomly generated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings that  are
          at most 1,024 bytes long. Version IDs cannot be edited.

       CreatorRequestId -> (string)
          A  unique  string  that identifies the request and allows failed re-
          quests to be retried without  the  risk  of  running  the  operation
          twice.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date and time that a backup plan is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-

                 Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS backup
                 option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                 Set to "WindowsVSS":"disabled" to create  a  regular  backup.
                 The WindowsVSS option is not enabled by default.
