OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --backup-vault-account-id (string)
          The account ID of the specified backup vault.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  recovery point; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to create them and the Region where they are created.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault .

       SourceBackupVaultArn -> (string)

          vault  where  the resource was originally backed up in; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault . If
          the  recovery is restored to the same Amazon Web Services account or
          Region, this value will be null .

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of  the
          ARN depends on the resource type.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services  resource to save as a recovery
          point; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)  vol-
          ume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains  identifying  information  about the creation of a recovery
          point, including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId  ,  BackupPlanVer-
          sion , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs are unique, randomly generated, Unicode,  UTF-8  en-
              coded  strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be
              edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a  se-
              lection of resources.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       Status -> (string)
          A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.
              PARTIAL status indicates Backup could not  create  the  recovery
              point  before  the backup window closed. To increase your backup
              plan window using the API, see UpdateBackupPlan . You  can  also
              increase  your  backup plan window using the Console by choosing
              and editing your backup plan.

              EXPIRED status indicates that the recovery  point  has  exceeded
              its  retention  period, but Backup lacks permission or is other-
              wise unable to delete it.  To  manually  delete  these  recovery
              points,  see  Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the Clean up
              resources section of Getting started .

              STOPPED status occurs on a continuous backup where  a  user  has
              taken  some  action that causes the continuous backup to be dis-
              abled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning
              off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or
              disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup.
              For  recovery points of Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon Aurora
              resources, this status occurs when the  retention  period  of  a
              continuous backup rule is changed.

          To resolve STOPPED status, ensure that all requested permissions are
          in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these
          conditions  are met, the next instance of a backup rule running will
          result in a new continuous recovery point being created. The  recov-
          ery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.

          For SAP HANA on Amazon EC2 STOPPED status occurs due to user action,
          application misconfiguration, or backup failure. To ensure that  fu-
          ture  continuous backups succeed, refer to the recovery point status
          and check SAP HANA for details.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A status message explaining the status of the recovery point.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a recovery point is created, in  Unix  format
          and  Coordinated  Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time  that  a job to create a recovery point is com-
          pleted, in Unix format and Coordinated  Universal  Time  (UTC).  The
          value  of  CompletionDate  is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
          the  value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,   2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
          A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and MoveToColdStor-
          ageAt timestamps.

          MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to transition a  recovery  point
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The  lifecycle  defines when a protected resource is transitioned to
          cold storage and when it expires.  Backup  transitions  and  expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold
          storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the  retention  setting
          must  be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days set-
          ting. The transition to cold after days setting  cannot  be  changed
          after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the
          Feature availability by resource table. Backup ignores this  expres-
          sion for other resource types.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              The number of days after  creation  that  a  recovery  point  is
              deleted. This value must be at least 90 days after the number of
              days specified in MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

          OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources -> (boolean)
              If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported re-
              sources  to  archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your
              lifecycle settings.

       EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
          The server-side encryption key used to protect your backups; for ex-
          ample,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value that is returned as TRUE if the specified recovery
          point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point is not encrypted.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Specifies the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values  are
          WARM or COLD .

       LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The  value  of  LastRe-
          storeTime  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the value
          1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       ParentRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          This is an ARN that uniquely identifies a parent (composite)  recov-
          ery point; for example, arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       CompositeMemberIdentifier -> (string)
          The identifier of a resource  within  a  composite  group,  such  as
          nested  (child)  recovery  point  belonging  to a composite (parent)
          stack. The ID is transferred from the logical ID within a stack.

       IsParent -> (boolean)
          This returns the boolean value that a recovery  point  is  a  parent
          (composite) job.

       ResourceName -> (string)
          The name of the resource that belongs to the specified backup.

       VaultType -> (string)
