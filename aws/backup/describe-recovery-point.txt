OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Amazon Web Services  Region  where  they  are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
          point;  for  example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery  point;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The name of a logical container where  backups  are  stored.  Backup
          vaults  are  identified by names that are unique to the account used
          to create them and the Region where they are created.  They  consist
          of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An  ARN  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup  vault;  for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       SourceBackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  identifies  the  source
          vault  where  the resource was originally backed up in; for example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:BackupVault . If the re-
          covery  is  restored  to the same Amazon Web Services account or Re-
          gion, this value will be null .

       ResourceArn -> (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a saved resource. The format of  the
          ARN depends on the resource type.

       ResourceType -> (string)
          The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services  resource to save as a recovery
          point; for example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)  vol-
          ume or an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.

       CreatedBy -> (structure)
          Contains  identifying  information  about the creation of a recovery
          point, including the BackupPlanArn , BackupPlanId  ,  BackupPlanVer-
          sion , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used to create it.

          BackupPlanId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

          BackupPlanArn -> (string)
              An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup
              plan;                        for                        example,
              arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
              .

          BackupPlanVersion -> (string)
              Version IDs are unique, randomly generated, Unicode,  UTF-8  en-
              coded  strings that are at most 1,024 bytes long. They cannot be
              edited.

          BackupRuleId -> (string)
              Uniquely identifies a rule used to schedule the backup of a  se-
              lection of resources.

       IamRoleArn -> (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       Status -> (string)
          A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.
              PARTIAL status indicates Backup could not  create  the  recovery
              point  before  the backup window closed. To increase your backup
              plan window using the API, see UpdateBackupPlan . You  can  also
              increase  your  backup plan window using the Console by choosing
              and editing your backup plan.

              EXPIRED status indicates that the recovery  point  has  exceeded
              its  retention  period, but Backup lacks permission or is other-
              wise unable to delete it.  To  manually  delete  these  recovery
              points,  see  Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the Clean up
              resources section of Getting started .

              STOPPED status occurs on a continuous backup where  a  user  has
              taken  some  action that causes the continuous backup to be dis-
              abled. This can be caused by the removal of permissions, turning
              off versioning, turning off events being sent to EventBridge, or
              disabling the EventBridge rules that are put in place by Backup.

          To resolve STOPPED status, ensure that all requested permissions are
          in place and that versioning is enabled on the S3 bucket. Once these
          conditions are met, the next instance of a backup rule running  will
          result  in a new continuous recovery point being created. The recov-
          ery points with STOPPED status do not need to be deleted.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          A status message explaining the reason for the recovery point  dele-
          tion failure.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a recovery point is created, in Unix format
          and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  CreationDate  is
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CompletionDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a job to create  a  recovery  point  is  com-
          pleted,  in  Unix  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
          value of CompletionDate is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,
          the   value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
          12:11:30.087 AM.

       BackupSizeInBytes -> (long)
          The size, in bytes, of a backup.

       CalculatedLifecycle -> (structure)
          A CalculatedLifecycle object containing DeleteAt and MoveToColdStor-
          ageAt timestamps.

          MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
              A  timestamp  that specifies when to transition a recovery point
              to cold storage.

          DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that specifies when to delete a recovery point.

       Lifecycle -> (structure)
          The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  transitioned  to
          cold  storage  and  when  it expires. Backup transitions and expires
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold
          storage  for  a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting
          must be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days  set-
          ting.  The  transition  to cold after days setting cannot be changed
          after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage  are
          listed  in  the  "Lifecycle  to cold storage" section of the Feature
          availability by resource table. Backup ignores this  expression  for
          other resource types.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
          The server-side encryption key used to protect your backups; for ex-
          ample,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value that is returned as TRUE if the specified recovery
          point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point is not encrypted.

       StorageClass -> (string)
          Specifies the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values  are
          WARM or COLD .

       LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time that a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The  value  of  LastRe-
          storeTime  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the value
          1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       ParentRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
          This is an ARN that uniquely identifies a parent (composite)  recov-
          ery point; for example, arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       CompositeMemberIdentifier -> (string)
          This is the identifier of a resource within a composite group,  such
          as  nested  (child) recovery point belonging to a composite (parent)
          stack. The ID is transferred from the logical ID within a stack.

       IsParent -> (boolean)
          This returns the boolean value that a recovery  point  is  a  parent
          (composite) job.
