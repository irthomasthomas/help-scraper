NAME
       list-backup-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of existing backup jobs for an authenticated account for
       the last 30 days. For a longer period of  time,  consider  using  these
       monitoring tools .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-backup-jobs  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: BackupJobs

       --by-backup-vault-name (string)
          Returns only backup jobs that will be stored in the specified backup
          vault. Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to  the
          account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where
          they are created. They consist of lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and
          hyphens.

          date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only backup jobs that were created after the specified date.

       --by-resource-type (string)

          o Storage Gateway for Storage Gateway

          o S3 for Amazon S3

          o VirtualMachine for virtual machines

       --by-account-id (string)
          The account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only backup jobs asso-
          ciated with the specified account ID.

          If  used from an Organizations management account, passing * returns
          all jobs across the organization.

       --by-complete-after (timestamp)
          Returns only backup jobs completed after a date  expressed  in  Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-complete-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only  backup jobs completed before a date expressed in Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-parent-job-id (string)
          This is a filter to list child (nested) jobs based on parent job ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 names without  those  strings  lack  permissions  to  perform
                 backup jobs.

              CreatedBy -> (structure)
                 Contains  identifying  information  about  the  creation of a
                 backup job, including  the  BackupPlanArn  ,  BackupPlanId  ,
                 BackupPlanVersion  , and BackupRuleId of the backup plan used
                 to create it.

              StartBy -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time in Unix format and  Coordinated  Universal
                 Time  (UTC)  when  a  backup job must be started before it is
                 canceled. The value is calculated by adding the start  window
                 to  the scheduled time. So if the scheduled time were 6:00 PM
                 and the start window is 2 hours, the StartBy  time  would  be
                 8:00  PM on the date specified. The value of StartBy is accu-
                 rate to milliseconds. For example, the  value  1516925490.087
                 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be backed up; for
                 example, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or
                 an  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.
                 For Windows Volume Shadow Copy  Service  (VSS)  backups,  the
                 only supported resource type is Amazon EC2.

              BytesTransferred -> (long)
                 The  size  in bytes transferred to a backup vault at the time
                 that the job status was queried.

              BackupOptions -> (map)
                 Specifies the backup option for a selected resource. This op-
                 tion is only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service
                 (VSS) backup jobs.

                 Valid values: Set to  "WindowsVSS":"enabled"  to  enable  the
                 WindowsVSS backup option and create a Windows VSS backup. Set
                 to "WindowsVSS":"disabled" to create a regular backup. If you
                 specify  an invalid option, you get an InvalidParameterValue-
                 Exception exception.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ParentJobId -> (string)
                 This uniquely identifies a request to Backup to back up a re-
                 source. The return will be the parent (composite) job ID.

              IsParent -> (boolean)
                 This  is a boolean value indicating this is a parent (compos-
                 ite) backup job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.
