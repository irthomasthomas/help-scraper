OPTIONS
       --by-report-plan-name (string)
          Returns only report jobs with the specified report plan name.

       --by-creation-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only report jobs that were created before the date and time
          specified in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).  For
          example,  the  value  1516925490 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
          12:11:30 AM.

       --by-creation-after (timestamp)
          Returns only report jobs that were created after the date  and  time
          specified  in  Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For
          example, the value 1516925490 represents Friday,  January  26,  2018
          12:11:30 AM.

       --by-status (string)
          Returns  only report jobs that are in the specified status. The sta-
          tuses are:
              CREATED | RUNNING | COMPLETED | FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of desired results from 1 to 1000. Optional. If  unspeci-
          fied, the query will return 1 MB of data.

       --next-token (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       ReportJobs -> (list)
          Details about your report jobs in JSON format.

          (structure)
              Contains  detailed  information about a report job. A report job
              compiles a report based on a report plan  and  publishes  it  to
              Amazon S3.

              ReportJobId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  a report job. A unique, randomly gener-
                 ated, Unicode, UTF-8 encoded string that  is  at  most  1,024
                 bytes long. Report job IDs cannot be edited.

              ReportPlanArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a re-
                 source. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              ReportTemplate -> (string)
                 Identifies the report template for the  report.  Reports  are
                 built using a report template. The report templates are:
                     RESOURCE_COMPLIANCE_REPORT  | CONTROL_COMPLIANCE_REPORT |
                     BACKUP_JOB_REPORT | COPY_JOB_REPORT | RESTORE_JOB_REPORT

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that a report job is created, in Unix  for-
                 mat  and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Cre-
                 ationTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that a report job  is  completed,  in  Unix
                 format  and  Coordinated  Universal  Time (UTC). The value of
                 CompletionTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example,  the
                 value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26, 2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of a report job. The statuses are:
                     CREATED | RUNNING | COMPLETED | FAILED

                     COMPLETED means that the report is available for your re-
                     view  at  your  designated  destination. If the status is
                     FAILED , review the StatusMessage for the reason.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A message explaining the status of the report job.

              ReportDestination -> (structure)
                 The S3 bucket name and S3 keys for the destination where  the
                 report job publishes the report.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     The  unique  name  of  the Amazon S3 bucket that receives
                     your reports.

                     The object key that uniquely identifies your  reports  in
                     your S3 bucket.

                     (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          An identifier that was returned from the previous call to this oper-
          ation, which can be used to return the next  set  of  items  in  the
          list.
