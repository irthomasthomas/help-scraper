OPTIONS
       --framework-name (string)
          The unique name of a framework.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       FrameworkName -> (string)
          The unique name of a framework.

       FrameworkArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  a  resource.
          The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

       FrameworkDescription -> (string)
          An optional description of the framework.

       FrameworkControls -> (list)
          A  list  of the controls that make up the framework. Each control in
          the list has a name, input parameters, and scope.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about all of  the  controls  of  a
              framework. Each framework must contain at least one control.

              ControlName -> (string)
                 The name of a control. This name is between 1 and 256 charac-
                 ters.

              ControlInputParameters -> (list)
                 A list of ParameterName and ParameterValue pairs.

                 (structure)
                     A list of parameters for a control. A  control  can  have
                     zero,  one,  or  more than one parameter. An example of a
                     control with two parameters is: "backup plan frequency is
                     at  least  daily  and  the retention period is at least 1
                     year ". The first parameter is daily . The second parame-
                     ter is 1 year .

                     ParameterName -> (string)
                        The  name  of a parameter, for example, BackupPlanFre-
                        quency .

                     ParameterValue -> (string)
                        The value of parameter, for example, hourly .

              ControlScope -> (structure)
                 The scope of a control. The control scope  defines  what  the
                 control  will evaluate. Three examples of control scopes are:
                 a specific backup plan, all backup plans with a specific tag,
                 or all backup plans. For more information, see ` ControlScope
                 . <aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_ControlScope.html>`__

                 ComplianceResourceIds -> (list)
                     The ID of the only Amazon Web Services resource that  you
                     want your control scope to contain.

                     (string)

                 ComplianceResourceTypes -> (list)
                     Describes  whether the control scope includes one or more
                     types of resources, such as EFS or RDS .

                     (string)

                 Tags -> (map)
                     The tag key-value pair applied to those Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices  resources  that  you want to trigger an evaluation
                     for a rule. A maximum of one key-value pair can  be  pro-
                     vided.  The  tag  value  is optional, but it cannot be an
                     empty  string.  The  structure  to  assign  a   tag   is:
                     [{"Key":"string","Value":"string"}] .

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time that a framework is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationTime is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       DeploymentStatus -> (string)
          The deployment status of a framework. The statuses are:
              CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS |  DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  |
              COMPLETED | FAILED

       FrameworkStatus -> (string)
          A framework consists of one or more controls. Each control governs a
          resource, such as backup plans, backup selections, backup vaults, or
          recovery  points.  You  can also turn Config recording on or off for
          each resource. The statuses are:

          o ACTIVE when recording is turned on for all resources  governed  by
            the framework.

          o PARTIALLY_ACTIVE when recording is turned off for at least one re-
            source governed by the framework.

          o INACTIVE when recording is turned off for all  resources  governed
            by the framework.

          o UNAVAILABLE  when Backup is unable to validate recording status at
            this time.

       IdempotencyToken -> (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical  calls  to DescribeFrameworkOutput . Retrying a
          successful request with the same idempotency token results in a suc-
          cess message with no action taken.
