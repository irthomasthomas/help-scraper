CREATE-LEGAL-HOLD()                                        CREATE-LEGAL-HOLD()



NAME
       create-legal-hold -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  legal  hold on a recovery point (backup). A legal hold is a
       restraint on altering or deleting a backup  until  an  authorized  user
       cancels  the legal hold. Any actions to delete or disassociate a recov-
       ery point will fail with an error if one or more active legal holds are
       on the recovery point.

OPTIONS
       --title (string)

       --description (string)
          The description of the legal hold.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          This  is  a user-chosen string used to distinguish between otherwise
          identical calls. Retrying a successful request with the same idempo-
          tency token results in a success message with no action taken.

       --recovery-point-selection (structure)
          The criteria to assign a set of resources, such as resource types or
          backup vaults.

          VaultNames -> (list)
              These are the names of the vaults in which the selected recovery
              points are contained.

              (string)

          ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)
              These  are the resources included in the resource selection (in-
              cluding type of resources and vaults).

              (string)

          DateRange -> (structure)
              This is a resource filter containing FromDate: DateTime and  To-
              Date: DateTime. Both values are required. Future DateTime values
              are not permitted.

              The date and time are in Unix format and  Coordinated  Universal
              Time  (UTC),  and  it is accurate to milliseconds ((milliseconds
              are optional). For example, the value 1516925490.087  represents
              Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              FromDate -> (timestamp)
                 This value is the beginning date, inclusive.

                 sal Time (UTC), and it is accurate to milliseconds (millisec-
                 onds are optional).

              ToDate -> (timestamp)
                 This value is the end date, inclusive.

                 sal Time (UTC), and it is accurate to milliseconds (millisec-
                 onds are optional).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VaultNames=string,string,ResourceIdentifiers=string,string,DateRange={FromDate=timestamp,ToDate=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VaultNames": ["string", ...],
            "ResourceIdentifiers": ["string", ...],
            "DateRange": {
              "FromDate": timestamp,
              "ToDate": timestamp
            }
          }

       --tags (map)
          Optional  tags  to include. A tag is a key-value pair you can use to
          manage, filter, and search for your  resources.  Allowed  characters
          include  UTF-8  letters,  numbers, spaces, and the following charac-
          ters: + - = . _ : /.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
