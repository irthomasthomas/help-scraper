LIST-COPY-JOBS()                                              LIST-COPY-JOBS()



NAME
       list-copy-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata about your copy jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-copy-jobs  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CopyJobs

       --by-destination-vault-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  that uniquely identifies a source
          backup     vault      to      copy      from;      for      example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       --by-account-id (string)
          The account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only copy jobs associ-
          ated with the specified account ID.

       --by-complete-before (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs completed before a  date  expressed  in  Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-complete-after (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs completed after a date expressed in Unix for-
          mat and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
