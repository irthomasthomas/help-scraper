NAME
       list-protected-resources-by-backup-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       This request lists the protected resources corresponding to each backup
       vault.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-protected-resources-by-backup-vault is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Results

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  list of protected resources by backup vault within the vault(s)
          you specify by name.

       --backup-vault-account-id (string)
          The list of protected resources by backup vault within the  vault(s)
          you specify by account ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          These  are  the  results  returned  for  the  request  ListProtecte-
          dResourcesByBackupVault.

          (structure)
              A  structure  that  contains  information  about a backed-up re-
              source.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  re-
                 source. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type  of  Amazon  Web Services resource; for example, an
                 Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or  an  Amazon
                 Relational  Database  Service (Amazon RDS) database. For Win-
                 dows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backups, the only  sup-
                 ported resource type is Amazon EC2.

              LastBackupTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a resource was last backed up, in Unix for-
                 mat and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Last-
                 BackupTime  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the
                 value 1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 The non-unique name of the resource that belongs to the spec-
                 ified backup.

              LastBackupVaultArn -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the backup vault that  con-
                 tains the most recent backup recovery point.

              LastRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  (Amazon  Resource Name) of the most recent recovery
                 point.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return MaxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.
