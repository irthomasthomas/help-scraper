CREATE-RESTORE-TESTING-SELECTION()          CREATE-RESTORE-TESTING-SELECTION()



NAME
       create-restore-testing-selection -

DESCRIPTION
       This request can be sent after CreateRestoreTestingPlan request returns
       successfully. This is the second part of creating  a  resource  testing
       plan, and it must be completed sequentially.

       This  consists of RestoreTestingSelectionName , ProtectedResourceType ,
       and one of the following:

       o ProtectedResourceArns

       o ProtectedResourceConditions

       Each protected resource type can have one single value.

       A restore testing selection can include a wildcard value ("*") for Pro-
       tectedResourceArns  along  with  ProtectedResourceConditions . Alterna-
       tively, you can include up to 30 specific protected  resource  ARNs  in
       ProtectedResourceArns .

       Cannot  select  by both protected resource types AND specific ARNs. Re-
       quest will fail if both are included.

OPTIONS
       --creator-request-id (string)
          This is an optional unique string that identifies  the  request  and
          allows failed requests to be retried without the risk of running the
          operation twice. If used, this parameter must contain 1  to  50  al-
          phanumeric or '-_.' characters.

       --restore-testing-plan-name (string)
          Input  the  restore testing plan name that was returned from the re-
          lated CreateRestoreTestingPlan request.

       --restore-testing-selection (structure)
          This consists of RestoreTestingSelectionName , ProtectedResourceType
          , and one of the following:

          o ProtectedResourceArns

          o ProtectedResourceConditions

          Each protected resource type can have one single value.

          A  restore  testing selection can include a wildcard value ("*") for
          ProtectedResourceArns along with ProtectedResourceConditions  .  Al-
          ternatively,  you  can  include up to 30 specific protected resource
          ARNs in ProtectedResourceArns .

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup  uses
              to     create     the     target    resource;    for    example:
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          ProtectedResourceArns -> (list)

              by a wildcard: ProtectedResourceArns: ["*"] , but not both.

              (string)

          ProtectedResourceConditions -> (structure)
              If you have included the wildcard in ProtectedResourceArns,  you

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
