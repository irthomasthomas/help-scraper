OPTIONS
       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An ARN that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery  point;  for  example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --metadata (map)
          A set of metadata key-value pairs. Contains information, such  as  a
          resource name, required to restore a recovery point.

          You  can  get configuration metadata about a resource at the time it
          was backed up by calling GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata .  However,
          values in addition to those provided by GetRecoveryPointRestoreMeta-
          data might be required to restore a resource. For example, you might
          need to provide a new resource name if the original already exists.

          You  need  to specify specific metadata to restore an Amazon Elastic
          File System (Amazon EFS) instance:

          o file-system-id : The ID of the Amazon  EFS  file  system  that  is
            backed up by Backup. Returned in GetRecoveryPointRestoreMetadata .

          o Encrypted : A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that the file
            system is encrypted. If KmsKeyId is specified, Encrypted  must  be
            set to true .

          o KmsKeyId  : Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is used
            to encrypt the restored file system. You can specify  a  key  from
            another  Amazon Web Services account provided that key it is prop-
            erly shared with your account via Amazon Web Services KMS.

          o PerformanceMode : Specifies the throughput mode of the  file  sys-
            tem.

          o CreationToken  : A user-supplied value that ensures the uniqueness
            (idempotency) of the request.

          o newFileSystem : A Boolean value that, if true, specifies that  the
            recovery point is restored to a new Amazon EFS file system.

          o ItemsToRestore : An array of one to five strings where each string
            is a file path. Use ItemsToRestore to restore  specific  files  or
            directories  rather than the entire file system. This parameter is
            optional. For example, "itemsToRestore":"[\"/my.test\"]" .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup  uses  to
          create     the     target     recovery     point;    for    example,
          arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise identical calls to StartRestoreJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --resource-type (string)
          Starts  a  job  to restore a recovery point for one of the following
          resources:

          o Aurora for Amazon Aurora

          o DocumentDB for Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)

          o DynamoDB for Amazon DynamoDB

          o EBS for Amazon Elastic Block Store

          o EC2 for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

          o EFS for Amazon Elastic File System

          o FSx for Amazon FSx

          o Neptune for Amazon Neptune

          o RDS for Amazon Relational Database Service

          o Storage Gateway for Storage Gateway

          o S3 for Amazon S3

          o VirtualMachine for virtual machines

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RestoreJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies the job that restores a recovery point.
