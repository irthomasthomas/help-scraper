LIST-RESTORE-JOBS()                                        LIST-RESTORE-JOBS()



NAME
       list-restore-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  jobs that Backup initiated to restore a saved re-
       source, including details about the recovery process.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-restore-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: RestoreJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-restore-jobs
          [--by-account-id <value>]
          [--by-created-before <value>]
          [--by-created-after <value>]
          [--by-status <value>]
          [--by-complete-before <value>]
          [--by-complete-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --by-account-id (string)
          The  account ID to list the jobs from. Returns only restore jobs as-
          sociated with the specified account ID.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns only restore jobs that were  created  before  the  specified
          date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns  only  restore  jobs  that  were created after the specified
          date.

       --by-status (string)
          Returns only restore jobs associated with the specified job status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o RUNNING

          o COMPLETED

          o ABORTED

          o FAILED

       --by-complete-before (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs completed before a  date  expressed  in  Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-complete-after (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs completed after a date expressed in Unix for-
          mat and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018

              ExpectedCompletionTimeMinutes -> (long)
                 The amount of time in minutes that a job restoring a recovery
                 point is expected to take.

              CreatedResourceArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  re-
                 source. The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of the listed restore jobs; for example, an
                 Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or  an  Amazon
                 Relational  Database  Service (Amazon RDS) database. For Win-
                 dows Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) backups, the only  sup-
                 ported resource type is Amazon EC2.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
