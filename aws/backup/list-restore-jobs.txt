LIST-RESTORE-JOBS()                                        LIST-RESTORE-JOBS()



NAME
       list-restore-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of  jobs that Backup initiated to restore a saved re-
       source, including details about the recovery process.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-restore-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: RestoreJobs

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only  restore  jobs  that were created before the specified
          date.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only restore jobs that  were  created  after  the  specified
          date.

       --by-status (string)
          Returns only restore jobs associated with the specified job status.

          Possible values:

          o PENDING

          o RUNNING

          o COMPLETED

          o ABORTED

          o FAILED

       --by-complete-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only  copy  jobs  completed before a date expressed in Unix
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-complete-after (timestamp)
          Returns only copy jobs completed after a date expressed in Unix for-
          mat and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

       --by-restore-testing-plan-arn (string)
          This  returns only restore testing jobs that match the specified re-
          source Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
