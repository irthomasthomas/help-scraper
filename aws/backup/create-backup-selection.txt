OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          The ID of the backup plan.

       --backup-selection (structure)
          The body of a request to assign a set of resources to a backup plan.

          SelectionName -> (string)
              The display name of a resource selection document. Must  contain
              1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when
              backing    up    the    target    resource;     for     example,
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          Resources -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to assign to a
              backup plan. The maximum number of ARNs  is  500  without  wild-
              cards, or 30 ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider
              a different resource selection strategy, such as  assigning  all
              resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection
              using tags.

              If you specify multiple ARNs, the resources much  match  any  of
              the ARNs (OR logic).

              (string)

          ListOfTags -> (list)
              The  conditions  that  you  define  to  assign resources to your
              backup plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": {  "Condi-
              tionKey": "backup", "ConditionValue": "daily"} .
                 ListOfTags  supports  only StringEquals . Condition operators
                 are case sensitive.

              If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match any
              of the conditions (OR logic).

              (structure)
                 Contains  an  array  of  triplets made up of a condition type
                 (such as StringEquals ), a key, and a value. Used  to  filter
                 resources  using their tags and assign them to a backup plan.
                 Case sensitive.

                 ConditionType -> (string)
                     An operation applied to a key-value pair used  to  assign
                     resources  to  your  backup plan. Condition only supports
                     StringEquals . For more flexible assignment options,  in-
                     cluding  StringLike  and the ability to exclude resources
                     from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an "s" on the
                     end)        for        your       `       BackupSelection
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html`__
                     .

                 ConditionKey -> (string)
                     The  key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment: Accounting , Department is the key.

                 ConditionValue -> (string)
                     The value in a key-value pair. For example,  in  the  tag
                     Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

          NotResources -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs) of the resources to exclude
              from a backup plan. The maximum number of ARNs  is  500  without
              wildcards, or 30 ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you  need to exclude many resources from a backup plan, con-
              sider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning
              only  one  or a few resource types or refining your resource se-
              lection using tags.

              (string)

          Conditions -> (structure)
              The conditions that you  define  to  assign  resources  to  your
              backup  plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals": { "Condi-
              tionKey": "aws:ResourceTag/backup", "ConditionValue": "daily"  }
              .
                 Conditions  supports  StringEquals , StringLike , StringNotE-
                 quals , and StringNotLike . Condition operators are case sen-
                 sitive.

              If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match all
              conditions (AND logic).

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged with the same value. Also called
                 "exact matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     Include  the prefix aws:ResourceTag in your tags. For ex-
                     ample, "aws:ResourceTag/TagKey1": "Value1" .

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag
                        Department: Accounting , Department is the key.

                     ConditionValue -> (string)
                        The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag
                        Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

              StringNotEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged that do not have the same value.
                 Also called "negated matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes information about  tags  you  define  to  assign

                     ample, "aws:ResourceTag/TagKey1": "Value1" .

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag

              StringLike -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources for matching  tag
                 values  with  the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere in
                 the string. For example, "prod*" or  "rod"  matches  the  tag
                 value "production".

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

              StringNotLike -> (list)
                 Filters  the values of your tagged resources for non-matching
                 tag values with the use of a wildcard character (*)  anywhere

              ]
            }
          }

       --creator-request-id (string)
          A  unique  string  that identifies the request and allows failed re-
          quests to be retried without  the  risk  of  running  the  operation
          twice. This parameter is optional.

          If  used,  this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.'
          characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SelectionId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies the body of a request to assign  a  set  of  re-
          sources to a backup plan.

       BackupPlanId -> (string)
          The ID of the backup plan.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date and time a backup selection is created, in Unix format and
