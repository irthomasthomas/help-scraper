OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --selection-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies the body of a request to assign  a  set  of  re-
          sources to a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BackupSelection -> (structure)
          Specifies the body of a request to assign a set of  resources  to  a
          backup plan.

          SelectionName -> (string)
              The  display name of a resource selection document. Must contain
              1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that Backup uses  to  authenticate  when
              backing     up     the    target    resource;    for    example,
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          Resources -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to  assign  to  a  backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If you need to assign many resources to a backup plan,  consider
              a  different  resource selection strategy, such as assigning all
              resources of a resource type or refining your resource selection
              using tags.

              (string)

          ListOfTags -> (list)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup plans using tags. For example, "StringEquals":  {  "Key":
              "aws:ResourceTag/CreatedByCryo",  "Value": "true" }, . Condition
              operators are case sensitive.
                 ListOfTags differs from Conditions as follows:

              o When you specify more than one condition, you assign  all  re-
                sources that match AT LEAST ONE condition (using OR logic).

              o ListOfTags  only  supports  StringEquals . Conditions supports
                StringEquals , StringLike , StringNotEquals ,  and  StringNot-
                Like .

              (structure)
                 Contains  an  array  of  triplets made up of a condition type
                 (such as StringEquals ), a key, and a value. Used  to  filter
                 resources  using their tags and assign them to a backup plan.
                 Case sensitive.

                 ConditionType -> (string)
                     An operation applied to a key-value pair used  to  assign
                     resources  to  your  backup plan. Condition only supports
                     StringEquals . For more flexible assignment options,  in-
                     cluding  StringLike  and the ability to exclude resources
                     from your backup plan, use Conditions (with an "s" on the
                     end)        for        your       `       BackupSelection
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html`__
                     .

                 ConditionKey -> (string)
                     The  key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment: Accounting , Department is the key.

                 ConditionValue -> (string)
                     The value in a key-value pair. For example,  in  the  tag
                     Department: Accounting , Accounting is the value.

          NotResources -> (list)
              A  list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to exclude from a backup
              plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
              ARNs with wildcards.

              If  you  need to exclude many resources from a backup plan, con-
              sider a different resource selection strategy, such as assigning
              only  one  or a few resource types or refining your resource se-
              lection using tags.

              (string)

          Conditions -> (structure)
              A list of conditions that you define to assign resources to your
              backup  plans  using tags. For example, "StringEquals": { "Key":
              "aws:ResourceTag/CreatedByCryo", "Value": "true" }, .  Condition
              operators are case sensitive.
                 Conditions differs from ListOfTags as follows:

              o When  you specify more than one condition, you only assign the
                resources that match ALL conditions (using AND logic).

              o Conditions supports StringEquals ,  StringLike  ,  StringNotE-
                quals  , and StringNotLike . ListOfTags only supports StringE-
                quals .

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters the values of your tagged resources  for  only  those
                 resources  that  you  tagged with the same value. Also called

              StringNotEquals -> (list)
                 Filters  the  values  of your tagged resources for only those
                 resources that you tagged that do not have  the  same  value.
                 Also called "negated matching."

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign

                 values  with  the use of a wildcard character (*) anywhere in
                 the string. For example, "prod*" or  "rod"  matches  the  tag
                 value "production".

                 (structure)
                     Includes  information  about  tags  you  define to assign
                     tagged resources to a backup plan.

                     ConditionKey -> (string)
                        The key in a key-value pair. For example, in  the  tag
