          types.

          ple, an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an  Amazon

       --aggregation-period (string)
          The period for the returned results.

          o ONE_DAY - The daily job count for the prior 14 days.

          o SEVEN_DAYS - The aggregated job count for the prior 7 days.

          starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
