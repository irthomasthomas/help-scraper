OPTIONS
       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point to use for the copy
          job;   for   example,   arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45.

       --source-backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical source container where backups are stored.
          Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to the account
          used  to  create  them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they
          are created. They consist of lowercase  letters,  numbers,  and  hy-
          phens.

       --destination-backup-vault-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a destination
          backup      vault      to      copy      to;      for       example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          Specifies  the  IAM role ARN used to copy the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical  calls  to StartCopyJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --lifecycle (structure)
          Contains  an array of Transition objects specifying how long in days
          before a recovery point transitions to cold storage or is deleted.

          Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold  storage
          for  a  minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the retention
          setting must be 90 days greater than the transition  to  cold  after
          days  setting.  The  transition to cold after days setting cannot be
          changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage  are
          listed  in  the  "Lifecycle  to cold storage" section of the Feature
          availability by resource table. Backup ignores this  expression  for
          other resource types.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

          OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources -> (boolean)
              Optional Boolean. If this is true, this  setting  will  instruct
              your  backup  plan  to transition supported resources to archive
              (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle settings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long,OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long,
            "OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       CopyJobId -> (string)
          Uniquely identifies a copy job.

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a copy job is created, in Unix format and Co-
          ordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate  is  accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-

       IsParent -> (boolean)
          This is a returned boolean value indicating this is a  parent  (com-
