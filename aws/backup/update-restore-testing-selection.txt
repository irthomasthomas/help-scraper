OPTIONS
       --restore-testing-plan-name (string)
          The restore testing plan name is required to  update  the  indicated
          testing plan.

       --restore-testing-selection (structure)
          To  update  your  restore testing selection, you can use either pro-
          tected resource ARNs or conditions, but not both. That is,  if  your
          selection  has ProtectedResourceArns , requesting an update with the
          parameter ProtectedResourceConditions will be unsuccessful.

          IamRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup  uses
              to     create     the     target    resource;    for    example:
              arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

          ProtectedResourceArns -> (list)
              You can include a list  of  specific  ARNs,  such  as  Protecte-
              dResourceArns: ["arn:aws:...", "arn:aws:..."] or you can include
              a wildcard: ProtectedResourceArns: ["*"] , but not both.

              (string)

          ProtectedResourceConditions -> (structure)
              The conditions that you define for  resources  in  your  restore
              testing plan using tags.

              StringEquals -> (list)
                 Filters  the  values  of your tagged resources for only those
                 resources that you tagged with the same  value.  Also  called

                 (structure)

                     Key -> (string)

              equivalent of seven days).

       JSON Syntax:

                }

              ...},
            "ValidationWindowHours": integer
          }

       --restore-testing-selection-name (string)
          The  required  restore testing selection name of the restore testing
          selection you wish to update.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
