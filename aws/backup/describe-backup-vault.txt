OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       BackupVaultName -> (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them and the Region where they are created. They consist
          of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       BackupVaultArn -> (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a  backup
          vault;                          for                         example,
          arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:vault:aBackupVault .

       EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
          The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups;
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
          .

       CreationDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that a backup vault is created, in Unix format and
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of CreationDate is accu-
          rate  to  milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
          sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

       CreatorRequestId -> (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and  allows  failed  re-
          quests  to  be  retried  without  the  risk of running the operation
          twice.

       NumberOfRecoveryPoints -> (long)
          The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.

       Locked -> (boolean)
          A Boolean that indicates whether Backup Vault Lock is currently pro-
          tecting  the  backup vault. True means that Vault Lock causes delete
          or update operations on the recovery points stored in the  vault  to
          fail.

       MinRetentionDays -> (long)
          The  Backup  Vault Lock setting that specifies the minimum retention
          period that the vault retains its recovery points. If this parameter
          is  not  specified,  Vault Lock does not enforce a minimum retention
          period.

          If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a  life-
          cycle  policy  with  a  retention period equal to or longer than the
          minimum retention period. If the job's retention period  is  shorter
          than  that minimum retention period, then the vault fails the backup
          or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or
          use  a  different vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault
          prior to Vault Lock are not affected.

       MaxRetentionDays -> (long)
          The Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the  maximum  retention
          period that the vault retains its recovery points. If this parameter
          is not specified, Vault Lock does not enforce  a  maximum  retention
          period  on  the  recovery  points  in the vault (allowing indefinite
          storage).

          If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a  life-
          cycle  policy  with  a retention period equal to or shorter than the
          maximum retention period. If the job's retention  period  is  longer
          than  that maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup
          or copy job, and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or
          use  a  different vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault
          prior to Vault Lock are not affected.

       LockDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when Backup Vault  Lock  configuration  cannot  be
          changed or deleted.

          If  you  applied  Vault Lock to your vault without specifying a lock
          date, you can change any of your  Vault  Lock  settings,  or  delete
          Vault Lock from the vault entirely, at any time.

          This  value is in Unix format, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and
          accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 rep-
          resents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.
