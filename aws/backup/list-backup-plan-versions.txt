LIST-BACKUP-PLAN-VERSIONS()                        LIST-BACKUP-PLAN-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-backup-plan-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  version  metadata  of  your backup plans, including Amazon Re-
       source Names (ARNs), backup plan IDs, creation and deletion dates, plan
       names, and version IDs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-backup-plan-versions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: BackupPlanVersionsList

SYNOPSIS
            list-backup-plan-versions
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The next item following a partial list of returned items. For  exam-
          ple,  if  a  request  is  made to return maxResults number of items,
          NextToken allows you to return more items in your list  starting  at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       BackupPlanVersionsList -> (list)
          An array of version list items containing metadata about your backup
          plans.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a backup plan.

              BackupPlanArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  that  uniquely  identifies  a
                 backup             plan;             for             example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:plan:8F81F553-3A74-4A3F-B93D-B3360DC80C50
                 .

              BackupPlanId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time a resource backup plan is created, in Unix
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).  The  value  of
                 CreationDate  is  accurate  to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value 1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018

              DeletionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time a backup plan is deleted, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Deletion-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              VersionId -> (string)
                 Unique,  randomly  generated,  Unicode, UTF-8 encoded strings
                 that are at most 1,024 bytes  long.  Version  IDs  cannot  be
                 edited.

              BackupPlanName -> (string)

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
                 requests to be retried without the risk of running the opera-
                 tion twice. This parameter is optional.

                 If  used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or

              LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last time a job to back up resources was  run  with  this
                 rule. A date and time, in Unix format and Coordinated Univer-
                 sal Time (UTC). The value of LastExecutionDate is accurate to
                 milliseconds.  For  example,  the value 1516925490.087 repre-
                 sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              AdvancedBackupSettings -> (list)
                 Contains a list of BackupOptions for a resource type.

                 (structure)
                     A list of backup options for each resource type.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies  an  object  containing  resource  type  and
                        backup  options.  The  only supported resource type is
                        Amazon EC2 instances with Windows Volume  Shadow  Copy
                        Service  (VSS).  For a CloudFormation example, see the
                        sample CloudFormation template to enable  Windows  VSS
                        in the Backup User Guide .

                        Valid values: EC2 .

                     BackupOptions -> (map)
                        Specifies  the  backup option for a selected resource.
                        This option is only available for Windows  VSS  backup
                        jobs.

                        Valid values:

                        Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS
                        backup option and create a Windows VSS backup.

                        Set to "WindowsVSS":"disabled"  to  create  a  regular
                        backup.  The  WindowsVSS  option is not enabled by de-
                        fault.

                        If you specify an invalid option, you get an  Invalid-
                        ParameterValueException exception.

                        For  more  information  about Windows VSS backups, see
                        Creating a VSS-Enabled Windows Backup .
