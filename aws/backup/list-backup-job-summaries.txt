OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          Returns the job count for the specified account.

          If the request is sent from a member account or an account not  part
          of  Amazon  Web  Services Organizations, jobs within requestor's ac-
          count will be returned.

          Root, admin, and delegated administrator accounts can use the  value
          ANY to return job counts from every account in the organization.
              AGGREGATE_ALL aggregates job counts from all accounts within the
              authenticated organization, then returns the sum.

       --state (string)
          This parameter returns the job count for  jobs  with  the  specified
          state.

          The the value ANY returns count of all states.
              AGGREGATE_ALL  aggregates  job counts for all states and returns
              the sum.

              Completed with issues is a status found only in the Backup  con-
              sole.  For  API, this status refers to jobs with a state of COM-
              PLETED and a MessageCategory with a value other than  SUCCESS  ;
              that  is,  the  status is completed but comes with a status mes-
              sage. To obtain the job count for Completed with  issues  ,  run
              two GET requests, and subtract the second, smaller number:

          GET              /audit/backup-job-summaries?AggregationPeriod=FOUR-
          TEEN_DAYS&State=COMPLETED

          GET /audit/backup-job-summaries?AggregationPeriod=FOURTEEN_DAYS&Mes-
          sageCategory=SUCCESS&State=COMPLETED

          Possible values:

          o CREATED

          types.

          The the value ANY returns count of all resource types.
              AGGREGATE_ALL  aggregates  job counts for all resource types and
              returns the sum.

          gory.

          validParameters . See Monitoring for a list of accepted MessageCate-
          gory strings.

          Acceptable values include

          o ONE_DAY for daily job count for the prior 14 days.

          o SEVEN_DAYS for the aggregated job count for the prior 7 days.

       --next-token (string)

          starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
