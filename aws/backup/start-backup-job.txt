OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

       --resource-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies  a  resource.
          The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.

       --iam-role-arn (string)
          Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point;
          for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A customer-chosen string that you can  use  to  distinguish  between
          otherwise  identical calls to StartBackupJob . Retrying a successful
          request with the same idempotency token results in a success message
          with no action taken.

       --start-window-minutes (long)
          A  value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be
          canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value  is  optional,
          and the default is 8 hours. If this value is included, it must be at
          least 60 minutes to avoid errors.

       --complete-window-minutes (long)
          A value in minutes during which a successfully started  backup  must
          complete,  or  else  Backup  will  cancel the job. This value is op-
          tional. This value begins counting down from  when  the  backup  was
          scheduled.  It does not add additional time for StartWindowMinutes ,
          or if the backup started later than scheduled.

       --lifecycle (structure)
          The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is  transitioned  to
          cold  storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire
          backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.

          Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold  storage
          for  a  minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the retention setting must be
          90 days greater than the transition to cold after days setting.  The
          transition  to  cold  after  days  setting cannot be changed after a
          backup has been transitioned to cold.

          Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold storage  are
          listed  in  the  "Lifecycle  to cold storage" section of the Feature
          availability by resource table. Backup ignores this  expression  for
          other resource types.

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies  the  number  of  days  after creation that a recovery
              point is moved to cold storage.

          DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days  after  creation  that  a  recovery
              point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus MoveToCold-
              StorageAfterDays .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MoveToColdStorageAfterDays=long,DeleteAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MoveToColdStorageAfterDays": long,
            "DeleteAfterDays": long
          }

       --recovery-point-tags (map)
          To help organize your resources, you can assign your own metadata to
          the resources that you create. Each tag is a key-value pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --backup-options (map)
          Specifies  the backup option for a selected resource. This option is
          only available for Windows Volume Shadow Copy Service  (VSS)  backup
          jobs.

          Valid values: Set to "WindowsVSS":"enabled" to enable the WindowsVSS
          backup option  and  create  a  Windows  VSS  backup.  Set  to  "Win-
          dowsVSS""disabled" to create a regular backup. The WindowsVSS option
          is not enabled by default.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
