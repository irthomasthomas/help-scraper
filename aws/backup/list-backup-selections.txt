LIST-BACKUP-SELECTIONS()                              LIST-BACKUP-SELECTIONS()



NAME
       list-backup-selections -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array containing metadata of the resources associated with
       the target backup plan.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-backup-selections is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: BackupSelectionsList

SYNOPSIS
            list-backup-selections
          --backup-plan-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-plan-id (string)
          Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       BackupSelectionsList -> (list)
          An array of backup selection list items  containing  metadata  about
          each resource in the list.

          (structure)
              Contains metadata about a BackupSelection object.

              SelectionId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies a request to assign a set of resources to
                 a backup plan.

              SelectionName -> (string)
                 The display name of a resource selection document.

              BackupPlanId -> (string)
                 Uniquely identifies a backup plan.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a backup plan is created,  in  Unix  format
                 and  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of Creation-
                 Date is accurate to  milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087    represents   Friday,   January   26,   2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              CreatorRequestId -> (string)
                 A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed
                 requests to be retried without the risk of running the opera-
                 tion twice. This parameter is optional.

                 If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric  or
                 '-_.' characters.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  IAM role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to create
                 the     target     recovery     point;      for      example,
                 arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .
