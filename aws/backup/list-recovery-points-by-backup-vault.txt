NAME
       list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed  information  about  the  recovery points stored in a
       backup vault.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: RecoveryPoints

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.

          NOTE:
              Backup vault name might not be available when a  supported  ser-
              vice creates the backup.

       --by-resource-arn (string)
          Returns  only recovery points that match the specified resource Ama-
          zon Resource Name (ARN).

       --by-resource-type (string)
          Returns only recovery points that match the specified resource type.

       --by-backup-plan-id (string)
          Returns only recovery points that match the  specified  backup  plan
          ID.

       --by-created-before (timestamp)
          Returns  only recovery points that were created before the specified
          timestamp.

       --by-created-after (timestamp)
          Returns only recovery points that were created after  the  specified
          timestamp.

       --by-parent-recovery-point-arn (string)
          This  returns  only  recovery points that match the specified parent
          (composite) recovery point Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                 tion failure.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value

                 ColdStorageAt timestamps.

                 MoveToColdStorageAt -> (timestamp)
                     A timestamp that specifies when to transition a  recovery
                     point to cold storage.

                 DeleteAt -> (timestamp)
                     A  timestamp  that  specifies  when  to delete a recovery
                     point.

              Lifecycle -> (structure)
                 The lifecycle defines when a protected  resource  is  transi-
                 tioned  to  cold  storage and when it expires. Backup transi-
                 tions and expires  backups  automatically  according  to  the
                 lifecycle that you define.

                 Backups  transitioned  to cold storage must be stored in cold
                 storage for a minimum of 90 days.  Therefore,  the  retention
                 setting  must  be 90 days greater than the transition to cold
                 after days setting. The transition to cold after days setting
                 cannot  be  changed  after  a backup has been transitioned to
                 cold.

                 Resource types that are able to be transitioned to cold stor-
                 age  are listed in the "Lifecycle to cold storage" section of
                 the Feature availability by resource  table.  Backup  ignores
                 this expression for other resource types.

                 MoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery point is moved to cold storage.

                 DeleteAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days after creation that a recov-
                     ery  point  is deleted. Must be greater than 90 days plus
                     MoveToColdStorageAfterDays .

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              IsEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 A Boolean value that is returned as TRUE if the specified re-
                 covery point is encrypted, or FALSE if the recovery point  is
                 not encrypted.

              LastRestoreTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
                 format and Coordinated Universal Time  (UTC).  The  value  of
                 LastRestoreTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value 1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26,  2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              ParentRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the parent (compos-
                 ite) recovery point.

              CompositeMemberIdentifier -> (string)
                 This is the identifier  of  a  resource  within  a  composite
                 group,  such  as nested (child) recovery point belonging to a
                 composite (parent) stack. The  ID  is  transferred  from  the
                 logical ID within a stack.

              IsParent -> (boolean)
                 This  is a boolean value indicating this is a parent (compos-
                 ite) recovery point.

              ResourceName -> (string)
                 This is the non-unique name of the resource that  belongs  to
                 the specified backup.
