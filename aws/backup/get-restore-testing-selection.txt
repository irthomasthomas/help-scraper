OPTIONS
       --restore-testing-plan-name (string)
          Required unique name of the restore testing plan.

       --restore-testing-selection-name (string)
          Required unique name of the restore testing selection.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,

OUTPUT
       RestoreTestingSelection -> (structure)
          Unique name of the restore testing selection.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time that a restore testing selection was created,
              in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The  value
              of  CreationTime  is  accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
              value   1516925490.087   represents    Friday,    January    26,
              201812:11:30.087 AM.

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              This identifies the request and allows failed requests to be re-
              tried without the risk of running the operation  twice.  If  the
              request  includes  a  CreatorRequestId  that matches an existing
              backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

              '-_.' characters.

              ple:arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .
