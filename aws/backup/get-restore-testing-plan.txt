OPTIONS
       --restore-testing-plan-name (string)
          Required unique name of the restore testing plan.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          ingPlanName .

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that a restore testing plan  was  created,  in
              Unix  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of
              CreationTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
              1516925490.087  represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087

          CreatorRequestId -> (string)
              This identifies the request and allows failed requests to be re-
              tried  without  the  risk of running the operation twice. If the
              request includes a CreatorRequestId  that  matches  an  existing
              backup plan, that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

              If  used,  this  parameter  must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or
              '-_.' characters.

          LastExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time a restore test was run with the specified  restore
              testing  plan.  A  date and time, in Unix format and Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC). The value of LastExecutionDate is accurate
              to  milliseconds.  For  example, the value 1516925490.087 repre-
              sents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the restore  testing  plan  was  updated.
              This  update  is  in  Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time
              (UTC). The value of LastUpdateTime is accurate to  milliseconds.
              For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January
              26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

                 ...] ["arn:aws:backup:::backup-vault:asdf-
