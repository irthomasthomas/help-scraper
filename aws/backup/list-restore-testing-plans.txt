NAME
       list-restore-testing-plans -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of restore testing plans.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-restore-testing-plans is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: RestoreTestingPlans

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  MaxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the nexttoken.

       RestoreTestingPlans -> (list)
          This is a returned list of restore testing plans.

          (structure)
              This contains metadata about a restore testing plan.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that a restore testing plan was created, in
                 Unix  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value
                 of CreationTime is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the
                 value  1516925490.087  represents  Friday,  January  26, 2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              LastExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time a restore test was run with the  specified  re-
                 store testing plan. A date and time, in Unix format and Coor-
                 dinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  LastExecutionDate
                 is   accurate   to   milliseconds.  For  example,  the  value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time that the restore testing plan was updated.
                 This update is in Unix format and Coordinated Universal  Time
                 (UTC).  The  value of LastUpdateTime is accurate to millisec-
                 onds. For example, the value 1516925490.087  represents  Fri-
                 day, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.

              RestoreTestingPlanArn -> (string)
                 An  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifiesa re-
                 store testing plan.

              RestoreTestingPlanName -> (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A CRON expression in specified timezone when a restore  test-
                 ing plan is executed.

              ScheduleExpressionTimezone -> (string)
                 Optional.  This is the timezone in which the schedule expres-
                 sion is set. By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC.  You
                 can modify this to a specified timezone.

              StartWindowHours -> (integer)
                 Defaults to 24 hours.

                 A  value  in hours after a restore test is scheduled before a
                 job will be canceled if it doesn't start  successfully.  This
                 value  is optional. If this value is included, this parameter
                 has a maximum value of 168 hours (one week).
