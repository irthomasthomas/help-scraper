DELETE-RECOVERY-POINT()                                DELETE-RECOVERY-POINT()



NAME
       delete-recovery-point -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the recovery point specified by a recovery point ID.

       If  the  recovery point ID belongs to a continuous backup, calling this
       endpoint deletes the existing continuous backup and stops  future  con-
       tinuous backup.

       When  an  IAM role's permissions are insufficient to call this API, the
       service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty  HTTP  body,  but
       the recovery point is not deleted. Instead, it enters an EXPIRED state.
          EXPIRED  recovery  points  can be deleted with this API once the IAM
          role has the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole action. To learn more about
          adding this role, see Troubleshooting manual deletions .

       If the user or role is deleted or the permission within the role is re-
       moved, the deletion will not be successful and will  enter  an  EXPIRED
       state.

OPTIONS
       --backup-vault-name (string)
          The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored. Backup
          vaults are identified by names that are unique to the  account  used
          to  create  them  and  the Amazon Web Services Region where they are
          created.

       --recovery-point-arn (string)
          An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely  identifies  a  recovery
          point;   for  example,  arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
          ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
