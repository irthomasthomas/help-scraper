NAME
       list-recovery-points-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about all the recovery points of the type
       specified by a resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       NOTE:
          For Amazon EFS and Amazon  EC2,  this  action  only  lists  recovery
          points created by Backup.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-recovery-points-by-resource is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: RecoveryPoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-recovery-points-by-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          An ARN that uniquely identifies a resource. The format  of  the  ARN
          depends on the resource type.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next item following a partial list of returned items. For exam-
          ple, if a request is made to  return  maxResults  number  of  items,
          NextToken  allows  you to return more items in your list starting at
          the location pointed to by the next token.

       RecoveryPoints -> (list)
          An array of objects that contain detailed information about recovery
          points of the specified resource type.

          NOTE:
              Only  Amazon  EFS  and Amazon EC2 recovery points return Backup-
              VaultName.

          (structure)
              Contains detailed information about a saved recovery point.

              RecoveryPointArn -> (string)
                 An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a  re-
                 covery             point;             for            example,
                 arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recov-
                 ery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45 .

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format
                 and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of  Creation-
                 Date  is  accurate  to  milliseconds.  For example, the value
                 1516925490.087   represents   Friday,   January   26,    2018
                 12:11:30.087 AM.

              Status -> (string)
                 A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 A  message  explaining the reason of the recovery point dele-
                 tion failure.

              EncryptionKeyArn -> (string)
                 The server-side encryption key that is used to  protect  your
                 backups;                     for                     example,
                 arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
                 .

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of a backup.

              BackupVaultName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  logical container where backups are stored.
                 Backup vaults are identified by names that are unique to  the
                 account  used  to create them and the Amazon Web Services Re-
                 gion where they are created. They consist of  lowercase  let-
                 ters, numbers, and hyphens.
