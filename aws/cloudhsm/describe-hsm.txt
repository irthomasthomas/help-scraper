OPTIONS
       --hsm-arn (string)
          The ARN of the HSM. Either the HsmArn or the SerialNumber  parameter
          must be specified.

       --hsm-serial-number (string)
          The serial number of the HSM. Either the HsmArn or the HsmSerialNum-
          ber parameter must be specified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
