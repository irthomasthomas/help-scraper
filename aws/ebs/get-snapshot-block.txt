GET-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()                                      GET-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()



NAME
       get-snapshot-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the data in a block in an Amazon Elastic Block Store snapshot.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-snapshot-block
          --snapshot-id <value>
          --block-index <value>
          --block-token <value>
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot containing the block from which to get data.

          WARNING:
              If the specified snapshot is encrypted, you must have permission
              to use the KMS key that was used to encrypt  the  snapshot.  For
              more  information,  see  Using  encryption in the Amazon Elastic
              Compute Cloud User Guide .

       --block-index (integer)
          The block index of the block in which to read the data. A block  in-
          dex  is  a logical index in units of 512 KiB blocks. To identify the
          block index, divide the logical offset of the data  in  the  logical
          volume by the block size (logical offset of data/524288 ). The logi-
          cal offset of the data must be 512 KiB aligned.

       --block-token (string)
          The block token of the block from which to get data. You can  obtain
          the  BlockToken  by  running  the ListChangedBlocks or ListSnapshot-
          Blocks operations.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DataLength -> (integer)
          The size of the data in the block.

       BlockData -> (blob)
          The data content of the block.

       Checksum -> (string)
          The checksum generated for the block, which is Base64 encoded.

       ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
          The algorithm used to generate the checksum for the block,  such  as
          SHA256.
