START-SNAPSHOT()                                              START-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       start-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new Amazon EBS snapshot. The new snapshot enters the pending
       state after the request completes.

       After creating the snapshot, use PutSnapshotBlock to  write  blocks  of
       data to the snapshot.

OPTIONS
       --volume-size (long)
          The  size  of  the volume, in GiB. The maximum size is 65536 GiB (64
          TiB).

       --parent-snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the parent snapshot. If there is no parent snapshot, or if
          you  are creating the first snapshot for an on-premises volume, omit
          this parameter.

          You can't specify ParentSnapshotId and Encrypted  in  the  same  re-
          quest.  If you specify both parameters, the request fails with Vali-
          dationException .

          The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
          specify  for  Encrypted  ,  KmsKeyArn  ,  and ParentSnapshotId , and
          whether your Amazon Web Services account is enabled  for  encryption
          by  default . For more information, see Using encryption in the Ama-
          zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          WARNING:
              If you specify an encrypted parent snapshot, you must have  per-
              mission  to  use the KMS key that was used to encrypt the parent
              snapshot. For more information, see Permissions to use Key  Man-
              agement  Service  keys  in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
              Guide .

       --tags (list)
          The tags to apply to the snapshot.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --description (string)
          A description for the snapshot.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to  ensure  the
          idempotency  of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request
          completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original re-
          quest  completes  successfully. The subsequent retries with the same
          client token return the result from the original successful  request
          and they have no additional effect.

          If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated
          by the Amazon Web Services SDK.

          For more information, see Idempotency for StartSnapshot API  in  the
          Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          Indicates whether to encrypt the snapshot.

          You  can't  specify  Encrypted  and ParentSnapshotId in the same re-
          quest. If you specify both parameters, the request fails with  Vali-
          dationException .

          The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
          specify for Encrypted ,  KmsKeyArn  ,  and  ParentSnapshotId  ,  and
          whether  your  Amazon Web Services account is enabled for encryption
          by default . For more information, see Using encryption in the  Ama-
          zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          WARNING:
              To create an encrypted snapshot, you must have permission to use
              the KMS key. For more information, see Permissions  to  use  Key
              Management Service keys in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
              Guide .

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management  Service  (KMS)
          key to be used to encrypt the snapshot.

          The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
          specify for Encrypted ,  KmsKeyArn  ,  and  ParentSnapshotId  ,  and
          whether  your  Amazon Web Services account is enabled for encryption
          by default . For more information, see Using encryption in the  Ama-
          zon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

          WARNING:
              To create an encrypted snapshot, you must have permission to use
              the KMS key. For more information, see Permissions  to  use  Key
              Management Service keys in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User
              Guide .

       --timeout (integer)
          The amount of time (in minutes) after which the snapshot is automat-
          ically cancelled if:

          o No blocks are written to the snapshot.

          o The  snapshot  is  not  completed  after writing the last block of
            data.

          If no value is specified, the timeout defaults to 60 minutes.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.
