PUT-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()                                      PUT-SNAPSHOT-BLOCK()



NAME
       put-snapshot-block -

DESCRIPTION
       Writes  a  block of data to a snapshot. If the specified block contains
       data, the existing data is overwritten. The target snapshot must be  in
       the pending state.

       Data written to a snapshot must be aligned with 512-KiB sectors.

       NOTE:
          You  should  always  retry requests that receive server (5xx ) error
          responses,  and  ThrottlingException  and  RequestThrottledException
          client  error  responses.  For more information see Error retries in
          the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --snapshot-id (string)
          The ID of the snapshot.

          WARNING:
              If the specified snapshot is encrypted, you must have permission
              to  use  the  KMS key that was used to encrypt the snapshot. For
              more information, see Using encryption  in  the  Amazon  Elastic
              Compute Cloud User Guide ..

       --block-index (integer)
          The block index of the block in which to write the data. A block in-
          dex is a logical index in units of 512 KiB blocks. To  identify  the
          block  index,  divide  the logical offset of the data in the logical
          volume by the block size (logical offset of data/524288 ). The logi-
          cal offset of the data must be 512 KiB aligned.

       --block-data (streaming blob)
          The data to write to the block.

          The  block  data  is  not  signed as part of the Signature Version 4
          signing process. As a  result,  you  must  generate  and  provide  a
          Base64-encoded   SHA256  checksum  for  the  block  data  using  the
          x-amz-Checksum header. Also, you must specify the checksum algorithm
          using  the  x-amz-Checksum-Algorithm  header.  The checksum that you
          provide is part of the Signature Version 4 signing  process.  It  is
          validated  against  a checksum generated by Amazon EBS to ensure the
          validity and authenticity of the data. If the checksums do not  cor-
          respond,  the  request fails. For more information, see Using check-
          sums with the EBS direct APIs in the Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud
          User Guide .

          NOTE:
              This  argument is of type: streaming blob. Its value must be the
              path to a file (e.g. path/to/file) and must not be prefixed with
              file:// or fileb://

       --data-length (integer)
          The size of the data to write to the block, in bytes. Currently, the
          only supported size is 524288 bytes.

          Valid values: 524288

       --progress (integer)
          The progress of the write process, as a percentage.

       --checksum (string)
          A Base64-encoded SHA256 checksum of the data. Only SHA256  checksums
          are supported.

       --checksum-algorithm (string)
          The  algorithm  used  to  generate the checksum. Currently, the only
          supported algorithm is SHA256 .

          Possible values:

          o SHA256

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Checksum -> (string)
          The SHA256 checksum generated for the block data by Amazon EBS.

       ChecksumAlgorithm -> (string)
          The algorithm used by Amazon EBS to generate the checksum.
