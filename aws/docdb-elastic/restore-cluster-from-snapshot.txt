OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the elastic cluster.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  KMS  key identifier to use to encrypt the new Amazon DocumentDB
          elastic clusters cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption  key. If you are creating a cluster using the same Amazon
          account that owns this KMS encryption key, you can use the  KMS  key
          alias instead of the ARN as the KMS encryption key.

          If  an  encryption key is not specified here, Amazon DocumentDB uses
          the default encryption key that KMS creates for your  account.  Your
          account  has  a different default encryption key for each Amazon Re-
          gion.

       --shard-capacity (integer)
          The capacity of each shard in the new restored elastic cluster.

       --shard-instance-count (integer)
          The number of replica instances applying to all shards in the  elas-
          tic  cluster.  A  shardInstanceCount  value  of 1 means there is one
          writer instance, and any additional instances are replicas that  can
          be used for reads and to improve availability.

       --snapshot-arn (string)
          The ARN identifier of the elastic cluster snapshot.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The Amazon EC2 subnet IDs for the elastic cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          A list of the tag names to be assigned to the restored elastic clus-
          ter, in the form of an array of key-value pairs in which the key  is
          the tag name and the value is the key value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A  list  of  EC2  VPC  security groups to associate with the elastic
          cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)
