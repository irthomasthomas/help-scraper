OPTIONS
       --admin-user-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters administrator.
              Constraints :

          o Must be from 1 to 63 letters or numbers.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot be a reserved word.

       --admin-user-password (string)
          The password for the Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters  administra-
          tor. The password can contain any printable ASCII characters.
              Constraints :

          o Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.

          o Cannot  contain a forward slash (/), double quote ("), or the "at"
            symbol (@).

       --auth-type (string)
          The authentication type used to determine where to fetch  the  pass-
          word  used  for  accessing  the  elastic  cluster.  Valid  types are
          PLAIN_TEXT or SECRET_ARN .

          Possible values:

          o PLAIN_TEXT

          o SECRET_ARN

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days for which automatic snapshots are retained.

       --client-token (string)
          The client token for the elastic cluster.

       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the new elastic cluster. This parameter is stored  as  a
          lowercase string.
              Constraints :

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

              Example : my-cluster

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key identifier to use to encrypt the new elastic cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same  Amazon
          account  that  owns this KMS encryption key, you can use the KMS key
          alias instead of the ARN as the KMS encryption key.

          If an encryption key is not specified, Amazon  DocumentDB  uses  the
          default  encryption  key that KMS creates for your account. Your ac-
          count has a different default encryption key for each Amazon Region.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The daily time range during which automated backups are  created  if
          automated backups are enabled, as determined by the backupRetention-
          Period .

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur,  in
          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
              Format : ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

              Default  :  a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
              block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring  on
              a random day of the week.

              Valid days : Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

              Constraints : Minimum 30-minute window.

       --shard-capacity (integer)
          The  number of vCPUs assigned to each elastic cluster shard. Maximum
          is 64. Allowed values are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

       --shard-count (integer)
          The number of shards assigned to the elastic cluster. Maximum is 32.

       --shard-instance-count (integer)
          The number of replica instances applying to all shards in the  elas-
          tic  cluster.  A  shardInstanceCount  value  of 1 means there is one
          writer instance, and any additional instances are replicas that  can
          be used for reads and to improve availability.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The Amazon EC2 subnet IDs for the new elastic cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be assigned to the new elastic cluster.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A  list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the new elastic
          cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
