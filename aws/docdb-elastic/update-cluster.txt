          slash (/), double quote ("), or the "at" symbol (@).
              Constraints : Must contain from 8 to 100 characters.

       --auth-type (string)
          The  authentication  type used to determine where to fetch the pass-
          word used  for  accessing  the  elastic  cluster.  Valid  types  are
          PLAIN_TEXT or SECRET_ARN .

          Possible values:

          o PLAIN_TEXT

          o SECRET_ARN

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily  time range during which automated backups are created if
          automated backups are enabled, as determined by the backupRetention-
          Period .

          The  weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
              Format : ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

              Default : a 30-minute window selected at random from  an  8-hour
              block  of time for each Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on
              a random day of the week.

              Valid days : Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

              Constraints : Minimum 30-minute window.

       --shard-instance-count (integer)
          The  number of replica instances applying to all shards in the elas-
          tic cluster. A shardInstanceCount value of  1  means  there  is  one

          be used for reads and to improve availability.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The Amazon EC2 subnet IDs for the elastic cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
