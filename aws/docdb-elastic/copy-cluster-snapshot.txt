OPTIONS
       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          Set to true to copy all tags from the source cluster snapshot to the
          target elastic cluster snapshot. The default is false .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key ID for an encrypted elastic  cluster
          snapshot.  The Amazon Web Services KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN), Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier,  or  the  Amazon
          Web  Services  KMS key alias for the Amazon Web Services KMS encryp-
          tion key.

          If you copy an encrypted elastic cluster snapshot from  your  Amazon
          Web  Services  account,  you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to en-
          crypt the copy with a new Amazon Web ServicesS KMS  encryption  key.
          If  you  don't  specify  a value for KmsKeyId , then the copy of the
          elastic cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same AWS KMS  key  as
          the source elastic cluster snapshot.

          To  copy an encrypted elastic cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web
          Services region, set KmsKeyId to the Amazon Web Services KMS key  ID
          that  you  want  to  use  to encrypt the copy of the elastic cluster
          snapshot in the destination region. Amazon Web Services KMS  encryp-
          tion  keys  are specific to the Amazon Web Services region that they
          are created in, and you can't use encryption keys  from  one  Amazon
          Web Services region in another Amazon Web Services region.

          If  you  copy  an unencrypted elastic cluster snapshot and specify a
          value for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --snapshot-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) identifier  of  the  elastic  cluster
          snapshot.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be assigned to the elastic cluster snapshot.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --target-snapshot-name (string)
          The  identifier  of  the new elastic cluster snapshot to create from
          the source cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: elastic-cluster-snapshot-5

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       snapshot -> (structure)
          Returns information about a specific elastic cluster snapshot.

          adminUserName -> (string)
              The name of the elastic cluster administrator.

          clusterArn -> (string)
              The ARN identifier of the elastic cluster.

          clusterCreationTime -> (string)
              The time when the elastic cluster was created in Universal Coor-
              dinated Time (UTC).

          kmsKeyId -> (string)
              The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
              KMS encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same
              Amazon  account  that  owns this KMS encryption key, you can use
              the KMS key alias instead of the ARN as the KMS encryption  key.
              If  an  encryption  key is not specified here, Amazon DocumentDB
              uses the default encryption key that KMS creates  for  your  ac-
              count.  Your  account has a different default encryption key for
              each Amazon Region.

          snapshotArn -> (string)
              The ARN identifier of the elastic cluster snapshot.

          snapshotCreationTime -> (string)
              The time when the elastic cluster snapshot was created  in  Uni-
              versal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          snapshotName -> (string)
              The name of the elastic cluster snapshot.

          snapshotType -> (string)
              The  type  of  cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify
              one of the following values:

              o automated - Return all cluster  snapshots  that  Amazon  Docu-
                mentDB  has automatically created for your Amazon Web Services
                account.

              o manual - Return all cluster snapshots that you  have  manually
                created for your Amazon Web Services account.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the elastic cluster snapshot.

          subnetIds -> (list)
              The Amazon EC2 subnet IDs for the elastic cluster.

              (string)

          vpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              A  list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the elastic
