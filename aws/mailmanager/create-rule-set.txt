OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A  unique token that Amazon SES uses to recognize subsequent retries
          of the same request.

       --rule-set-name (string)
          A user-friendly name for the rule set.

       --rules (list)
          Conditional rules that are  evaluated  for  determining  actions  on
          email.

          (structure)
              A rule contains conditions, "unless conditions" and actions. For
              each envelope recipient of an email, if all conditions match and
              none  of  the "unless conditions" match, then all of the actions
              are executed sequentially. If no conditions  are  provided,  the
              rule  always applies and the actions are implicitly executed. If
              only "unless conditions" are provided, the rule applies  if  the
              email does not match the evaluation of the "unless conditions".

              Actions -> (list)
                 The  list of actions to execute when the conditions match the
                 incoming email, and none of the "unless conditions" match.

                 (tagged union structure)
                     The action for a rule to take. Only one of the  contained
                     actions can be set.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be set: AddHeader,  Archive,
                        DeliverToMailbox, DeliverToQBusiness, Drop, Relay, Re-
                        placeRecipient, Send, WriteToS3.

                     AddHeader -> (structure)
                        This action adds a header. This can be used to add ar-
                        bitrary email headers.

                        HeaderName -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the  header to add to an email. The
                            header must be prefixed  with  "X-".  Headers  are
                            added   regardless  of  whether  the  header  name
                            pre-existed in the email.

                        HeaderValue -> (string)
                            The value of the header to add to the email.

                     Archive -> (structure)
                        This action archives the email. This can  be  used  to
                        deliver an email to an archive.

                        ActionFailurePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  states  what to do in the case of
                            failure. The action will fail if there are config-
                            uration errors. For example, the specified archive
                            has been deleted.

                            failure. The action will fail if there are config-
                            uration errors. For example, the specified  appli-
                            cation  has  been deleted or the role lacks neces-
                            sary permissions to call  the  qbusiness:BatchPut-

                            role  must  have access to the qbusiness:BatchPut-
                            Document API for the given application and index.

                     Drop -> (structure)
                        This action terminates the evaluation of rules in  the
                        rule set.

                     Relay -> (structure)
                        This action relays the email to another SMTP server.

                        ActionFailurePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  states  what to do in the case of
                            failure. The action will fail if there are config-
                            uration  errors.  For example, the specified relay
                            has been deleted.

                        MailFrom -> (string)

                     WriteToS3 -> (structure)
                        This action writes the MIME content of the email to an
                        S3 bucket.

                        ActionFailurePolicy -> (string)
                            A  policy  that  states  what to do in the case of
                            failure. The action will fail if there are config-

              Conditions -> (list)
                 The  conditions  of  this rule. All conditions must match the
                 email for the actions to be executed. An empty list of condi-
                 tions  means  that all emails match, but are still subject to
                 any "unless conditions"

                 (tagged union structure)
                     The conditional expression used to evaluate an email  for
                     determining if a rule action should be taken.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-
                        lowing top level keys can be  set:  BooleanExpression,
                        DmarcExpression,    IpExpression,    NumberExpression,
                        StringExpression, VerdictExpression.

                     BooleanExpression -> (structure)
                        The condition applies to a boolean  expression  passed
                        in this field.

                        Evaluate -> (tagged union structure)
                            The  operand  on which to perform a boolean condi-
                            tion operation.

                            NOTE:
                               This is a Tagged Union structure. Only  one  of
                               the following top level keys can be set: Attri-
                               bute.

                            Attribute -> (string)
                               The boolean type representing the  allowed  at-
                               tribute types for an email.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            The  matching operator for a boolean condition ex-
                            pression.

                     DmarcExpression -> (structure)
                        The condition applies to  a  DMARC  policy  expression
                        passed in this field.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            The  operator  to apply to the DMARC policy of the
                            incoming email.

                        Values -> (list)
                            The values to use for the given DMARC policy oper-
                            ator.  For the operator EQUALS, if multiple values
                            are given, they are evaluated as an OR.  That  is,
                            if any of the given values match, the condition is
                            deemed to match. For the operator  NOT_EQUALS,  if
                            multiple  values  are given, they are evaluated as
                            an AND. That is, only if the email's DMARC  policy
                            is  not equal to any of the given values, then the
                            condition is deemed to match.

                            (string)

                     IpExpression -> (structure)
                        The condition applies  to  an  IP  address  expression
                        passed in this field.

                        Evaluate -> (tagged union structure)
                            The IP address to evaluate in this condition.

                            NOTE:
                               This  is  a Tagged Union structure. Only one of
                               the following top level keys can be set: Attri-
                               bute.

                            Attribute -> (string)
                               The attribute of the email to evaluate.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            The operator to evaluate the IP address.

                        Values -> (list)
                            The  IP  CIDR  blocks  in  format  "x.y.z.w/n" (eg
                            10.0.0.0/8) to match with the email's IP  address.
                            For  the operator CIDR_MATCHES, if multiple values
                            are given, they are evaluated as an OR.  That  is,
                            if  the  IP address is contained within any of the
                            given CIDR ranges,  the  condition  is  deemed  to
                            match.  For  NOT_CIDR_MATCHES,  if  multiple  CIDR
                            ranges are given, the condition is deemed to match
                            if  the  IP address is not contained in any of the
                            given CIDR ranges.

                            (string)

                     NumberExpression -> (structure)
                        The condition applies to a number expression passed in
                        this field.

                        Evaluate -> (tagged union structure)
                            The  number to evaluate in a numeric condition ex-
                            pression.

                            multiple values are given, the condition is deemed
                            to  match  if any of the given verdicts match that
                            of the email. For the NOT_EQUALS operator, if mul-
                            tiple values are given, the condition is deemed to
                            match of none of the given verdicts match the ver-
                            dict of the email.

          source. For example, { "tags": {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"} }.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair (the value is optional), that  you  can  define
              and assign to Amazon Web Services resources.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the key-value tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the key-value tag.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
