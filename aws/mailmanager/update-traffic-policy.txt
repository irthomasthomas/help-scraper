OPTIONS
       --default-action (string)
          Default  action  instructs  the  trac policy to either Allow or Deny
          (block) messages that fall outside of (or not addressed by) the con-
          ditions of your policy statements

          Possible values:

          o ALLOW

          o DENY

       --max-message-size-bytes (integer)
          The  maximum  message  size in bytes of email which is allowed in by
          this traffic policyanything larger will be blocked.

       --policy-statements (list)
          The list of conditions to be updated for filtering email traffic.

          (structure)
              The structure containing traffic policy conditions and actions.

              Action -> (string)
                 The action that informs a traffic policy resource  to  either
                 allow  or  block  the  email if it matches a condition in the
                 policy statement.

              Conditions -> (list)
                 The list of conditions to apply to incoming messages for fil-
                 tering email traffic.

                 (tagged union structure)

                     tained in a traffic policy resource.

                     NOTE:
                        This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the fol-

                        configured in 'Operator' and evaluates the  'Protocol'

       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The identifier of the traffic policy that you want to update.

       --traffic-policy-name (string)
          A user-friendly name for the traffic policy resource.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
