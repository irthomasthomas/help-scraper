CREATE-DETECTOR()                                            CREATE-DETECTOR()



NAME
       create-detector -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a single GuardDuty detector. A detector is a resource that rep-
       resents the GuardDuty service. To start using GuardDuty, you must  cre-
       ate  a  detector  in  each Region where you enable the service. You can
       have only one detector per account per Region. All data sources are en-
       abled in a new detector by default.

       o When  you  don't  specify  any  features  , with an exception to RUN-
         TIME_MONITORING , all the optional features are enabled by default.

       o When you specify some of the features , any feature that is not spec-
         ified  in  the API call gets enabled by default, with an exception to
         RUNTIME_MONITORING .

       Specifying both EKS Runtime Monitoring  (EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING  )  and
       Runtime  Monitoring  (RUNTIME_MONITORING ) will cause an error. You can
       add only one of these two features because Runtime  Monitoring  already
       includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources. For more infor-
       mation, see Runtime Monitoring .

       There might be regional differences because some data sources might not
       be  available in all the Amazon Web Services Regions where GuardDuty is
       presently supported. For more information, see Regions and endpoints .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
