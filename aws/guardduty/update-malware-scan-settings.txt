OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)

       --scan-resource-criteria (structure)

          sources to scan.

          Include -> (map)

              for a certain resource.

              key -> (string)
                 An enum value representing possible  resource  properties  to
                 match with given scan condition.

              value -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the condition.

                 MapEquals -> (list)
                     Represents an mapEqual  condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when triggering for malware scan.

                     (structure)
                        Represents key, value pair to be matched against given
                        resource property.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Represents key  in the map condition.

                        Value -> (string)
                            Represents  optional  value  in the map condition.
                            If not specified, only key  will be matched.

          Exclude -> (map)
              Represents condition that when matched will  prevent  a  malware
              scan for a certain resource.

              key -> (string)
                 An  enum  value  representing possible resource properties to
                 match with given scan condition.

              value -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the condition.

                 MapEquals -> (list)

       --ebs-snapshot-preservation (string)
          An enum value representing possible snapshot preservations.

          Possible values:

          o NO_RETENTION

          o RETENTION_WITH_FINDING

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
