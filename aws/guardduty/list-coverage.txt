LIST-COVERAGE()                                                LIST-COVERAGE()



NAME
       list-coverage -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  coverage  details for your GuardDuty account. If you're a Guard-
       Duty administrator, you can retrieve all resources associated with  the
       active member accounts in your organization.

       Make  sure  the  accounts have Runtime Monitoring enabled and GuardDuty
       agent running on their resources.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-coverage is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Resources

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)

          trieve.

       --filter-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used to filter the coverage details.

          FilterCriterion -> (list)
              Represents a condition that when matched will be  added  to  the
              response of the operation.

                 CriterionKey -> (string)
                     An enum value representing possible filter fields.

                     NOTE:

                        Represents a not equal condition that is applied to  a
                        single field while retrieving the coverage details.

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilterCriterion": [
              {
                "CriterionKey": "ACCOUNT_ID"|"CLUSTER_NAME"|"RESOURCE_TYPE"|"COVERAGE_STATUS"|"ADDON_VERSION"|"MANAGEMENT_TYPE"|"EKS_CLUSTER_NAME"|"ECS_CLUSTER_NAME"|"AGENT_VERSION"|"INSTANCE_ID"|"CLUSTER_ARN",
                "FilterCondition": {
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],
                  "NotEquals": ["string", ...]
                }
              }

            ]
          }

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used to sort the coverage details.

          AttributeName -> (string)
              Represents the field name used to sort the coverage details.

              NOTE:
                 Replace  the  enum value CLUSTER_NAME with EKS_CLUSTER_NAME .
                 CLUSTER_NAME has been deprecated.

          OrderBy -> (string)
              The order in which the sorted findings are to be displayed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,OrderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AttributeName": "ACCOUNT_ID"|"CLUSTER_NAME"|"COVERAGE_STATUS"|"ISSUE"|"ADDON_VERSION"|"UPDATED_AT"|"EKS_CLUSTER_NAME"|"ECS_CLUSTER_NAME"|"INSTANCE_ID",
            "OrderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
