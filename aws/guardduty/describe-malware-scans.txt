DESCRIBE-MALWARE-SCANS()                              DESCRIBE-MALWARE-SCANS()



NAME
       describe-malware-scans -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of malware scans. Each member account can view the mal-
       ware scans for their own accounts. An administrator can view  the  mal-
       ware scans for all the member accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-malware-scans is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Scans

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector that the request is associated with.

       --filter-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria to be used in the filter for describing scan
          entries.

          FilterCriterion -> (list)
              Represents  a  condition  that when matched will be added to the
              response of the operation.

              (structure)
                 Represents a condition that when matched will be added to the
                 response  of  the operation. Irrespective of using any filter
                 criteria, an administrator account can view the scan  entries
                 for  all of its member accounts. However, each member account
                 can view the scan entries only for their own account.

                 CriterionKey -> (string)
                     An enum value representing possible  scan  properties  to
                     match with given scan entries.

                 FilterCondition -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the condition.

                     EqualsValue -> (string)
                        Represents an equal  condition to be applied to a sin-
                        gle field when querying for scan entries.

                     GreaterThan -> (long)
                        Represents a greater than condition to be applied to a
                        single field when querying for scan entries.

                     LessThan -> (long)
                        Represents  a  less  than condition to be applied to a
                        single field when querying for scan entries.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilterCriterion": [
              {
                "CriterionKey": "EC2_INSTANCE_ARN"|"SCAN_ID"|"ACCOUNT_ID"|"GUARDDUTY_FINDING_ID"|"SCAN_START_TIME"|"SCAN_STATUS",
                "FilterCondition": {
                  "EqualsValue": "string",
                  "GreaterThan": long,
                  "LessThan": long
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used for sorting scan entries.

          AttributeName -> (string)
              Represents the finding attribute  (for  example,  accountId)  to
              sort findings by.

          OrderBy -> (string)
              The order by which the sorted findings are to be displayed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,OrderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AttributeName": "string",
            "OrderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
