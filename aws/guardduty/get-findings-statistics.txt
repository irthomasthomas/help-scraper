GET-FINDINGS-STATISTICS()                            GET-FINDINGS-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-findings-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists GuardDuty findings statistics for the specified detector ID.

       You must provide either findingStatisticTypes or groupBy parameter, and
       not both. You can use the maxResults and orderBy parameters  only  when
       using groupBy .

       There  might  be  regional  differences because some flags might not be
       available in all the Regions where GuardDuty  is  currently  supported.
       For more information, see Regions and endpoints .

          Displays the sorted findings in the  requested  order.  The  default
          value of orderBy is DESC .

          You can use this parameter only with the groupBy parameter.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
