NAME
       update-organization-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures  the  delegated administrator account with the provided val-
       ues. You must provide a value for either  autoEnableOrganizationMembers
       or autoEnable , but not both.

       Specifying  both  EKS  Runtime Monitoring (EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING ) and
       Runtime Monitoring (RUNTIME_MONITORING ) will cause an error.  You  can
       add  only  one of these two features because Runtime Monitoring already
       includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources. For more infor-
       mation, see Runtime Monitoring .

       There might be regional differences because some data sources might not
       be available in all the Amazon Web Services Regions where GuardDuty  is
       presently supported. For more information, see Regions and endpoints .

          member accounts in the organization. You must provide  a  value  for
          either autoEnableOrganizationMembers or autoEnable .

          Use  one of the following configuration values for autoEnableOrgani-
          zationMembers :

            they will have GuardDuty enabled automatically.

            moved from the organization in GuardDuty. It may  take  up  to  24
            hours to update the configuration for all the member accounts.

          o NONE  : Indicates that GuardDuty will not be automatically enabled
            for any account in the organization. The administrator must manage
            GuardDuty  for each account in the organization individually. When
            you update the auto-enable setting from ALL or NEW to NONE ,  this
            action  doesn't disable the corresponding option for your existing
            accounts. This configuration will apply to the new  accounts  that
            join  the organization. After you update the auto-enable settings,
            no new account will have the corresponding option as enabled.

          o ALL

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
