DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERS()                                  DISASSOCIATE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       disassociate-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates GuardDuty member accounts (from the current administrator
       account) specified by the account IDs.

       When you disassociate an invited member from a GuardDuty delegated  ad-
       ministrator, the member account details obtained from the CreateMembers
       API, including the associated email addresses, are  retained.  This  is
       done  so  that the delegated administrator can invoke the InviteMembers
       API without the need to invoke the CreateMembers API again.  To  remove
       the details associated with a member account, the delegated administra-
       tor must invoke the DeleteMembers API.

       With autoEnableOrganizationMembers configuration for your  organization
       set  to  ALL , you'll receive an error if you attempt to disassociate a
       member account before removing them from your organization.

       If you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation,  the
       member account details obtained from this API, including the associated
       email addresses, will be retained. This is done so that  the  delegated
       administrator  can invoke the InviteMembers API without the need to in-
       voke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with
       a   member   account,  the  delegated  administrator  must  invoke  the
       DeleteMembers API.

       When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disasso-
       ciated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMem-
       bers API. You can create an  association  with  these  member  accounts
       again only by calling the CreateMembers API.

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account whose members
          you want to disassociate from the administrator account.

       --account-ids (list)
          A list of account IDs of the GuardDuty member accounts that you want
          to disassociate from the administrator account.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       UnprocessedAccounts -> (list)

          string that explains why it was unprocessed.
