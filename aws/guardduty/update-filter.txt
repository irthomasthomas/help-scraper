       Shorthand Syntax:

          Criterion={KeyName1={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long},KeyName2={Eq=[string,string],Neq=[string,string],Gt=integer,Gte=integer,Lt=integer,Lte=integer,Equals=[string,string],NotEquals=[string,string],GreaterThan=long,GreaterThanOrEqual=long,LessThan=long,LessThanOrEqual=long}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Criterion": {"string": {
                  "Eq": ["string", ...],
                  "Neq": ["string", ...],
                  "Gt": integer,
                  "Gte": integer,
                  "Lt": integer,
                  "Lte": integer,
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],

                }
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
