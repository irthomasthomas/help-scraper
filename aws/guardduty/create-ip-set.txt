CREATE-IP-SET()                                                CREATE-IP-SET()



NAME
       create-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new IPSet, which is called a trusted IP list in the console
       user interface. An IPSet is a list of IP addresses that are trusted for
       secure communication with Amazon Web Services infrastructure and appli-
       cations. GuardDuty doesn't generate findings for IP addresses that  are
       included  in  IPSets. Only users from the administrator account can use
       this operation.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-ip-set
          --detector-id <value>
          --name <value>
          --format <value>
          --location <value>
          --activate | --no-activate
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account that you want
          to create an IPSet for.

       --name (string)
          The user-friendly name to identify the IPSet.

          Allowed  characters  are alphanumerics, spaces, hyphens (-), and un-
          derscores (_).

       --format (string)
          The format of the file that contains the IPSet.

          Possible values:

          o TXT

          o STIX

          o OTX_CSV

          o ALIEN_VAULT

          o PROOF_POINT

          o FIRE_EYE

       --location (string)
          The URI of the file that contains the IPSet.

       --activate | --no-activate (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether GuardDuty is to  start  using
          the uploaded IPSet.

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for the create request.

       --tags (map)
          The tags to be added to a new IP set resource.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a trusted IP set

       The  following create-ip-set example creates and activates a trusted IP
       set in the current region.

          aws guardduty create-ip-set \
              --detector-id 12abc34d567e8fa901bc2d34eexample \
              --name new-ip-set \
              --format TXT
              --location s3://AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/customtrustlist.csv
              --activate

       Output:

          {
              "IpSetId": "d4b94fc952d6912b8f3060768example"
          }

       For more information, see Working with  Trusted  IP  Lists  and  Threat
       Lists in the GuardDuty User Guide.

OUTPUT
       IpSetId -> (string)
          The ID of the IPSet resource.
