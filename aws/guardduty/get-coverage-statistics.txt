       Duty administrator, you can retrieve the statistics  for  all  the  re-
       sources associated with the active member accounts in your organization
       who have enabled EKS Runtime Monitoring and have  the  GuardDuty  agent
       running on their EKS nodes.

          statistics.

       --filter-criteria (structure)
          Represents the criteria used to filter the coverage statistics

          FilterCriterion -> (list)
              Represents a condition that when matched will be  added  to  the
              response of the operation.

              (structure)
                 Represents a condition that when matched will be added to the

                 CriterionKey -> (string)
                     An enum value representing possible filter fields.

                 FilterCondition -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the condition.

                     Equals -> (list)
                        Represents an equal condition that  is  applied  to  a
                        single field while retrieving the coverage details.

                        (string)

                     NotEquals -> (list)
                        Represents  a not equal condition that is applied to a
                        single field while retrieving the coverage details.

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilterCriterion": [
              {
                "CriterionKey": "ACCOUNT_ID"|"CLUSTER_NAME"|"RESOURCE_TYPE"|"COVERAGE_STATUS"|"ADDON_VERSION"|"MANAGEMENT_TYPE",
                "FilterCondition": {
                  "Equals": ["string", ...],
                  "NotEquals": ["string", ...]
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --statistics-type (list)
          Represents the statistics type used to aggregate  the  coverage  de-
          tails.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COUNT_BY_RESOURCE_TYPE
            COUNT_BY_COVERAGE_STATUS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT

          Represents the count aggregated by the statusCode and resourceType .

          CountByResourceType -> (map)
              Represents coverage statistics for EKS  clusters  aggregated  by
              resource type.
