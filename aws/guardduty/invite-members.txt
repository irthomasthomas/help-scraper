INVITE-MEMBERS()                                              INVITE-MEMBERS()



NAME
       invite-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Invites  Amazon Web Services accounts to become members of an organiza-
       tion administered by the Amazon Web Services account that invokes  this
       API.  If you are using Amazon Web Services Organizations to manage your
       GuardDuty environment, this step is not needed. For  more  information,
       see Managing accounts with organizations .

       To  invite  Amazon  Web  Services accounts, the first step is to ensure
       that GuardDuty has been enabled in the potential member  accounts.  You
       can  now invoke this API to add accounts by invitation. The invited ac-
       counts can either accept or decline the invitation from their GuardDuty
       accounts. Each invited Amazon Web Services account can choose to accept
       the invitation from only one Amazon Web Services account. For more  in-
       formation, see Managing GuardDuty accounts by invitation .

       After  the  invite  has  been accepted and you choose to disassociate a
       member account (by using DisassociateMembers ) from your  account,  the
       details  of the member account obtained by invoking CreateMembers , in-
       cluding the associated email addresses, will be retained. This is  done
       so  that  you  can  invoke  InviteMembers  without  the  need to invoke
       CreateMembers again. To remove the details associated with a member ac-
       count, you must also invoke DeleteMembers .

       If  you disassociate a member account that was added by invitation, the
       member account details obtained from this API, including the associated
       email  addresses,  will be retained. This is done so that the delegated
       administrator can invoke the InviteMembers API without the need to  in-
       voke the CreateMembers API again. To remove the details associated with
       a  member  account,  the  delegated  administrator  must   invoke   the
       DeleteMembers API.

       When the member accounts added through Organizations are later disasso-
       ciated, you (administrator) can't invite them by calling the InviteMem-
       bers  API.  You  can  create  an association with these member accounts
       again only by calling the CreateMembers API.

OPTIONS
       --detector-id (string)
          The unique ID of the detector of the GuardDuty account that you want
          to invite members with.

       --account-ids (list)
          A  list  of  account  IDs of the accounts that you want to invite to
          GuardDuty as members.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --disable-email-notification |  --no-disable-email-notification  (bool-
       ean)
          A Boolean value that specifies whether you want to disable email no-
          tification to the accounts that you are  inviting  to  GuardDuty  as
          members.

       --message (string)
          The  invitation  message  that you want to send to the accounts that
          you're inviting to GuardDuty as members.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
