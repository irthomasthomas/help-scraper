NAME
       get-notification-event -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a specified NotificationEvent.

       WARNING:
          User  Notifications  stores  notifications in the individual Regions
          you register as notification hubs and the Region of the source event
          rule.  GetNotificationEvent only returns notifications stored in the
          same Region in  which  the  action  is  called.  User  Notifications
          doesn't  backfill notifications to new Regions selected as notifica-
          tion hubs. For this reason, we recommend that you make calls in your
          oldest  registered  notification  hub.  For  more  information,  see
          Notification hubs in the AWS User Notifications User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
