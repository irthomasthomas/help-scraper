OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Macie resource that the request
          applies to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the allow list.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the al-
          low list was created in Amazon Macie.

       criteria -> (structure)
          The criteria that specify the text or text pattern  to  ignore.  The
          criteria  can  be  the  location and name of an S3 object that lists
          specific text to  ignore  (s3WordsList),  or  a  regular  expression
          (regex) that defines a text pattern to ignore.

          regex -> (string)
              The regular expression (regex ) that defines the text pattern to
              ignore. The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

          s3WordsList -> (structure)
              The location and name of the S3 object that lists specific  text
              to ignore.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The full name of the S3 bucket that contains the object.

              objectKey -> (string)
                 The full name (key) of the object.

       description -> (string)
          The custom description of the allow list.

       id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the allow list.

       name -> (string)
          The custom name of the allow list.

       status -> (structure)
          The current status of the allow list, which indicates whether Amazon
          Macie can access and use the list's criteria.

          code -> (string)
              The current status of the allow list.  If  the  list's  criteria
              specify  a  regular  expression (regex), this value is typically
              OK. Amazon Macie can compile the expression.

              If the list's criteria specify an  S3  object,  possible  values
              are:

              o OK - Macie can retrieve and parse the contents of the object.

              o S3_OBJECT_ACCESS_DENIED  -  Macie  isn't allowed to access the
                object or the object is encrypted with a customer managed  KMS
                key  that  Macie isn't allowed to use. Check the bucket policy
                and other permissions settings for the bucket and the  object.
                If  the  object  is encrypted, also ensure that it's encrypted
                with a key that Macie is allowed to use.

              o S3_OBJECT_EMPTY - Macie can retrieve the object but the object
                doesn't  contain  any content. Ensure that the object contains
                the correct entries. Also  ensure  that  the  list's  criteria
                specify the correct bucket and object names.

              o S3_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND  -  The object doesn't exist in Amazon S3.
                Ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and
                object names.

              o S3_OBJECT_OVERSIZE  -  Macie can retrieve the object. However,
                the object contains too many entries or its storage  size  ex-
                ceeds  the quota for an allow list. Try breaking the list into
                multiple files and ensure that each file  doesn't  exceed  any
                quotas. Then configure list settings in Macie for each file.

              o S3_THROTTLED - Amazon S3 throttled the request to retrieve the
                object. Wait a few minutes and then try again.

              o S3_USER_ACCESS_DENIED - Amazon S3 denied the  request  to  re-
                trieve  the object. If the specified object exists, you're not
                allowed to access it or it's encrypted with an  KMS  key  that
                you're  not allowed to use. Work with your Amazon Web Services
                administrator to ensure that the list's criteria  specify  the
                correct  bucket  and object names, and you have read access to
                the bucket and the object. If the object  is  encrypted,  also
                ensure  that  it's encrypted with a key that you're allowed to
                use.

              o UNKNOWN_ERROR - A transient or internal  error  occurred  when
                Macie  attempted  to  retrieve or parse the object. Wait a few
                minutes and then try again. A list can also have  this  status
                if  it's  encrypted  with a key that Amazon S3 and Macie can't
                access or use.

          description -> (string)
              A brief description of the status of the allow list. Amazon  Ma-
              cie  uses  this value to provide additional information about an
              error that occurred when Macie  tried  to  access  and  use  the
              list's criteria.

       tags -> (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies which tags (keys and values)
          are associated with the allow list.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       updatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the al-
          low list's settings were most recently changed in Amazon Macie.
