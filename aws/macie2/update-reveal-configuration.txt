OPTIONS
       --configuration (structure)
          The KMS key to use to encrypt the sensitive data, and the status  of
          the configuration for the Amazon Macie account.

          kmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN), ID, or alias of the KMS key to
              use to encrypt sensitive data that's retrieved. The key must  be
              an  existing,  customer managed, symmetric encryption key that's
              enabled in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Ma-
              cie account.

              If  this value specifies an alias, it must include the following
              prefix: alias/. If this value specifies a key  that's  owned  by
              another  Amazon Web Services account, it must specify the ARN of
              the key or the ARN of the key's alias.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the configuration for the Amazon Macie account. In
              a  request,  valid values are: ENABLED, enable the configuration
              for the account; and, DISABLED, disable  the  configuration  for
              the  account.  In  a response, possible values are: ENABLED, the
              configuration is currently enabled for the  account;  and,  DIS-
              ABLED, the configuration is currently disabled for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyId=string,status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyId": "string",
            "status": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --retrieval-configuration (structure)
          The  access  method  and  settings  to use to retrieve the sensitive
          data.

          retrievalMode -> (string)
              The access method to use when retrieving sensitive data from af-
              fected  S3 objects. Valid values are: ASSUME_ROLE, assume an IAM
              role that is in the affected Amazon  Web  Services  account  and
              delegates  access  to Amazon Macie; and, CALLER_CREDENTIALS, use
              the credentials of the IAM user who requests the sensitive data.
              If you specify ASSUME_ROLE, also specify the name of an existing
              IAM role for Macie to assume (roleName).

              WARNING:
                 If you change this value from ASSUME_ROLE  to  CALLER_CREDEN-
                 TIALS   for  an  existing  configuration,  Macie  permanently
                 deletes the external ID and role name currently specified for
                 the  configuration.  These  settings can't be recovered after
                 they're deleted.

          roleName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM role that is in the affected Amazon Web Ser-
              vices  account  and  Amazon  Macie is allowed to assume when re-
              trieving sensitive data from affected S3  objects  for  the  ac-
              count. The trust and permissions policies for the role must meet
              all requirements for Macie to assume the role.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          retrievalMode=string,roleName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "retrievalMode": "CALLER_CREDENTIALS"|"ASSUME_ROLE",
            "roleName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       configuration -> (structure)
          The  KMS key to use to encrypt the sensitive data, and the status of
          the configuration for the Amazon Macie account.

          kmsKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN), ID, or alias of the KMS  key  to
              use  to encrypt sensitive data that's retrieved. The key must be
              an existing, customer managed, symmetric encryption  key  that's
              enabled in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Ma-
              cie account.

              If this value specifies an alias, it must include the  following
              prefix:  alias/.  If  this value specifies a key that's owned by
              another Amazon Web Services account, it must specify the ARN  of
              the key or the ARN of the key's alias.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the configuration for the Amazon Macie account. In
              a request, valid values are: ENABLED, enable  the  configuration
              for  the  account;  and, DISABLED, disable the configuration for
              the account. In a response, possible values  are:  ENABLED,  the
              configuration  is  currently  enabled for the account; and, DIS-
              ABLED, the configuration is currently disabled for the account.

       retrievalConfiguration -> (structure)
          The access method and settings to  use  to  retrieve  the  sensitive
          data.

          externalId -> (string)
              The  external ID to specify in the trust policy for the IAM role
              to assume when retrieving sensitive data from  affected  S3  ob-
              jects  (roleName).  The  trust policy must include an sts:Exter-
              nalId condition that requires this ID.

              This ID is a unique alphanumeric string that Amazon Macie gener-
              ates automatically after you configure it to assume a role. This
              value is null if the value for retrievalMode  is  CALLER_CREDEN-
              TIALS.

          retrievalMode -> (string)
              The  access  method  that's  used when retrieving sensitive data
              from affected S3 objects. Valid values are: ASSUME_ROLE,  assume
              an  IAM role that is in the affected Amazon Web Services account
              and  delegates  access  to   Amazon   Macie   (roleName);   and,
              CALLER_CREDENTIALS,  use the credentials of the IAM user who re-
              quests the sensitive data.

          roleName -> (string)
              The name of the IAM role that is in the affected Amazon Web Ser-
              vices  account  and  Amazon  Macie is allowed to assume when re-
              trieving sensitive data from affected S3  objects  for  the  ac-
              count.  This  value  is  null  if the value for retrievalMode is
              CALLER_CREDENTIALS.
