       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-reveal-configuration
          --configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration (structure)
          The new configuration settings and the status of  the  configuration
          for the account.

          kmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN), ID, or alias of the KMS key to
              use to encrypt sensitive data that's retrieved. The key must  be
              an  existing,  customer managed, symmetric encryption key that's
              in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon  Macie  ac-
              count.

              If  this value specifies an alias, it must include the following
              prefix: alias/. If this value specifies a key  that's  owned  by
              another  Amazon Web Services account, it must specify the ARN of
              the key or the ARN of the key's alias.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the configuration for the Amazon Macie account. In
              a  request,  valid values are: ENABLED, enable the configuration
              for the account; and, DISABLED, disable  the  configuration  for
              the  account.  In  a response, possible values are: ENABLED, the
              configuration is currently enabled for the  account;  and,  DIS-
              ABLED, the configuration is currently disabled for the account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kmsKeyId=string,status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "kmsKeyId": "string",
            "status": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
