OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       autoEnableOrganizationMembers -> (string)
          Specifies whether automated sensitive data discovery is enabled  au-
          tomatically  for  accounts in the organization. Possible values are:
          ALL, enable it for all existing accounts and  new  member  accounts;
          NEW, enable it only for new member accounts; and, NONE, don't enable
          it for any accounts.

       classificationScopeId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the classification scope that's used  when
          performing  automated  sensitive  data discovery. The classification
          scope specifies S3 buckets to exclude from analyses.

       disabledAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when  auto-
          mated  sensitive  data  discovery  was  most recently disabled. This
          value is null if automated sensitive data discovery is currently en-
          abled.

       firstEnabledAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when auto-
          mated sensitive data discovery was initially enabled. This value  is
          null if automated sensitive data discovery has never been enabled.

       lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time,  in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the
          configuration settings or status of automated sensitive data discov-
          ery was most recently changed.

       sensitivityInspectionTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the sensitivity inspection template that's
          used when performing automated sensitive data  discovery.  The  tem-
          plate specifies which allow lists, custom data identifiers, and man-
          aged data identifiers to use when analyzing data.

       status -> (string)
          The current status of automated sensitive data discovery for the or-
          ganization  or account. Possible values are: ENABLED, use the speci-
          fied settings to perform automated sensitive data discovery  activi-
          ties;  and, DISABLED, don't perform automated sensitive data discov-
          ery activities.
