OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       classificationScopeId -> (string)
          The  unique identifier for the classification scope that's used when
          performing automated sensitive data discovery for the  account.  The
          classification  scope specifies S3 buckets to exclude from automated
          sensitive data discovery.

       disabledAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when  auto-
          mated  sensitive  data  discovery was most recently disabled for the
          account. This value is null if automated  sensitive  data  discovery
          wasn't enabled and subsequently disabled for the account.

       firstEnabledAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when auto-
          mated sensitive data discovery was initially  enabled  for  the  ac-
          count.  This value is null if automated sensitive data discovery has
          never been enabled for the account.

       lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when  auto-
          mated sensitive data discovery was most recently enabled or disabled
          for the account.

       sensitivityInspectionTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the sensitivity inspection template that's
          used  when performing automated sensitive data discovery for the ac-
          count. The template specifies which allow lists, custom data identi-
          fiers, and managed data identifiers to use when analyzing data.

       status -> (string)
          The current status of the automated sensitive data discovery config-
          uration for the account. Possible values are: ENABLED, use the spec-
          ified settings to perform automated sensitive data discovery activi-
          ties for the account; and, DISABLED, don't perform automated  sensi-
          tive data discovery activities for the account.
