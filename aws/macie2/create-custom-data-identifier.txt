OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive token that you provide to ensure the  idem-
          potency of the request.

       --description (string)
          A  custom description of the custom data identifier. The description
          can contain as many as 512 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the description of a custom data identifier. Other users of your ac-
          count might be able to see this description, depending  on  the  ac-
          tions that they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.

       --ignore-words (list)
          An  array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words ) to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The
          array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore  word  can
          contain 4-90 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --keywords (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must precede and be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of
          the regular expression to match. The array can contain as many as 50
          keywords. Each keyword can contain 3-90 UTF-8  characters.  Keywords
          aren't case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maximum-match-distance (integer)
          The  maximum  number of characters that can exist between the end of
          at least one complete character sequence specified by  the  keywords
          array  and  the end of the text that matches the regex pattern. If a
          complete keyword precedes all the text that matches the pattern  and
          the  keyword is within the specified distance, Amazon Macie includes
          the result. The distance can be 1-300 characters. The default  value
          is 50.

       --name (string)
          A  custom  name for the custom data identifier. The name can contain
          as many as 128 characters.

          We strongly recommend that you avoid including any sensitive data in
          the  name  of  a custom data identifier. Other users of your account
          might be able to see  this  name,  depending  on  the  actions  that
          they're allowed to perform in Amazon Macie.

       --regex (string)
          The  regular  expression (regex ) that defines the pattern to match.
          The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

       --severity-levels (list)
          The severity to assign to findings that the custom  data  identifier
          produces,  based  on  the number of occurrences of text that matches
          the custom data identifier's detection criteria. You can specify  as
          many  as  three  SeverityLevel  objects  in this array, one for each
          severity: LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you specify more  than  one,  the
          occurrences  thresholds must be in ascending order by severity, mov-
          ing from LOW to HIGH. For example, 1 for LOW, 50 for MEDIUM, and 100
          for HIGH. If an S3 object contains fewer occurrences than the lowest
          specified threshold, Amazon Macie doesn't create a finding.

          If you don't specify any values for this array, Macie creates  find-
          ings  for  S3  objects  that contain at least one occurrence of text
          that matches the detection criteria, and Macie  assigns  the  MEDIUM
          severity to those findings.

          (structure)
              Specifies a severity level for findings that a custom data iden-
              tifier produces. A severity level determines which  severity  is
              assigned  to the findings, based on the number of occurrences of
              text that matches the custom data identifier's detection  crite-
              ria.

              occurrencesThreshold -> (long)
                 The minimum number of occurrences of text that must match the
                 custom data identifier's detection criteria in order to  pro-
                 duce a finding with the specified severity (severity).

              severity -> (string)
                 The  severity to assign to a finding: if the number of occur-
                 rences is greater than or equal to  the  specified  threshold
                 (occurrencesThreshold); and, if applicable, the number of oc-
                 currences is less than the threshold for the next consecutive
                 severity  level  for  the custom data identifier, moving from
                 LOW to HIGH.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          occurrencesThreshold=long,severity=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "occurrencesThreshold": long,
              "severity": "LOW"|"MEDIUM"|"HIGH"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          A map of key-value pairs that specifies the tags to  associate  with
          the custom data identifier.

          A  custom  data  identifier  can have a maximum of 50 tags. Each tag
          consists of a tag key and  an  associated  tag  value.  The  maximum
          length  of  a tag key is 128 characters. The maximum length of a tag
          value is 256 characters.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
