OPTIONS
       --ignore-words (list)
          An  array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words ) to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The
          array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore  word  can
          contain 4-90 UTF-8 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --keywords (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must precede and be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of
          the regular expression to match. The array can contain as many as 50
          keywords. Each keyword can contain 3-90 UTF-8  characters.  Keywords
          aren't case sensitive.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maximum-match-distance (integer)
          The  maximum  number of characters that can exist between the end of
          at least one complete character sequence specified by  the  keywords
          array  and  the end of the text that matches the regex pattern. If a
          complete keyword precedes all the text that matches the pattern  and
          the  keyword is within the specified distance, Amazon Macie includes
          the result. The distance can be 1-300 characters. The default  value
          is 50.

       --regex (string)
          The  regular  expression (regex ) that defines the pattern to match.
          The expression can contain as many as 512 characters.

       --sample-text (string)
          The sample text to inspect by using the custom data identifier.  The
          text can contain as many as 1,000 characters.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       matchCount -> (integer)
          The number of occurrences of sample text that matched  the  criteria
          specified by the custom data identifier.
