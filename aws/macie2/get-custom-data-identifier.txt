OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Macie resource that the request
          applies to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom data identifier.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time,  in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the
          custom data identifier was created.

       deleted -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether the custom data identifier  was  deleted.  If  you
          delete a custom data identifier, Amazon Macie doesn't delete it per-
          manently. Instead, it soft deletes the identifier.

       description -> (string)
          The custom description of the custom data identifier.

       id -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the custom data identifier.

       ignoreWords -> (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words )  to
          exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expres-
          sion contains any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. Ig-
          nore words are case sensitive.

          (string)

       keywords -> (list)
          An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords ), one of
          which must precede and be within proximity (maximumMatchDistance) of
          the regular expression to match. Keywords aren't case sensitive.

          (string)

       maximumMatchDistance -> (integer)
          The  maximum  number of characters that can exist between the end of
          at least one complete character sequence specified by  the  keywords
          array  and  the end of the text that matches the regex pattern. If a
          complete keyword precedes all the text that matches the pattern  and
          the  keyword is within the specified distance, Amazon Macie includes
          the result. Otherwise, Macie excludes the result.

       name -> (string)
          The custom name of the custom data identifier.

       regex -> (string)
          The regular expression (regex ) that defines the pattern to match.

       severityLevels -> (list)
          Specifies the severity that's assigned to findings that  the  custom
          data identifier produces, based on the number of occurrences of text
          that match the custom data identifier's detection criteria.  By  de-
          fault,  Amazon Macie creates findings for S3 objects that contain at
          least one occurrence of text that matches  the  detection  criteria,
          and Macie assigns the MEDIUM severity to those findings.

          (structure)
              Specifies a severity level for findings that a custom data iden-
              tifier produces. A severity level determines which  severity  is
              assigned  to the findings, based on the number of occurrences of
              text that match the custom data identifier's detection criteria.

              occurrencesThreshold -> (long)
                 The minimum number of occurrences of text that must match the
                 custom  data identifier's detection criteria in order to pro-
                 duce a finding with the specified severity (severity).

              severity -> (string)
                 The severity to assign to a finding: if the number of  occur-
                 rences  is  greater  than or equal to the specified threshold
                 (occurrencesThreshold); and, if applicable, the number of oc-
                 currences is less than the threshold for the next consecutive
                 severity level for the custom data  identifier,  moving  from
                 LOW to HIGH.

       tags -> (map)
          A  map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags (keys and values)
          that are associated with the custom data identifier.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
