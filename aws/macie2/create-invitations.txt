OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          An  array  that  lists Amazon Web Services account IDs, one for each
          account to send the invitation to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --disable-email-notification |  --no-disable-email-notification  (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies  whether  to  send  the invitation as an email message. If
          this value is false, Amazon Macie sends the invitation (as an  email
          message) to the email address that you specified for the recipient's
          account when you associated the account with your account.  The  de-
          fault value is false.

       --message (string)
          Custom  text to include in the email message that contains the invi-
          tation. The text can contain as many as 80 alphanumeric characters.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
