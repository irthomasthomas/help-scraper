OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string that specifies which page of results to  return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each managed data identifier.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a managed data identifier. For  addi-
              tional  information,  see  Using managed data identifiers in the
              Amazon Macie User Guide .

              category -> (string)
                 The category of sensitive data that the managed data  identi-
                 fier  detects: CREDENTIALS, for credentials data such as pri-
                 vate keys or Amazon Web Services secret access  keys;  FINAN-
                 CIAL_INFORMATION, for financial data such as credit card num-
                 bers; or, PERSONAL_INFORMATION, for personal health  informa-
                 tion,  such  as  health  insurance identification numbers, or
                 personally identifiable information, such  as  passport  num-
                 bers.

              id -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier for the managed data identifier. This
                 is a string that describes the type of  sensitive  data  that
                 the   managed   data   identifier   detects.   For   example:
                 OPENSSH_PRIVATE_KEY     for     OpenSSH     private     keys,
                 CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER  for  credit  card  numbers,  or USA_PASS-
                 PORT_NUMBER for US passport numbers.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The string to use in a subsequent request to get the  next  page  of
          results  in a paginated response. This value is null if there are no
          additional pages.
