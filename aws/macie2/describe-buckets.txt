DESCRIBE-BUCKETS()                                          DESCRIBE-BUCKETS()



NAME
       describe-buckets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves (queries) statistical data and other information about one or
       more S3 buckets that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for an account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-buckets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: buckets

OPTIONS
       --criteria (map)
          The criteria to use to filter the query results.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Specifies the operator to use in a property-based condition that
              filters the results of a query for information about S3 buckets.

              eq -> (list)
                 The value for the property  matches  (equals)  the  specified
                 value.  If  you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie uses OR
                 logic to join the values.

                 (string)

              gt -> (long)
                 The value for the property  is  greater  than  the  specified
                 value.

              gte -> (long)
                 The  value  for  the property is greater than or equal to the
                 specified value.

              lt -> (long)
                 The value for the property is less than the specified value.

              lte -> (long)
                 The value for the property is less than or equal to the spec-
                 ified value.

              neq -> (list)
                 The  value for the property doesn't match (doesn't equal) the
                 specified value. If you specify multiple values, Amazon Macie
                 uses OR logic to join the values.

                 (string)

              prefix -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket begins with the specified value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=eq=string,string,gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=string,string,prefix=string,KeyName2=eq=string,string,gt=long,gte=long,lt=long,lte=long,neq=string,string,prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "eq": ["string", ...],
                "gt": long,
                "gte": long,
                "lt": long,
                "lte": long,
                "neq": ["string", ...],
                "prefix": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the query results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  bucket property to sort the results by. This
              value can be one of the following properties that  Amazon  Macie
              defines  as  bucket  metadata:  accountId, bucketName, classifi-
              ableObjectCount, classifiableSizeInBytes, objectCount, sensitiv-
              ityScore, or sizeInBytes.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the value spec-
              ified by the attributeName property. Valid values are: ASC, sort
              the  results  in ascending order; and, DESC, sort the results in
              descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "string",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  query  data about one or more S3 buckets that Amazon Macie monitors
       and analyzes for your account

       The following describe-buckets example  queries  metadata  for  all  S3
       buckets whose names begin with MY-S3 and are in the current AWS Region.

          aws macie2 describe-buckets \
              --criteria '{"bucketName":{"prefix":"my-S3"}}'

OUTPUT
       buckets -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each bucket  that  matches  the  filter
          criteria specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides  statistical  data  and  other  information about an S3
              bucket that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for your account.
              By  default,  object  count and storage size values include data
              for object parts that are the result of incomplete multipart up-
              loads.  For  more  information, see How Macie monitors Amazon S3
              data security in the Amazon Macie User Guide .

              If an error occurs when Macie attempts to retrieve  and  process
              metadata  from Amazon S3 for the bucket or the bucket's objects,
              the value for the versioning property is false and the value for
              most  other  properties  is  null. Key exceptions are accountId,
              bucketArn, bucketCreatedAt, bucketName, lastUpdated, and region.
              To  identify  the cause of the error, refer to the errorCode and
              errorMessage values.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier for the  Amazon  Web  Services  account
                 that owns the bucket.

              allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the bucket policy for the bucket requires
                 server-side encryption of objects when objects are  added  to
                 the bucket. Possible values are:

                 o FALSE  -  The bucket policy requires server-side encryption
                   of new objects. PutObject requests  must  include  a  valid
                   server-side encryption header.

                 o TRUE  - The bucket doesn't have a bucket policy or it has a
                   bucket policy that doesn't require  server-side  encryption
                   of  new  objects. If a bucket policy exists, it doesn't re-
                   quire PutObject requests to include a valid server-side en-
                   cryption header.

                 o UNKNOWN  -  Amazon Macie can't determine whether the bucket
                   policy requires server-side encryption of new objects.

                 Valid      server-side      encryption      headers      are:
                 x-amz-server-side-encryption   with  a  value  of  AES256  or
                 aws:kms, and  x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm
                 with a value of AES256.

              automatedDiscoveryMonitoringStatus -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether automated sensitive data discovery is cur-
                 rently configured to analyze objects in the bucket.  Possible
                 values  are:  MONITORED,  the bucket is included in analyses;
                 and, NOT_MONITORED, the bucket is excluded from analyses.  If
                 automated  sensitive  data discovery is disabled for your ac-
                 count, this value is NOT_MONITORED.

              bucketArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.

              bucketCreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when
                 the  bucket  was  created.  This value can also indicate when
                 changes such as edits to the bucket's policy  were  most  re-
                 cently made to the bucket.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the bucket.

              classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
                 The  total number of objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in
                 the bucket. These objects use a supported storage  class  and
                 have  a  file  name extension for a supported file or storage
                 format.

              classifiableSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that  Amazon
                 Macie  can  analyze  in  the bucket. These objects use a sup-
                 ported storage class and have a file  name  extension  for  a
                 supported file or storage format.

                 If  versioning  is  enabled  for the bucket, Macie calculates
                 this value based on the size of the latest  version  of  each
                 applicable  object  in the bucket. This value doesn't reflect
                 the storage size of all versions of each applicable object in
                 the bucket.

              errorCode -> (string)
                 The  error code for an error that prevented Amazon Macie from
                 retrieving and processing information about  the  bucket  and
                 the  bucket's  objects. If this value is ACCESS_DENIED, Macie
                 doesn't have permission to retrieve the information. For  ex-
                 ample,  the bucket has a restrictive bucket policy and Amazon
                 S3 denied the request. If this value is null, Macie was  able
                 to retrieve and process the information.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 A  brief  description of the error (errorCode) that prevented
                 Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing information about
                 the  bucket  and  the bucket's objects. This value is null if
                 Macie was able to retrieve and process the information.

              jobDetails -> (structure)
                 Specifies whether any one-time  or  recurring  classification
                 jobs are configured to analyze objects in the bucket, and, if
                 so, the details of the job that ran most recently.

                 isDefinedInJob -> (string)
                     Specifies whether any one-time or recurring jobs are con-
                     figured to analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values
                     are:

                     o TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the  bucket
                       definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for one or more
                       jobs and at least one of those jobs has a status  other
                       than CANCELLED. Or the bucket matched the bucket crite-
                       ria (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for at least one job  that
                       previously ran.

                     o FALSE  -  The  bucket  isn't explicitly included in the
                       bucket definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for  any
                       jobs,  all  the jobs that explicitly include the bucket
                       in their bucket definitions have a status of CANCELLED,
                       or the bucket didn't match the bucket criteria (S3Buck-
                       etCriteriaForJob) for any jobs that previously ran.

                     o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon  Macie  at-
                       tempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                 isMonitoredByJob -> (string)
                     Specifies  whether  any  recurring jobs are configured to
                     analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values are:

                     o TRUE - The bucket is explicitly included in the  bucket
                       definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for one or more
                       recurring jobs or the bucket matches the bucket  crite-
                       ria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob) for one or more recurring
                       jobs. At least one of those jobs  has  a  status  other
                       than CANCELLED.

                     o FALSE  -  The  bucket  isn't explicitly included in the
                       bucket definition  (S3BucketDefinitionForJob)  for  any
                       recurring  jobs,  the  bucket  doesn't match the bucket
                       criteria  (S3BucketCriteriaForJob)  for  any  recurring
                       jobs,  or all the recurring jobs that are configured to
                       analyze data in the bucket have a status of CANCELLED.

                     o UNKNOWN - An exception occurred when Amazon  Macie  at-
                       tempted to retrieve job data for the bucket.

                 lastJobId -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the job that ran most recently
                     and is configured to analyze objects in the  bucket,  ei-
                     ther the latest run of a recurring job or the only run of
                     a one-time job.

                     This value is typically null if the value for  the  isDe-
                     finedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

                 lastJobRunTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
                     when the job (lastJobId) started. If the job is a  recur-
                     ring  job,  this value indicates when the most recent run
                     started.

                     This value is typically null if the value for  the  isDe-
                     finedInJob property is FALSE or UNKNOWN.

              lastAutomatedDiscoveryTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when
                 Amazon Macie most recently analyzed  objects  in  the  bucket
                 while  performing  automated  sensitive  data discovery. This
                 value is null if automated sensitive data discovery  is  dis-
                 abled for your account.

              lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when
                 Amazon Macie most recently retrieved bucket or  object  meta-
                 data from Amazon S3 for the bucket.

              objectCount -> (long)
                 The total number of objects in the bucket.

              objectCountByEncryptionType -> (structure)
                 The  total  number  of  objects  in  the  bucket,  grouped by
                 server-side encryption type. This includes  a  grouping  that
                 reports  the total number of objects that aren't encrypted or
                 use client-side encryption.

                 customerManaged -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that are encrypted with  cus-
                     tomer-provided  keys. The objects use server-side encryp-
                     tion with customer-provided keys (SSE-C).

                 kmsManaged -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that are encrypted  with  KMS
                     keys, either Amazon Web Services managed keys or customer
                     managed keys. The objects use dual-layer server-side  en-
                     cryption   or   server-side   encryption  with  KMS  keys
                     (DSSE-KMS or SSE-KMS).

                 s3Managed -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that are encrypted with  Ama-
                     zon  S3 managed keys. The objects use server-side encryp-
                     tion with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

                 unencrypted -> (long)
                     The total number of objects that use client-side  encryp-
                     tion or aren't encrypted.

                 unknown -> (long)
                     The  total  number  of  objects that Amazon Macie doesn't
                     have current encryption metadata for. Macie can't provide
                     current  data about the encryption settings for these ob-
                     jects.

              publicAccess -> (structure)
                 Specifies whether the bucket is publicly  accessible  due  to
                 the  combination  of  permissions  settings that apply to the
                 bucket, and provides information about those settings.

                 effectivePermission -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the bucket is publicly  accessible  due
                     to  the combination of permissions settings that apply to
                     the bucket. Possible values are:

                     o NOT_PUBLIC - The bucket isn't publicly accessible.

                     o PUBLIC - The bucket is publicly accessible.

                     o UNKNOWN - Amazon  Macie  can't  determine  whether  the
                       bucket is publicly accessible.

                 permissionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The  account-level  and bucket-level permissions settings
                     for the bucket.

                     accountLevelPermissions -> (structure)
                        The account-level permissions settings that  apply  to
