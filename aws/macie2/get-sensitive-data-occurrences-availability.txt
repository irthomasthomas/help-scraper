OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       code -> (string)
          Specifies whether occurrences of sensitive data can be retrieved for
          the  finding. Possible values are: AVAILABLE, the sensitive data can
          be retrieved; and, UNAVAILABLE, the  sensitive  data  can't  be  re-
          trieved.  If  this value is UNAVAILABLE, the reasons array indicates
          why the data can't be retrieved.

       reasons -> (list)
          Specifies why occurrences of sensitive data can't be  retrieved  for
          the finding. Possible values are:

          o ACCOUNT_NOT_IN_ORGANIZATION - The affected account isn't currently
            part of your organization. Or the account is part of your  organi-
            zation  but  Macie isn't currently enabled for the account. You're
            not allowed to access the affected S3 object by using Macie.

          o INVALID_CLASSIFICATION_RESULT - There isn't a corresponding sensi-
            tive  data  discovery result for the finding. Or the corresponding
            sensitive data discovery result isn't  available  in  the  current
            Amazon  Web Services Region, is malformed or corrupted, or uses an
            unsupported storage format. Macie can't verify the location of the
            sensitive data to retrieve.

          o INVALID_RESULT_SIGNATURE  -  The corresponding sensitive data dis-
            covery result is stored in an S3 object that wasn't signed by  Ma-
            cie. Macie can't verify the integrity and authenticity of the sen-
            sitive data discovery result. Therefore, Macie  can't  verify  the
            location of the sensitive data to retrieve.

          o MEMBER_ROLE_TOO_PERMISSIVE  -  The trust or permissions policy for
            the IAM role in the affected member account doesn't meet Macie re-
            quirements for restricting access to the role. Or the role's trust
            policy doesn't specify the correct external ID for your  organiza-
            tion. Macie can't assume the role to retrieve the sensitive data.

          o MISSING_GET_MEMBER_PERMISSION - You're not allowed to retrieve in-
            formation about the association between your account and  the  af-
            fected account. Macie can't determine whether youre allowed to ac-
            cess the affected S3 object as the delegated  Macie  administrator
            for the affected account.

          o OBJECT_EXCEEDS_SIZE_QUOTA  -  The  storage size of the affected S3
            object exceeds the size quota for retrieving occurrences of sensi-
            tive data from this type of file.

          o OBJECT_UNAVAILABLE  -  The affected S3 object isn't available. The
            object was renamed, moved, deleted, or changed after Macie created
            the  finding.  Or  the  object is encrypted with an KMS key that's
            currently disabled.

          o RESULT_NOT_SIGNED - The corresponding sensitive data discovery re-
            sult  is  stored  in  an  S3 object that hasn't been signed. Macie
            can't verify the integrity and authenticity of the sensitive  data
            discovery  result.  Therefore,  Macie can't verify the location of
            the sensitive data to retrieve.

          o ROLE_TOO_PERMISSIVE - Your account is configured to  retrieve  oc-
            currences  of  sensitive  data by using an IAM role whose trust or
            permissions policy doesn't meet Macie requirements for restricting
            access  to  the  role.  Macie cant assume the role to retrieve the
            sensitive data.

          o UNSUPPORTED_FINDING_TYPE - The specified finding isn't a sensitive
            data finding.

          o UNSUPPORTED_OBJECT_TYPE  -  The  affected S3 object uses a file or
            storage format that Macie doesn't support  for  retrieving  occur-
            rences of sensitive data.

          This  value is null if sensitive data can be retrieved for the find-
          ing.

          (string)
              Specifies why occurrences of sensitive data can't  be  retrieved
              for a finding. Possible values are:
