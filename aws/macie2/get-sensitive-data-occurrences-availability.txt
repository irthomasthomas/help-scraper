GET-SENSITIVE-DATA-OCCURRENCES-AVGET-SENSITIVE-DATA-OCCURRENCES-AVAILABILITY()



NAME
       get-sensitive-data-occurrences-availability -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks  whether  occurrences  of  sensitive  data can be retrieved (re-
       vealed) for a finding.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sensitive-data-occurrences-availability
          --finding-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       code -> (string)
          Specifies whether occurrences of sensitive data can be retrieved for
          the finding. Possible values are: AVAILABLE, the sensitive data  can
          be  retrieved;  and,  UNAVAILABLE,  the  sensitive data can't be re-
          trieved. If this value is UNAVAILABLE, the reasons  array  indicates
          why the data can't be retrieved.

       reasons -> (list)
          Specifies  why  occurrences of sensitive data can't be retrieved for
          the finding. Possible values are:

          o INVALID_CLASSIFICATION_RESULT - Amazon Macie can't verify the  lo-
            cation  of  the  sensitive  data to retrieve. There isn't a corre-
            sponding sensitive data discovery result for the finding.  Or  the
            sensitive data discovery result specified by the ClassificationDe-
            tails.detailedResultsLocation field of the  finding  isn't  avail-
            able,  is  malformed  or corrupted, or uses an unsupported storage
            format.

          o OBJECT_EXCEEDS_SIZE_QUOTA - The storage size of  the  affected  S3
            object exceeds the size quota for retrieving occurrences of sensi-
            tive data.

          o OBJECT_UNAVAILABLE - The affected S3 object isn't  available.  The
            object  might  have been renamed, moved, or deleted. Or the object
            was changed after Amazon Macie created the finding.

          o UNSUPPORTED_FINDING_TYPE - The specified finding isn't a sensitive
            data finding.

          o UNSUPPORTED_OBJECT_TYPE  -  The  affected S3 object uses a file or
            storage format that Macie doesn't support  for  retrieving  occur-
            rences of sensitive data.

          This  value is null if sensitive data can be retrieved for the find-
          ing.

          (string)
              Specifies why occurrences of sensitive data can't  be  retrieved
              for a finding. Possible values are:
