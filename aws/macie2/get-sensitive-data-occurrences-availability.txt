OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       code -> (string)
          Specifies whether occurrences of sensitive data can be retrieved for
          the finding. Possible values are: AVAILABLE, the sensitive data  can
          be  retrieved;  and,  UNAVAILABLE,  the  sensitive data can't be re-
          trieved. If this value is UNAVAILABLE, the reasons  array  indicates
          why the data can't be retrieved.

       reasons -> (list)
          Specifies  why  occurrences of sensitive data can't be retrieved for
          the finding. Possible values are:

          o INVALID_CLASSIFICATION_RESULT - Amazon Macie can't verify the  lo-
            cation  of  the  sensitive  data to retrieve. There isn't a corre-
            sponding sensitive data discovery result for the finding.  Or  the
            sensitive data discovery result specified by the ClassificationDe-
            tails.detailedResultsLocation field of the  finding  isn't  avail-
            able,  is  malformed  or corrupted, or uses an unsupported storage
            format.

          o OBJECT_EXCEEDS_SIZE_QUOTA - The storage size of  the  affected  S3
            object exceeds the size quota for retrieving occurrences of sensi-
            tive data.

          o OBJECT_UNAVAILABLE - The affected S3 object isn't  available.  The
            object  might  have been renamed, moved, or deleted. Or the object
            was changed after Amazon Macie created the finding.

          o UNSUPPORTED_FINDING_TYPE - The specified finding isn't a sensitive
            data finding.

          o UNSUPPORTED_OBJECT_TYPE  -  The  affected S3 object uses a file or
            storage format that Macie doesn't support  for  retrieving  occur-
            rences of sensitive data.

          This  value is null if sensitive data can be retrieved for the find-
          ing.

          (string)
              Specifies why occurrences of sensitive data can't  be  retrieved
              for a finding. Possible values are:
