OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket that the request ap-
          plies to.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       profileUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when  Amazon
          Macie most recently recalculated sensitive data discovery statistics
          and details for the bucket. If the  bucket's  sensitivity  score  is
          calculated automatically, this includes the score.

       sensitivityScore -> (integer)
          The  current  sensitivity  score for the bucket, ranging from -1 (no
          analysis due to an error) to 100 (sensitive). By default, this score
          is  calculated automatically based on the amount of data that Amazon
          Macie has analyzed in the bucket and the amount  of  sensitive  data
          that Macie has found in the bucket.

       sensitivityScoreOverridden -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  the  bucket's  current sensitivity score was set
          manually. If this value is true, the score was manually  changed  to
          100.  If this value is false, the score was calculated automatically
          by Amazon Macie.

       statistics -> (structure)
          The sensitive data discovery statistics for the bucket. The  statis-
          tics  capture  the results of automated sensitive data discovery ac-
          tivities that Amazon Macie has performed for the bucket.

          totalBytesClassified -> (long)
              The total amount of data, in bytes, that Amazon Macie  has  ana-
              lyzed in the bucket.

          totalDetections -> (long)
              The  total  number  of occurrences of sensitive data that Amazon
              Macie has found in the bucket's objects.  This  includes  occur-
              rences  that are currently suppressed by the sensitivity scoring
              settings for the bucket (totalDetectionsSuppressed).

          totalDetectionsSuppressed -> (long)
              The total number of occurrences of sensitive data that are  cur-
              rently  suppressed  by  the sensitivity scoring settings for the
              bucket. These represent occurrences of sensitive data that  Ama-
              zon  Macie  found  in  the bucket's objects, but the occurrences
              were manually suppressed. By default, suppressed occurrences are
              excluded from the bucket's sensitivity score.

          totalItemsClassified -> (long)
              The  total  number  of objects that Amazon Macie has analyzed in
              the bucket.

          totalItemsSensitive -> (long)
              The total number of the bucket's objects that Amazon  Macie  has
              found sensitive data in.

          totalItemsSkipped -> (long)
              The total number of objects that Amazon Macie hasn't analyzed in
              the bucket due to an error or issue. For example, the object  is
              a  malformed file. This value includes objects that Macie hasn't
              analyzed for reasons reported by other  statistics  in  the  Re-
              sourceStatistics object.

          totalItemsSkippedInvalidEncryption -> (long)
              The total number of objects that Amazon Macie hasn't analyzed in
              the bucket because the objects are encrypted with a key that Ma-
              cie isn't allowed to use.

          totalItemsSkippedInvalidKms -> (long)
              The total number of objects that Amazon Macie hasn't analyzed in
              the bucket because the objects are encrypted  with  an  KMS  key
              that was disabled or deleted.

          totalItemsSkippedPermissionDenied -> (long)
              The total number of objects that Amazon Macie hasn't analyzed in
              the bucket because Macie isn't allowed to access the objects.
