OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          default.

          kmsManaged -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that use an KMS key to  encrypt  new
              objects by default, either an Amazon Web Services managed key or

              The total number of buckets that use an Amazon S3 managed key to
              encrypt new objects by default. These buckets use Amazon S3 man-
              aged encryption (SSE-S3) by default.

          unencrypted -> (long)
              The  total  number  of buckets that don't encrypt new objects by

              The total number of buckets that don't have a bucket  policy  or
              have a bucket policy that doesn't require server-side encryption
              of new objects. If a bucket policy exists,  the  policy  doesn't
              require  PutObject requests to include the x-amz-server-side-en-
              cryption header and it doesn't require the value for that header
              to be AES256 or aws:kms.

              The  total  number  of  buckets  whose  bucket  policies require
              server-side encryption of new objects.  PutObject  requests  for
              these  buckets  must  include  the  x-amz-server-side-encryption
              header and the value for that header must be AES256 or aws:kms.

          unknown -> (long)
              The total number of buckets that Amazon  Macie  wasn't  able  to

       classifiableObjectCount -> (long)
          The total number of objects that Amazon Macie  can  analyze  in  the
          buckets. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file

          this value based on the size of the latest version of each  applica-
          ble  object in those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the storage
          size of all versions of all applicable objects in the buckets.

       lastUpdated -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when  Amazon

          lates this value based on the size of the latest version of each ob-
          ject in those buckets. This value doesn't reflect the  storage  size
          of all versions of the objects in the buckets.

          lates this value based on the size of the latest version of each ap-
          plicable object in those buckets. This  value  doesn't  reflect  the
          storage  size of all versions of the applicable objects in the buck-
          ets.

       unclassifiableObjectCount -> (structure)
          The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can't analyze  in  the
          buckets.  These objects don't use a supported storage class or don't
          have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.
