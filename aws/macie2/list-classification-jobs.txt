LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()                          LIST-CLASSIFICATION-JOBS()



NAME
       list-classification-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  subset  of  information  about one or more classification
       jobs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-classification-jobs is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: items

OPTIONS
       --filter-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to filter the results.

          excludes -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects,  one  for each condition that determines
              which jobs to exclude from the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a condition that filters the results of  a  request
                 for  information  about  classification  jobs. Each condition
                 consists of a property, an operator, and one or more values.

                 comparator -> (string)
                     The operator to use to filter the results.

                 key -> (string)
                     The property to use to filter the results.

                 values -> (list)
                     An array that lists one or more values to use  to  filter
                     the results.

                     (string)

          includes -> (list)
              An  array  of  objects,  one  for each condition that determines
              which jobs to include in the results.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a condition that filters the results of  a  request

                     (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "excludes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ],
            "includes": [
              {
                "comparator": "EQ"|"GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"NE"|"CONTAINS"|"STARTS_WITH",
                "key": "jobType"|"jobStatus"|"createdAt"|"name",
                "values": ["string", ...]
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --sort-criteria (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the results.

          attributeName -> (string)
              The property to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The  sort  order to apply to the results, based on the value for
              the property specified by the attributeName property. Valid val-
              ues  are:  ASC,  sort the results in ascending order; and, DESC,
              sort the results in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributeName=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributeName": "createdAt"|"jobStatus"|"name"|"jobType",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       items -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each job that matches the filter crite-
          ria specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides  information  about a classification job, including the
              current status of the job.

              bucketCriteria -> (structure)
                 The property- and tag-based conditions that  determine  which
                 S3  buckets are included or excluded from the job's analysis.
                 Each time the job runs, the job uses these criteria to deter-
                 mine which buckets to analyze. A job's definition can contain
                 a bucketCriteria object or  a  bucketDefinitions  array,  not
                 both.

                 excludes -> (structure)
                     The  property-  and  tag-based  conditions that determine
                     which buckets to exclude from the job.

                     and -> (list)
                        An array of conditions, one for  each  condition  that
                        determines  which  buckets  to include or exclude from
                        the job. If you specify more than one condition,  Ama-
                        zon Macie uses AND logic to join the conditions.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a property- or tag-based condition that
                            defines criteria for  including  or  excluding  S3
                            buckets from a classification job.

                            simpleCriterion -> (structure)
                               A property-based condition that defines a prop-
                               erty, operator, and one or more values for  in-
                               cluding or excluding buckets from the job.

                               comparator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use in the condition. Valid
                                   values are EQ (equals) and NE (not equals).

                               key -> (string)
                                   The property to use in the condition.

                               values -> (list)
                                   An array that lists one or more  values  to
                                   use in the condition. If you specify multi-
                                   ple values, Amazon Macie uses OR  logic  to
                                   join the values. Valid values for each sup-
                                   ported property (key) are:

                                   o ACCOUNT_ID - A string that represents the
                                     unique identifier for the Amazon Web Ser-
                                     vices account that owns the bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSION - A string
                                     that  represents an enumerated value that
                                     Macie       defines        for        the
                                     BucketPublicAccess.effectivePermission
                                     property of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_NAME - A string that represents
                                     the name of a bucket.

                                   o S3_BUCKET_SHARED_ACCESS  -  A string that
                                     represents an enumerated value that Macie

                                     BucketMetadata.sharedAccess property of a
                                     bucket.

                                   Values  are  case  sensitive.  Also,  Macie
                                   doesn't support use of  partial  values  or
                                   wildcard characters in these values.

                                   (string)

                                      cluded from a  classification  job.  Tag
                                      keys  and  values  are  case  sensitive.
                                      Also, Amazon Macie doesn't  support  use
                                      of partial values or wildcard characters

                 object  specifies  the  account  ID for an account and one or
                 more buckets to analyze for that account. A job's  definition
                 can contain a bucketDefinitions array or a bucketCriteria ob-

                   job,  you  paused  the  job  and didn't resume it within 30
                   days.

                 o COMPLETE - For a one-time job, Amazon Macie  finished  pro-
                   cessing  the data specified for the job. This value doesn't
                   apply to recurring jobs.

                 o IDLE - For a recurring job, the previous scheduled  run  is
                   complete  and the next scheduled run is pending. This value
                   doesn't apply to one-time jobs.

                 o PAUSED - Macie started running the job but additional  pro-
                   cessing  would  exceed the monthly sensitive data discovery
                   quota for your account or one or more member accounts  that
                   the job analyzes data for.

                 o RUNNING - For a one-time job, the job is in progress. For a
                   recurring job, a scheduled run is in progress.

                   while  it  had  a status of RUNNING and you don't resume it
                   within 30 days of pausing it, the job or job run  will  ex-
                   pire  and  be  cancelled,  depending  on the job's type. To
                   check the  expiration  date,  refer  to  the  UserPausedDe-
                   tails.jobExpiresAt property.

              jobType -> (string)
                 The schedule for running the job. Possible values are:

                   sis.

              lastRunErrorStatus -> (structure)
                 Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access  errors
                 occurred  when  the  job ran. For a recurring job, this value
                 indicates the error status of the job's most recent run.

                 code -> (string)
                     Specifies whether any account- or bucket-level access er-
                     rors occurred when the job ran. For a recurring job, this
                     value indicates the error status of the job's most recent
                     run. Possible values are:

                     o ERROR  -  One  or  more  errors  occurred. Amazon Macie
                       didn't process all the data specified for the job.

                     o NONE - No errors occurred. Macie processed all the data

              userPausedDetails -> (structure)
                 If  the  current  status of the job is USER_PAUSED, specifies
                 when the job was paused and when the job or job run will  ex-
                 pire  and  be  cancelled  if  it isn't resumed. This value is
                 present only if the value for jobStatus is USER_PAUSED.

                 jobExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                     The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO  8601  format,
                     when  the  job or job run will expire and be cancelled if
                     you don't resume it first.

                 jobImminentExpirationHealthEventArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Health  event  that
                     Amazon  Macie  sent to notify you of the job or job run's
                     pending expiration and cancellation. This value  is  null
                     if a job has been paused for less than 23 days.

                 jobPausedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,
