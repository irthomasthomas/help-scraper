NAME
       list-resource-profile-artifacts -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about objects that Amazon Macie selected from an
       S3 bucket for automated sensitive data discovery.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-profile-artifacts is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: artifacts

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket that the request ap-
          plies to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       artifacts -> (list)
          An array of objects, one for each of 1-100 S3  objects  that  Amazon
          Macie selected for analysis.

          If  Macie  has  analyzed  more than 100 objects in the bucket, Macie
          populates the array based on the value for the  ResourceProfileArti-
          fact.sensitive  field  for  an object: true (sensitive), followed by
          false (not sensitive). Macie then populates any remaining  items  in
          the array with information about objects where the value for the Re-
          sourceProfileArtifact.classificationResultStatus field is SKIPPED.

          (structure)
              Provides information about an S3 object that  Amazon  Macie  se-
              lected  for  analysis  while performing automated sensitive data
              discovery for an account, and the  status  and  results  of  the
              analysis. This information is available only if automated sensi-
              tive data discovery has been enabled for the account.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object.

              classificationResultStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the analysis. Possible values are:

                 o COMPLETE - Amazon Macie successfully completed its analysis
                   of the object.

                 o PARTIAL  -  Macie analyzed only a subset of data in the ob-
                   ject. For example, the object is an archive file that  con-
                   tains files in an unsupported format.

                 o SKIPPED  - Macie wasn't able to analyze the object. For ex-
                   ample, the object is a malformed file.

              sensitive -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether Amazon Macie found sensitive  data  in  the
                 object.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  string  to  use in a subsequent request to get the next page of
          results in a paginated response. This value is null if there are  no
          additional pages.
