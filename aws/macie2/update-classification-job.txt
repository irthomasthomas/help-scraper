OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the classification job.

       --job-status (string)
          The new status for the job. Valid values are:

          o CANCELLED  -  Stops the job permanently and cancels it. This value
            is valid only if the job's current status is  IDLE,  PAUSED,  RUN-
            NING, or USER_PAUSED. If you specify this value and the job's cur-
            rent status is RUNNING, Amazon Macie immediately  begins  to  stop
            all  processing  tasks  for the job. You can't resume or restart a
            job after you cancel it.

          o RUNNING - Resumes the job. This value is valid only if  the  job's
            current  status is USER_PAUSED. If you paused the job while it was
            actively running and you specify this value less than 30 days  af-
            ter  you paused the job, Macie immediately resumes processing from
            the point where you paused the job. Otherwise, Macie  resumes  the
            job according to the schedule and other settings for the job.

          o USER_PAUSED - Pauses the job temporarily. This value is valid only
            if the job's current status is IDLE, PAUSED, or  RUNNING.  If  you
            specify  this value and the job's current status is RUNNING, Macie
            immediately begins to pause all processing tasks for the  job.  If
            you  pause  a one-time job and you don't resume it within 30 days,
            the job expires and Macie cancels the job. If you pause  a  recur-
            ring job when its status is RUNNING and you don't resume it within
            30 days, the job run expires and Macie cancels the run.  To  check
            the  expiration  date, refer to the UserPausedDetails.jobExpiresAt
            property.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o PAUSED

          o CANCELLED

          o COMPLETE

          o IDLE

          o USER_PAUSED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
