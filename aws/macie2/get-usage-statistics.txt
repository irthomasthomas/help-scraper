GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()                                  GET-USAGE-STATISTICS()



NAME
       get-usage-statistics -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  (queries)  quotas  and aggregated usage data for one or more
       accounts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-usage-statistics is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: records

OPTIONS
       --filter-by (list)
          An  array  of  objects,  one for each condition to use to filter the
          query results. If you specify more than one condition, Amazon  Macie
          uses an AND operator to join the conditions.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a  condition for filtering the results of a query for
              quota and usage data for one or more Amazon Macie accounts.

              comparator -> (string)
                 The operator to use in the condition. If the  value  for  the
                 key  property  is  accountId, this value must be CONTAINS. If
                 the value for the key property is any other supported  field,
                 this value can be EQ, GT, GTE, LT, LTE, or NE.

              key -> (string)
                 The field to use in the condition.

              values -> (list)
                 An  array that lists values to use in the condition, based on
                 the value for the field specified by the key property. If the
                 value for the key property is accountId, this array can spec-
                 ify multiple values. Otherwise, this array can  specify  only
                 one value.

                 Valid values for each supported field are:

                 o accountId  -  The  unique identifier for an Amazon Web Ser-
                   vices account.

                 o freeTrialStartDate - The date and time, in UTC and extended
                   ISO  8601  format, when the Amazon Macie free trial started
                   for an account.

                 o serviceLimit - A Boolean (true or false) value  that  indi-
                   cates whether an account has reached its monthly quota.

                 o total - A string that represents the current estimated cost
                   for an account.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          comparator=string,key=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "comparator": "GT"|"GTE"|"LT"|"LTE"|"EQ"|"NE"|"CONTAINS",
              "key": "accountId"|"serviceLimit"|"freeTrialStartDate"|"total",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-by (structure)
          The criteria to use to sort the query results.

          key -> (string)
              The field to sort the results by.

          orderBy -> (string)
              The sort order to apply to the results, based on the  value  for
              the  field specified by the key property. Valid values are: ASC,
              sort the results in ascending order; and, DESC, sort the results
              in descending order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,orderBy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "key": "accountId"|"total"|"serviceLimitValue"|"freeTrialStartDate",
            "orderBy": "ASC"|"DESC"
          }

       --time-range (string)
          The inclusive time period to query usage data for. Valid values are:
          MONTH_TO_DATE,  for  the  current  calendar  month  to  date;   and,
          PAST_30_DAYS,  for  the  preceding  30  days. If you don't specify a
          value, Amazon Macie provides usage data for the preceding 30 days.

          Possible values:

          o MONTH_TO_DATE

          o PAST_30_DAYS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The string to use in a subsequent request to get the  next  page  of
          results  in a paginated response. This value is null if there are no
          additional pages.

       records -> (list)
          An array of objects that contains the results of the query. Each ob-

                 for the account. If the account is a member account in an or-
                 ganization, this value is the same as the value for the orga-
                 nization's Amazon Macie administrator account.

                 The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format,  when

                 An  array  of objects that contains usage data and quotas for
                 the account. Each object contains the data for a specific us-

                     currency -> (string)
                        The type of currency that the  value  for  the  metric

                        isServiceLimited -> (boolean)
                            Specifies whether the account has  met  the  quota
