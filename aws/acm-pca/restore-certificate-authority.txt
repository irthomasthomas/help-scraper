RESTORE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                RESTORE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       restore-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores a certificate authority (CA) that is in the DELETED state. You
       can restore a CA during the period that you defined in  the  Permanent-
       DeletionTimeInDays  parameter of the DeleteCertificateAuthority action.
       Currently, you can specify 7 to 30 days. If you did not specify a  Per-
       manentDeletionTimeInDays  value,  by  default you can restore the CA at
       any time in a 30 day period. You can check the time  remaining  in  the
       restoration  period of a private CA in the DELETED state by calling the
       DescribeCertificateAuthority or ListCertificateAuthorities actions. The
       status  of a restored CA is set to its pre-deletion status when the Re-
       storeCertificateAuthority action returns. To change its status  to  AC-
       TIVE  ,  call  the UpdateCertificateAuthority action. If the private CA
       was in the PENDING_CERTIFICATE state at  deletion,  you  must  use  the
       ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate  action  to  import a certificate
       authority into the private CA before it can be  activated.  You  cannot
       restore a CA after the restoration period has ended.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was returned when you called the
          CreateCertificateAuthority action. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 64)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.
