UPDATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                  UPDATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       update-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the status or configuration of a private certificate authority
       (CA). Your private CA must be in the ACTIVE or  DISABLED  state  before
       you  can  update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the ACTIVE
       state or make a CA that is in the DISABLED state active again.

       NOTE:
          Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must  have
          permission  to  write  to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM
          principal making the call does not have permission to write  to  the
          bucket,  then  an  exception  is  thrown.  For more information, see
          Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3 .

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that  issued  the  cer-
          tificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 76)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --revocation-configuration (structure)
          Contains information to enable Online  Certificate  Status  Protocol
          (OCSP)  support,  to  enable a certificate revocation list (CRL), to
          enable both, or to enable neither. If this  parameter  is  not  sup-
          plied,  existing capibilites remain unchanged. For more information,
          see the OcspConfiguration and CrlConfiguration types.

          NOTE:
              The following requirements apply to revocation configurations.

              o A configuration disabling CRLs or OCSP must contain  only  the
                Enabled=False  parameter,  and  will  fail if other parameters
                such as CustomCname or ExpirationInDays are included.

              o In a CRL configuration, the S3BucketName parameter  must  con-
                form to Amazon S3 bucket naming rules .

              o A configuration containing a custom Canonical Name (CNAME) pa-
                rameter for CRLs or OCSP must conform to RFC2396  restrictions
                on the use of special characters in a CNAME.

              o In a CRL or OCSP configuration, the value of a CNAME parameter
                must not include a protocol prefix such  as  "http://"  or  "-
                https://".

          CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration  of the certificate revocation list (CRL), if any,
              maintained by your private CA. A CRL is  typically  updated  ap-
              proximately  30  minutes  after a certificate is revoked. If for
              any reason a CRL update fails, Amazon Web  Services  Private  CA
              makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Boolean  value  that specifies whether certificate revocation
                 lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this  value  to  enable
                 certificate  revocation  for  a  new  CA  when  you  call the
                 CreateCertificateAuthority action or for an existing CA  when
                 you call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

              ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                 Validity period of the CRL in days.

              CustomCname -> (string)
                 Name  inserted  into  the certificate CRL Distribution Points
                 extension that enables the use of an alias for the  CRL  dis-
                 tribution point. Use this value if you don't want the name of
                 your S3 bucket to be public.

                 NOTE:
                     The content of a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must  con-
                     form  to RFC2396 restrictions on the use of special char-
                     acters in URIs. Additionally, the value of the CNAME must
                     not  include  a  protocol  prefix such as "http://" or "-
                     https://".

              S3BucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If  you  do  not
                 provide  a  value  for  the CustomCname argument, the name of
                 your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL Distribution Points ex-
                 tension of the issued certificate. You can change the name of
                 your bucket by calling the UpdateCertificateAuthority  opera-
                 tion. You must specify a bucket policy that allows Amazon Web
                 Services Private CA to write the CRL to your bucket.

                 NOTE:
                     The S3BucketName parameter must conform to the S3  bucket
                     naming rules .

              S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                 Determines  whether the CRL will be publicly readable or pri-
                 vately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you  choose  PUB-
                 LIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over the public inter-
                 net. If you choose BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL, only the  owner
                 of the CRL S3 bucket can access the CRL, and your PKI clients
                 may need an alternative method of access.

                 If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                     Note: This default can cause CA creation to fail in  some
                     circumstances.  If you have have enabled the Block Public
                     Access (BPA) feature in your S3 account,  then  you  must
                     specify     the    value    of    this    parameter    as
                     BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL , and not doing so  results  in
                     an  error.  If  you have disabled BPA in S3, then you can
                     specify either BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  or  PUBLIC_READ
                     as the value.

                 For  more  information,  see Blocking public access to the S3
                 bucket .

              CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configures the behavior of the CRL Distribution Point  exten-
                 sion  for  certificates issued by your certificate authority.
                 If this field is not  provided,  then  the  CRl  Distribution
                 Point  Extension  will be present and contain the default CRL
                 URL.

                 OmitExtension -> (boolean)
                     Configures whether the CRL Distribution  Point  extension
                     should  be  populated with the default URL to the CRL. If
                     set to true , then the CDP extension will not be  present
                     in  any  certificates  issued by that CA unless otherwise
                     specified through CSR or API passthrough.

                     NOTE:
                        Only set this if you have another  way  to  distribute
                        the  CRL  Distribution Points ffor certificates issued
                        by your CA, such as the Matter Distributed  Compliance
                        Ledger

                        This  configuration  cannot  be  enabled with a custom
                        CNAME set.

          OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration of Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)  sup-
              port,  if  any, maintained by your private CA. When you revoke a
              certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 minutes to reflect
              the new status.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Flag  enabling  use of the Online Certificate Status Protocol
                 (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

              OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                 By default, Amazon Web Services Private CA injects an  Amazon
                 Web  Services domain into certificates being validated by the
                 Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer can al-
                 ternatively  use  this  object to define a CNAME specifying a
                 customized OCSP domain.

                 NOTE:
                     The content of a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must  con-
                     form  to RFC2396 restrictions on the use of special char-
                     acters in URIs. Additionally, the value of the CNAME must
                     not  include  a  protocol  prefix such as "http://" or "-
                     https://".

       --status (string)
          Status of your private CA.

          Possible values:

          o CREATING

          o PENDING_CERTIFICATE

          o ACTIVE

          o FAILED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
