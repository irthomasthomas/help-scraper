REVOKE-CERTIFICATE()                                      REVOKE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       revoke-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Revokes  a  certificate that was issued inside Amazon Web Services Pri-
       vate CA. If you enable a certificate revocation  list  (CRL)  when  you
       create  or  update  your private CA, information about the revoked cer-
       tificates will be included in the CRL. Amazon Web Services  Private  CA
       writes the CRL to an S3 bucket that you specify. A CRL is typically up-
       dated approximately 30 minutes after a certificate is revoked.  If  for
       any  reason  the  CRL  update fails, Amazon Web Services Private CA at-
       tempts makes further attempts every 15 minutes. With Amazon CloudWatch,
       you  can  create alarms for the metrics CRLGenerated and Misconfigured-
       CRLBucket . For more information, see Supported CloudWatch Metrics .

       NOTE:
          Both Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must  have
          permission  to  write  to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM
          principal making the call does not have permission to write  to  the
          bucket,  then  an  exception  is  thrown.  For more information, see
          Access policies for CRLs in Amazon S3 .

       Amazon Web Services Private CA also writes  revocation  information  to
       the      audit      report.      For      more     information,     see
       CreateCertificateAuthorityAuditReport .

       NOTE:
          You cannot revoke a root CA self-signed certificate.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that  issued  the  cer-
          tificate to be revoked. This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 90)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --certificate-serial (string)
          Serial number of the certificate to be  revoked.  This  must  be  in
          hexadecimal  format.  You  can retrieve the serial number by calling
          GetCertificate with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  certifi-
          cate you want and the ARN of your private CA. The GetCertificate ac-
          tion retrieves the certificate in the PEM format. You  can  use  the
          following OpenSSL command to list the certificate in text format and
          copy the hexadecimal serial number.
              openssl x509 -in *file_path* -text -noout

          You can also copy the serial number from  the  console  or  use  the
          DescribeCertificate  action in the Certificate Manager API Reference
          .

       --revocation-reason (string)
          Specifies why you revoked the certificate.

          Possible values:

          o UNSPECIFIED

          o KEY_COMPROMISE

          o CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_COMPROMISE

          o AFFILIATION_CHANGED

          o SUPERSEDED

          o CESSATION_OF_OPERATION

          o PRIVILEGE_WITHDRAWN

          o A_A_COMPROMISE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
