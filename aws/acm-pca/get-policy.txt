GET-POLICY()                                                      GET-POLICY()



NAME
       get-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the resource-based policy attached to a private CA. If either
       the private CA resource or the policy cannot be found, this action  re-
       turns a ResourceNotFoundException .

       The  policy  can be attached or updated with PutPolicy and removed with
       DeletePolicy .
          About Policies

       o A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services cus-
         tomer  account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon
         Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of  a
         CA  administrator.  For  more information, see Using a Resource Based
         Policy with ACM Private CA .

       o A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager  (ACM)  to  issue  ACM
         certificates signed by a CA in another account.

       o For  ACM  to  manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM
         user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR  allows  the
         ACM  service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirma-
         tion against the ACM Private CA policy.  For  more  information,  see
         Using a Service Linked Role with ACM .

       o Updates  made  in  Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are re-
         flected in policies. For more information, see Attach  a  Policy  for
         Cross-Account Access .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the private CA that will have
          its policy retrieved. You can find  the  CA's  ARN  by  calling  the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
