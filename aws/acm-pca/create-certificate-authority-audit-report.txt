CREATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY-AUDIT-CREATE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY-AUDIT-REPORT()



NAME
       create-certificate-authority-audit-report -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an audit report that lists every time that your CA private key
       is used. The report is saved in the Amazon S3 bucket that  you  specify
       on  input.  The  IssueCertificate and RevokeCertificate actions use the
       private key.

       NOTE:
          Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to  the
          S3  bucket  that  you  specify. If the IAM principal making the call
          does not have permission to write to the bucket, then  an  exception
          is  thrown.  For  more  information, see Access policies for CRLs in
          Amazon S3 .

       ACM Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon  S3  can  be  protected
       with  encryption.  For  more information, see Encrypting Your Audit Re-
       ports .

       NOTE:
          You can generate a maximum of one report every 30 minutes.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA to be audited. This  is  of
          the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 90)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --s3-bucket-name (string)
          The name of the S3 bucket that will contain the audit report.

       --audit-report-response-format (string)
          The format in which to create the report. This can be either JSON or
          CSV .

          Possible values:

          o JSON

          o CSV

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
