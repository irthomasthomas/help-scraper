NAME
       describe-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information about your private certificate authority (CA) or one
       that has been shared with you. You specify the private CA on  input  by
       its  ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The output contains the status of your
       CA. This can be any of the following:

       o CREATING - Amazon Web Services Private CA is  creating  your  private
         certificate authority.

       o PENDING_CERTIFICATE  -  The certificate is pending. You must use your
         Amazon Web Services Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or subordi-
         nate  CA  to  sign your private CA CSR and then import it into Amazon
         Web Services Private CA.

       o ACTIVE - Your private CA is active.

       o DISABLED - Your private CA has been disabled.

       o EXPIRED - Your private CA certificate has expired.

       o FAILED - Your private CA has failed. Your  CA  can  fail  because  of
         problems  such a network outage or back-end Amazon Web Services fail-
         ure or other errors. A failed CA can  never  return  to  the  pending
         state. You must create a new CA.

       o DELETED  -  Your  private  CA is within the restoration period, after
         which it is permanently deleted. The length of time remaining in  the
         CA's restoration period is also included in this action's output.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 82)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                                   relative distinguished names  (RDNs),  each
                                   of  which  consists of an object identifier
                                   (OID) and a value.  For  more  information,
                                   see  NISTs  definition of Object Identifier
                                   (OID) .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Custom attributes cannot be used in com-
                                      bination with standard attributes.

                                          (OID)  of  the attribute type of the
                                          relative distinguished name (RDN).

                                      Value -> (string)
                                          Specifies  the  attribute  value  of
                                          relative distinguished name (RDN).

                            EdiPartyName -> (structure)

              configuration  or  certificate revocation list (CRL) created and
              maintained by your private CA.

              CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration of the certificate revocation  list  (CRL),  if
                 any,  maintained  by  your private CA. A CRL is typically up-
                 dated approximately 30 minutes after  a  certificate  is  re-
                 voked.  If for any reason a CRL update fails, Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Private CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Boolean value that specifies whether certificate  revoca-
                     tion  lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this value to
                     enable certificate revocation for a new CA when you  call
                     the  CreateCertificateAuthority action or for an existing
                     CA when you call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

                 ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                     Validity period of the CRL in days.

                 CustomCname -> (string)
                     Name  inserted  into  the  certificate  CRL  Distribution
                     Points extension that enables the use of an alias for the
                     CRL distribution point. Use this value if you don't  want
                     the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

                     NOTE:
                        The  content  of  a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must
                        conform to RFC2396 restrictions on the use of  special
                        characters  in  URIs.  Additionally,  the value of the
                        CNAME must not include a protocol prefix  such  as  "-
                        http://" or "https://".

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     Name  of  the  S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do
                     not provide a value for  the  CustomCname  argument,  the
                     name  of  your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL Distribu-
                     tion Points extension of the issued certificate. You  can
                     change   the   name   of   your  bucket  by  calling  the
                     UpdateCertificateAuthority operation. You must specify  a
                     bucket  policy that allows Amazon Web Services Private CA
                     to write the CRL to your bucket.

                     NOTE:
                        The S3BucketName parameter  must  conform  to  the  S3
                        bucket naming rules .

                 S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                     Determines  whether  the CRL will be publicly readable or
                     privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you choose
                     PUBLIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over the public
                     internet. If you choose  BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL,  only
                     the  owner  of  the CRL S3 bucket can access the CRL, and
                     your PKI clients may need an alternative  method  of  ac-
                     cess.

                     If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                        Note:  This  default  can cause CA creation to fail in
                        some circumstances. If you have have enabled the Block
                        Public  Access  (BPA) feature in your S3 account, then
                        you must  specify  the  value  of  this  parameter  as
                        BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  ,  and not doing so results
                        in an error. If you have disabled BPA in S3, then  you
                        can  specify  either BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL or PUB-
                        LIC_READ as the value.

                     For more information, see Blocking public access  to  the
                     S3 bucket .

              OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  of  Online  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
                 support, if any, maintained by your private CA. When you  re-
                 voke  a certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 minutes
                 to reflect the new status.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Flag enabling use of the Online Certificate Status Proto-
                     col (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

                 OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                     By  default,  Amazon  Web  Services Private CA injects an
                     Amazon Web Services domain into certificates being  vali-
                     dated by the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). A
                     customer can alternatively use this object  to  define  a
                     CNAME specifying a customized OCSP domain.

                     NOTE:
                        The  content  of  a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must
                        conform to RFC2396 restrictions on the use of  special
                        characters  in  URIs.  Additionally,  the value of the
                        CNAME must not include a protocol prefix  such  as  "-
                        http://" or "https://".

                     For  more information, see Customizing Online Certificate
                     Status Protocol (OCSP) in the Amazon Web Services Private
                     Certificate Authority User Guide .

          RestorableUntil -> (timestamp)
              The  period  during which a deleted CA can be restored. For more
              information, see the  PermanentDeletionTimeInDays  parameter  of
              the DeleteCertificateAuthorityRequest action.

          KeyStorageSecurityStandard -> (string)
              Defines  a cryptographic key management compliance standard used
              for handling CA keys.

              Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

              Note: Amazon Web Services Region  ap-northeast-3  supports  only
              FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER.  You  must explicitly specify this
              parameter and value when creating a CA in that Region.  Specify-
              ing a different value (or no value) results in an InvalidArgsEx-
              ception with the message "A certificate authority cannot be cre-
              ated in this region with the specified security standard."

          UsageMode -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  the  CA  issues general-purpose certificates
              that typically require a revocation  mechanism,  or  short-lived
              certificates  that  may  optionally omit revocation because they
              expire quickly. Short-lived certificate validity is  limited  to
              seven days.

              The default value is GENERAL_PURPOSE.
