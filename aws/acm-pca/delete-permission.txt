DELETE-PERMISSION()                                        DELETE-PERMISSION()



NAME
       delete-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Revokes  permissions on a private CA granted to the Certificate Manager
       (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

       These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew  ACM  certificates  that
       reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA. If you revoke
       these permissions, ACM will no longer renew the  affected  certificates
       automatically.

       Permissions  can be granted with the CreatePermission action and listed
       with the ListPermissions action.
          About Permissions

       o If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in  the  same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If  the  private  CA and the ACM certificates reside in different ac-
         counts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals.
         Instead,  the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based pol-
         icy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more  informa-
         tion, see Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Pri-
         vate CA .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-permission
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          --principal <value>
          [--source-account <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA that  issued  the
          permissions.   You   can   find   the   CA's   ARN  by  calling  the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.  This  must  have  the  following
          form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 76)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --principal (string)
          The Amazon Web Services service or identity that will  have  its  CA
          permissions  revoked. At this time, the only valid service principal
          is acm.amazonaws.com

       --source-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that calls this action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
