PUT-POLICY()                                                      PUT-POLICY()



NAME
       put-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches a resource-based policy to a private CA.

       A policy can also be applied by sharing a private CA through Amazon Web
       Services Resource Access  Manager  (RAM).  For  more  information,  see
       Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access .

       The   policy   can   be  displayed  with  GetPolicy  and  removed  with
       DeletePolicy .
          About Policies

       o A policy grants access on a private CA to an Amazon Web Services cus-
         tomer  account, to Amazon Web Services Organizations, or to an Amazon
         Web Services Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of  a
         CA  administrator.  For  more information, see Using a Resource Based
         Policy with Amazon Web Services Private CA .

       o A policy permits a user of Certificate Manager  (ACM)  to  issue  ACM
         certificates signed by a CA in another account.

       o For  ACM  to  manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM
         user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR  allows  the
         ACM  service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirma-
         tion against the Amazon Web Services Private CA policy. For more  in-
         formation, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM .

       o Updates  made  in  Amazon Web Services Resource Manager (RAM) are re-
         flected in policies. For more information, see Attach  a  Policy  for
         Cross-Account Access .

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to associate with
          the policy.  The  ARN  of  the  CA  can  be  found  by  calling  the
          ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --policy (string)
          The  path  and file name of a JSON-formatted IAM policy to attach to
          the specified private CA resource. If this policy does  not  contain
          all  required statements or if it includes any statement that is not
          allowed, the PutPolicy action returns  an  InvalidPolicyException  .
          For  information  about  IAM  policy  and  statement  structure, see
          Overview of JSON Policies .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
