IMPORT-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY-CERTIFIIMPORT-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       import-certificate-authority-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  a  signed private CA certificate into ACM Private CA. This ac-
       tion is used when you are using a chain of trust whose root is  located
       outside  ACM Private CA. Before you can call this action, the following
       preparations must in place:

       o In ACM Private CA, call the CreateCertificateAuthority action to cre-
         ate  the  private CA that you plan to back with the imported certifi-
         cate.

       o Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a  certificate
         signing request (CSR).

       o Sign  the  CSR  using  a  root or intermediate CA hosted by either an
         on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.

       o Create a certificate chain and copy the signed  certificate  and  the
         certificate chain to your working directory.

       ACM  Private  CA  supports three scenarios for installing a CA certifi-
       cate:

       o Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by ACM Private CA.

       o Installing a subordinate CA certificate  whose  parent  authority  is
         hosted by ACM Private CA.

       o Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is ex-
         ternally hosted.

       The following additional requirements apply when you import a  CA  cer-
       tificate.

       o Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.

       o A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.

       o Your  certificate  chain  must not include the private CA certificate
         that you are importing.

       o Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordi-
         nate  certificate,  if  any, that your root CA signed must be next to
         last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate
         CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.

       o The chain must be PEM-encoded.

       o The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.

       o The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.
          Enforcement of Critical Constraints

       ACM Private CA allows the following extensions to be marked critical in
       the imported CA certificate or chain.

       o Basic constraints (must be marked critical)

       o Subject alternative names

       o Key usage

       o Extended key usage

       o Authority key identifier

       o Subject key identifier

       o Issuer alternative name

       o Subject directory attributes

       o Subject information access

       o Certificate policies

       o Policy mappings

       o Inhibit anyPolicy

       ACM Private CA rejects the following extensions when  they  are  marked
       critical in an imported CA certificate or chain.

       o Name constraints

       o Policy constraints

       o CRL distribution points

       o Authority information access

       o Freshest CRL

       o Any other extension

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 170)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --certificate (blob)
          The  PEM-encoded  certificate  for  a  private  CA.  This  may  be a
          self-signed certificate in the case of a  root  CA,  or  it  may  be
          signed by another CA that you control.

       --certificate-chain (blob)
          A  PEM-encoded  file  that  contains all of your certificates, other
          than the certificate you're importing, chaining up to your root  CA.
          Your  ACM  Private  CA-hosted or on-premises root certificate is the
          last in the chain, and each certificate in the chain signs  the  one
          preceding.

          This  parameter  must  be supplied when you import a subordinate CA.
          When you import a root CA, there is no chain.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To import your certificate authority certificate into ACM PCA
