LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the Certifi-
       cate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

       These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew  ACM  certificates  that
       reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA.

       Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and revoked
       with the DeletePermission action.
          About Permissions

       o If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in  the  same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If  the  private  CA and the ACM certificates reside in different ac-
         counts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals.
         Instead,  the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based pol-
         icy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more  informa-
         tion, see Using a Resource Based Policy with Amazon Web Services Pri-
         vate CA .

       list-permissions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Permissions

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to inspect. You
          can find the ARN by calling the  ListCertificateAuthorities  action.
          This  must  be  of the form: arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certifi-
          cate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 You  can  get  a
          private CA's ARN by running the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Permissions -> (list)
          Summary  information about each permission assigned by the specified
          private CA, including the action enabled, the policy  provided,  and
          the time of creation.

          (structure)
              Permissions  designate which private CA actions can be performed
              by an Amazon Web Services service or entity. In order for ACM to
              automatically  renew private certificates, you must give the ACM
              service principal all available permissions (IssueCertificate  ,
              GetCertificate  ,  and ListPermissions ). Permissions can be as-
              signed  with  the  CreatePermission  action,  removed  with  the
              DeletePermission action, and listed with the ListPermissions ac-
              tion.

              CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA from which
                 the permission was issued.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the permission was created.

              Principal -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services service or entity that holds the per-
                 mission. At this time, the only valid principal  is  acm.ama-
                 zonaws.com .

              SourceAccount -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that assigned the permission.

              Actions -> (list)
                 The  private  CA  actions that can be performed by the desig-
                 nated Amazon Web Services service.

                 (string)

              Policy -> (string)
                 The name of the policy that is associated  with  the  permis-
                 sion.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and should be used
          for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
