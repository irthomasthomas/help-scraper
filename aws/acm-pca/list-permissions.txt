LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  permissions on a private CA, if any, granted to the Certifi-
       cate Manager (ACM) service principal (acm.amazonaws.com).

       These permissions allow ACM to issue and renew  ACM  certificates  that
       reside in the same Amazon Web Services account as the CA.

       Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and revoked
       with the DeletePermission action.
          About Permissions

       o If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in  the  same
         account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to
         carry out automatic certificate renewals.

       o For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service princi-
         pal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.

       o If  the  private  CA and the ACM certificates reside in different ac-
         counts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals.
         Instead,  the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based pol-
         icy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more  informa-
         tion, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA .

       list-permissions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Permissions

SYNOPSIS
            list-permissions
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA to  inspect.  You
          can  find  the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.
          This must be of  the  form:  arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certifi-
          cate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012  You  can  get a
          private CA's ARN by running the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Permissions -> (list)
          Summary information about each permission assigned by the  specified
          private  CA,  including the action enabled, the policy provided, and
          the time of creation.

          (structure)
              Permissions designate which private CA actions can be  performed
              by an Amazon Web Services service or entity. In order for ACM to
              automatically renew private certificates, you must give the  ACM
              service  principal all available permissions (IssueCertificate ,
              GetCertificate , and ListPermissions ). Permissions can  be  as-
              signed  with  the  CreatePermission  action,  removed  with  the
              DeletePermission action, and listed with the ListPermissions ac-
              tion.

              CertificateAuthorityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the private CA from which
                 the permission was issued.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the permission was created.

              Principal -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services service or entity that holds the per-
                 mission.  At  this time, the only valid principal is acm.ama-
                 zonaws.com .

              SourceAccount -> (string)
                 The ID of the account that assigned the permission.

              Actions -> (list)
                 The private CA actions that can be performed  by  the  desig-
                 nated Amazon Web Services service.

                 (string)

              Policy -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the policy that is associated with the permis-
                 sion.

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and should be used
          for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.



                                                            LIST-PERMISSIONS()
