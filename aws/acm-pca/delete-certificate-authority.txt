DELETE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()                  DELETE-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITY()



NAME
       delete-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Ama-
       zon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete.  You
       can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.

       NOTE:
          Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in
          your CA hierarchy.

       Before you can delete a CA that you have  created  and  activated,  you
       must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action
       and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED .

       Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be  cre-
       ated  (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING ). You can also delete
       it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported  the  signed
       certificate into Amazon Web Services Private CA (that is, the status of
       the CA is PENDING_CERTIFICATE ).

       When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority , the CA's status
       changes to DELETED . However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until
       the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do  not  set  the
       PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30
       days.  You  can  set  the  parameter   from   7   to   30   days.   The
       DescribeCertificateAuthority  action  returns the time remaining in the
       restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore  an
       eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must have the following form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 87)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --permanent-deletion-time-in-days (integer)
          The  number  of  days  to  make  a  CA  restorable after it has been
          deleted. This can be anywhere from 7 to 30 days, with 30  being  the
          default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
