PUT-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT-SCHEDULE()        PUT-BANDWIDTH-RATE-LIMIT-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       put-bandwidth-rate-limit-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       This  action  sets  the  bandwidth  rate limit schedule for a specified
       gateway. By default, gateways do not have a bandwidth rate limit sched-
       ule,  which  means no bandwidth rate limiting is in effect. Use this to
       initiate a gateway's bandwidth rate limit schedule.

OPTIONS
       --bandwidth-rate-limit-intervals (list)
          An array containing bandwidth rate limit schedule  intervals  for  a
          gateway. When no bandwidth rate limit intervals have been scheduled,
          the array is empty.

          (structure)
              Describes a bandwidth rate limit interval for a gateway. A band-
              width rate limit schedule consists of one or more bandwidth rate
              limit intervals. A bandwidth rate limit interval defines  a  pe-
              riod of time on one or more days of the week, during which band-
              width rate limits are specified for uploading,  downloading,  or
              both.

              AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec -> (long)
                 The average upload rate limit component of the bandwidth rate
                 limit interval, in bits per second. This field does  not  ap-
                 pear in the response if the upload rate limit is not set.

                 NOTE:
                     For Backup Gateway, the minimum value is (Value) .

              DaysOfWeek -> (list)
                 The  days  of  the week component of the bandwidth rate limit
                 interval, represented as ordinal numbers from 0 to 6, where 0
                 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.

                 (integer)

              EndHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to end the bandwidth rate limit interval.

              EndMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The minute of the hour to end the bandwidth rate limit inter-
                 val.

                 WARNING:
                     The bandwidth rate limit interval ends at the end of  the
                     minute. To end an interval at the end of an hour, use the
                     value 59 .

              StartHourOfDay -> (integer)
                 The hour of the day to start the bandwidth rate limit  inter-
                 val.

              StartMinuteOfHour -> (integer)
                 The  minute of the hour to start the bandwidth rate limit in-
                 terval. The interval begins at the start of that  minute.  To
                 begin  an  interval exactly at the start of the hour, use the
                 value 0 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec=long,DaysOfWeek=integer,integer,EndHourOfDay=integer,EndMinuteOfHour=integer,StartHourOfDay=integer,StartMinuteOfHour=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AverageUploadRateLimitInBitsPerSec": long,
              "DaysOfWeek": [integer, ...],
              "EndHourOfDay": integer,
              "EndMinuteOfHour": integer,
              "StartHourOfDay": integer,
              "StartMinuteOfHour": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  `  ListGate-
          ways
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BGW_ListGateways.html`__
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  `  ListGate-
          ways
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BGW_ListGateways.html`__
