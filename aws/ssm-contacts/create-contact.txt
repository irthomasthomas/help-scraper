       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

       --idempotency-token (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a contact

       The following create-contact example creates a contact in your environ-
       ment  with a blank plan. The plan can be updated after creating contact
       channels. Use the create-contact-channel command with the output ARN of
       this  command. After you have created contact channels for this contact
       use update-contact to update the plan.

          aws ssm-contacts create-contact \
              --alias "akuam" \
              --display-name "Akua Mansa" \
              --type PERSONAL \
              --plan '{"Stages": []}'

       Output:

          {
              "ContactArn": "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/akuam"
          }

       For more information, see Contacts in the Incident Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ContactArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created contact or  escalation
          plan.
