LIST-PAGE-RESOLUTIONS()                                LIST-PAGE-RESOLUTIONS()



NAME
       list-page-resolutions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the resolution path of an engagement. For example, the escala-
       tion plan engaged in an incident might target an on-call schedule  that
       includes  several  contacts in a rotation, but just one contact on-call
       when the incident starts. The resolution path indicates  the  hierarchy
       of escalation plan > on-call schedule > contact .

       list-page-resolutions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PageResolutions

OPTIONS
       --page-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact engaged for the  inci-
          dent.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.

       PageResolutions -> (list)
          Information about the resolution for an engagement.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the engagement resolution steps. The resolu-
              tion starts from the first contact, which can be  an  escalation
              plan,  then  resolves  to  an on-call rotation, and finally to a
              personal contact.

              The ResolutionContact structure describes  the  information  for
              each node or step in that process. It contains information about
              different contact types, such as the escalation,  rotation,  and
              personal contacts.

              ContactArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a contact in the engagement
                 resolution process.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of contact for a resolution step.

              StageIndex -> (integer)
                 The stage in the escalation plan that resolves to  this  con-
                 tact.
