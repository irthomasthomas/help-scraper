OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Sets the key policy on the specified KMS key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the key policy. The only valid value is default .

       --policy (string)
          The key policy to attach to the KMS key.

          The key policy must meet the following criteria:

          o The key policy must allow the calling principal to make  a  subse-
            quent  PutKeyPolicy  request on the KMS key. This reduces the risk
            that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. For more  information,  see
            Default key policy in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .
            (To omit this  condition,  set  BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck  to
            true.)

          o Each  statement in the key policy must contain one or more princi-
            pals. The principals in the key policy must exist and  be  visible
            to  KMS.  When you create a new Amazon Web Services principal, you
            might need to enforce a delay before including the  new  principal
            in a key policy because the new principal might not be immediately
            visible to KMS. For more information, see Changes that I make  are
            not always immediately visible in the Amazon Web Services Identity
            and Access Management User Guide .

          A key policy document can include only the following characters:

          o Printable ASCII characters from  the  space  character  (\u0020  )
            through the end of the ASCII character range.

          o Printable  characters  in  the  Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement
            character set (through \u00FF ).

          o The tab (\u0009 ),  line  feed  (\u000A  ),  and  carriage  return
            (\u000D ) special characters

          For  information  about key policies, see Key policies in KMS in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .For help writing and format-
          ting  a  JSON  policy document, see the IAM JSON Policy Reference in
          the * Identity and Access Management User Guide * .

       --bypass-policy-lockout-safety-check     |     --no-bypass-policy-lock-
       out-safety-check (boolean)
          Skips  ("bypasses") the key policy lockout safety check. The default
          value is false.

          WARNING:
              Setting this value to true increases the risk that the  KMS  key
              becomes  unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscrimi-
              nately.

              For more information, see Default key policy in the Key  Manage-
              ment Service Developer Guide .

          Use  this  parameter  only  when you intend to prevent the principal
          that is making the request from making  a  subsequent   PutKeyPolicy
          request on the KMS key.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change the key policy for a KMS key

       The  following put-key-policy example changes the key policy for a cus-
       tomer managed key.

       To begin, create a key policy and save it in a local JSON file. In this
       example, the file is key_policy.json. You can also specify the key pol-
       icy as a string value of the policy parameter.

       The first statement in this key policy gives the AWS account permission
       to use IAM policies to control access to the KMS key. The second state-
       ment gives the test-user user permission to run  the  describe-key  and
       list-keys commands on the KMS key.

       Contents of key_policy.json:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:*",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  },
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [
                          "kms:DescribeKey",
                          "kms:ListKeys"
                      ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       To identify the KMS key, this example uses the key ID, but you can also
       usa key ARN. To specify the key policy, the command uses the policy pa-
       rameter. To indicate that the policy is in a file, it uses the required
       file:// prefix. This prefix is required to identify files on  all  sup-
       ported operating systems. Finally, the command uses the policy-name pa-
       rameter with a value of  default.  This  parameter  is  required,  even
       though default is the only valid value.

          aws kms put-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --policy file://key_policy.json

       This  command  does  not produce any output. To verify that the command
       was effective, use the get-key-policy command.  The  following  example
       command  gets the key policy for the same KMS key. The output parameter
       with a value of text returns a text format that is easy to read.

          aws kms get-key-policy \
              --policy-name default \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --output text

       Output:

          {
              "Version" : "2012-10-17",
              "Id" : "key-default-1",
              "Statement" : [
                  {
                      "Sid" : "Enable IAM User Permissions",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
                      },
                      "Action" : "kms:*",
                      "Resource" : "*"
                      },
                      {
                      "Sid" : "Allow Use of Key",
                      "Effect" : "Allow",
                      "Principal" : {
                          "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/test-user"
                      },
                      "Action" : [ "kms:Describe", "kms:List" ],
                      "Resource" : "*"
                  }
              ]
          }
