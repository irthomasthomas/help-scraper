DISABLE-KEY-ROTATION()                                  DISABLE-KEY-ROTATION()



NAME
       disable-key-rotation -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  automatic  rotation of the key material of the specified sym-
       metric encryption KMS key.

       Automatic key rotation is supported only on  symmetric  encryption  KMS
       keys.  You  cannot  enable  automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys ,
       HMAC KMS keys , KMS keys with imported key material , or KMS keys in  a
       custom  key store . To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of
       related multi-Region keys , set the property on the primary key.

       You can enable ( EnableKeyRotation ) and disable automatic rotation  of
       the  key  material in customer managed KMS keys . Key material rotation
       of Amazon Web Services managed KMS keys is not configurable. KMS always
       rotates  the  key  material for every year. Rotation of Amazon Web Ser-
       vices owned KMS keys varies.

       NOTE:
          In May 2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  managed  keys  from  every three years to every year. For de-
          tails, see  EnableKeyRotation .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DisableKeyRotation (key policy)

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies a symmetric encryption KMS key. You cannot enable or dis-
          able automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys , HMAC KMS keys , KMS
          keys  with imported key material , or KMS keys in a custom key store
          .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disable automatic rotation of a KMS key

       The  following disable-key-rotation example disables automatic rotation
       of a customer managed KMS key. To reenable automatic rotation, use  the
       enable-key-rotation command.

          aws kms disable-key-rotation \
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This  command  produces no output. To verify that automatic rotation is
       disable for the KMS key, use the get-key-rotation-status command.

       For more information, see Rotating keys in the AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
