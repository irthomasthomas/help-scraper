REVOKE-GRANT()                                                  REVOKE-GRANT()



NAME
       revoke-grant -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified grant. You revoke a grant to terminate the per-
       missions that the grant allows. For more information, see Retiring  and
       revoking grants in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * .

       When  you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief de-
       lay, usually less than five  minutes,  until  the  grant  is  available
       throughout  KMS.  This state is known as eventual consistency . For de-
       tails, see Eventual consistency in the * Key Management Service  Devel-
       oper Guide * .

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Grants in KMS in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide *  .  For
       examples  of  working with grants in several programming languages, see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a
          different  Amazon  Web  Services account, specify the key ARN in the
          value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:RevokeGrant (key policy).

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the KMS key associated with  the  grant.  To
          get  the  key  ID  and  key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a  KMS  key
          in  a  different  Amazon  Web Services account, you must use the key
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --grant-id (string)
          Identifies  the  grant  to revoke. To get the grant ID, use  Create-
          Grant ,  ListGrants , or  ListRetirableGrants .

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks if your request will succeed. DryRun is an  optional  parame-
          ter.

          To  learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your KMS
          API calls in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To revoke a grant on a customer master key

       The following revoke-grant example deletes a grant from a KMS key.  The
       following example command specifies the grant-id and the key-id parame-
       ters. The value of the key-id parameter can be the key ID or key ARN of
       the KMS key.

          aws kms revoke-grant \
              --grant-id 1234a2345b8a4e350500d432bccf8ecd6506710e1391880c4f7f7140160c9af3 \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To confirm that the grant was revoked,
       use the list-grants command.

       For more information, see Retiring and revoking grants in the  AWS  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide.
