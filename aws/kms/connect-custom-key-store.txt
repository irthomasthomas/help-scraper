CONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                          CONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       connect-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Connects  or  reconnects  a custom key store to its associated CloudHSM
       cluster.

       The custom key store must be connected before you can create  KMS  keys
       in  the  key  store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect
       and reconnect a custom key store at any time.

       To connect a custom key store, its  associated  CloudHSM  cluster  must
       have  at  least  one  active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a
       cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to  the  clus-
       ter,  use  the  CreateHsm operation. Also, the ` kmsuser crypto user <-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-con-
       cepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__  (CU)  must not be logged into the clus-
       ter. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in.

       The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete;
       up  to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it
       does not wait for it to complete.  When  it  succeeds,  this  operation
       quickly  returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no proper-
       ties. However, this response does not  indicate  that  the  custom  key
       store  is  connected.  To  get  the  connection state of the custom key
       store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       During the connection process, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster  that  is
       associated  with  the  custom  key store, creates the connection infra-
       structure, connects to the cluster, logs into the  CloudHSM  client  as
       the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password.

       The  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To
       find the reason, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the
       ConnectionErrorCode  in the response. For help interpreting the Connec-
       tionErrorCode , see  CustomKeyStoresListEntry .

       To fix the failure, use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to dis-
       connect  the  custom  key store, correct the error, use the  UpdateCus-
       tomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use  ConnectCustomKeyStore
       again.

       If  you  are  having  trouble  connecting or disconnecting a custom key
       store, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store  in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

SYNOPSIS
            connect-custom-key-store
          --custom-key-store-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Enter the key store ID of the custom key store that you want to con-
          nect.  To  find  the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCus-
          tomKeyStores operation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To connect a custom key store

       The following connect-custom-key-store example reconnects the specified
       custom key store. You can use a command like this one to connect a cus-
       tom key store for the first time or to reconnect a key store  that  was
       disconnected.

          aws kms connect-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

       This command does not return any output. To verify that the command was
       effective, use the describe-custom-key-stores command.

       For more information, see Connecting and  disconnecting  a  custom  key
       store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
