VERIFY-MAC()                                                      VERIFY-MAC()



NAME
       verify-mac -

DESCRIPTION
       Verifies the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a speci-
       fied message, HMAC KMS key, and MAC algorithm. To verify the HMAC, Ver-
       ifyMac  computes an HMAC using the message, HMAC KMS key, and MAC algo-
       rithm that you specify, and compares the computed HMAC to the HMAC that
       you  specify.  If  the  HMACs are identical, the verification succeeds;
       otherwise, it fails. Verification indicates  that  the  message  hasn't
       changed  since  the HMAC was calculated, and the specified key was used
       to generate and verify the HMAC.

       HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC algorithms that KMS uses conform to industry
       standards defined in RFC 2104 .

       This  operation  is part of KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details,
       see HMAC keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:VerifyMac (key policy)

          Related operations :  GenerateMac

          Eventual consistency : The KMS API follows an  eventual  consistency
          model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency .

OPTIONS
       --message (blob)
          The  message  that  will be used in the verification. Enter the same
          message that was used to generate the HMAC.
              GenerateMac and VerifyMac do not provide  special  handling  for
              message digests. If you generated an HMAC for a hash digest of a
              message, you must verify the HMAC for the same hash digest.

       --key-id (string)
          The KMS key that will be used in the verification.

          Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to generate the HMAC. If
          you identify a different KMS key, the VerifyMac operation fails.

       --mac-algorithm (string)
          The  MAC  algorithm that will be used in the verification. Enter the
          same MAC algorithm that was used to compute the HMAC. This algorithm
          must be supported by the HMAC KMS key identified by the KeyId param-
          eter.

          Possible values:

          o HMAC_SHA_224

          o HMAC_SHA_256

          o HMAC_SHA_384

          o HMAC_SHA_512

       --mac (blob)
          The HMAC to verify. Enter the HMAC that was generated by the  Gener-
          ateMac  operation when you specified the same message, HMAC KMS key,
          and MAC algorithm as the values specified in this request.

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation  comes
          from  a  new  grant that has not yet achieved eventual consistency .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks  if  your request will succeed. DryRun is an optional parame-
          ter.

          To learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your  KMS
          API calls in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       KeyId -> (string)
          The HMAC KMS key used in the verification.

       MacValid -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that indicates whether  the  HMAC  was  verified.  A
          value  of True indicates that the HMAC (Mac ) was generated with the
          specified Message , HMAC KMS key (KeyID ) and MacAlgorithm. .

          If the HMAC is not verified, the VerifyMac operation  fails  with  a
          KMSInvalidMacException  exception. This exception indicates that one
          or more of the inputs changed since the HMAC was computed.

       MacAlgorithm -> (string)
          The MAC algorithm used in the verification.
