CREATE-ALIAS()                                                  CREATE-ALIAS()



NAME
       create-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a friendly name for a KMS key.

       NOTE:
          Adding,  deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission
          to the KMS key. For details, see ABAC for KMS in the Key  Management
          Service Developer Guide .

       You  can  use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the
       DescribeKey operation and in cryptographic operations ,  such  as   En-
       crypt and  GenerateDataKey . You can also change the KMS key that's as-
       sociated with  the  alias  (  UpdateAlias  )  or  delete  the  alias  (
       DeleteAlias ) at any time. These operations don't affect the underlying
       KMS key.

       You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in  the  same
       Amazon  Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one KMS
       key at a time, but a KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS key
       is required. You can't create an alias without a KMS key.

       The  alias  must  be unique in the account and Region, but you can have
       aliases with the same name in different Regions. For detailed  informa-
       tion about aliases, see Using aliases in the Key Management Service De-
       veloper Guide .

       This operation does not return a response. To get the  alias  that  you
       created, use the  ListAliases operation.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  :  No.  You  cannot perform this operation on an
          alias in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions

       o kms:CreateAlias on the alias (IAM policy).

       o kms:CreateAlias on the KMS key (key policy).

       For details, see Controlling access to aliases in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --alias-name (string)
          Specifies the alias name. This value must begin with alias/ followed
          by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias .

          WARNING:
              Do not include confidential or  sensitive  information  in  this
              field.  This  field  may be displayed in plaintext in CloudTrail
              logs and other output.

          The AliasName value must be string of 1-256 characters. It can  con-
          tain  only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores
          (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with  alias/aws/  .
          The  alias/aws/  prefix  is reserved for Amazon Web Services managed
          keys .

       --target-key-id (string)
          Associates the alias with the specified customer managed key  .  The
          KMS key must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          A  valid  key  ID  is required. If you supply a null or empty string
          value, this operation returns an error.

          For help finding the key ID and ARN, see Finding the Key ID and  ARN
          in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide * .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an alias for a KMS key

       The following create-alias command creates an alias named example-alias
       for      the      KMS      key      identified      by      key      ID
       1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.

       Alias names must begin with alias/. Do not use alias names  that  begin
       with alias/aws; these are reserved for use by AWS.

          aws kms create-alias \
              --alias-name alias/example-alias \
              --target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This  command  doesn't return any output. To see the new alias, use the
       list-aliases command.

       For more information, see Using aliases in the AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice Developer Guide.
