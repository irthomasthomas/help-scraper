DELETE-IMPORTED-KEY-MATERIAL()                  DELETE-IMPORTED-KEY-MATERIAL()



NAME
       delete-imported-key-material -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes key material that was previously imported. This operation makes
       the specified KMS key temporarily unusable. To restore the usability of
       the KMS key, reimport the same key material. For more information about
       importing key material into KMS, see Importing Key Material in the  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide .

       When the specified KMS key is in the PendingDeletion state, this opera-
       tion does not change the KMS key's state. Otherwise, it changes the KMS
       key's state to PendingImport .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DeleteImportedKeyMaterial (key policy)

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies  the KMS key from which you are deleting imported key ma-
          terial. The Origin of the KMS key must be EXTERNAL .

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete imported key material from a KMS key

       The following delete-imported-key-material example deletes key material
       that had been imported into a KMS key.

          aws kms delete-imported-key-material \
             --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To verify that  the  key  material  is
       deleted,  use  the  describe-key  command  to  look  for a key state of
       PendingImport or PendingDeletion.

       For more information, see
       `Deleting imported key material<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-delete-key-material.html>`__
        in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
