ENABLE-KEY-ROTATION()                                    ENABLE-KEY-ROTATION()



NAME
       enable-key-rotation -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables automatic rotation of the key material of the specified symmet-
       ric encryption KMS key.

       When you enable automatic rotation of a`customer  managed  KMS  key  <-
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/con-
       cepts.html#customer-cmk>`__ , KMS rotates the key material of  the  KMS
       key  one  year  (approximately 365 days) from the enable date and every
       year thereafter. You can monitor rotation of the key material for  your
       KMS  keys  in  CloudTrail and Amazon CloudWatch. To disable rotation of
       the key material in a customer managed KMS key, use the   DisableKeyRo-
       tation operation.

       Automatic  key  rotation  is supported only on symmetric encryption KMS
       keys . You cannot enable or disable automatic  rotation  of  asymmetric
       KMS keys , HMAC KMS keys , KMS keys with imported key material , or KMS
       keys in a custom key store . The key rotation status of these KMS  keys
       is  always  false . To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of
       related multi-Region keys , set the property on the primary key.

       You cannot enable or disable automatic  rotation  Amazon  Web  Services
       managed  KMS  keys  . KMS always rotates the key material of Amazon Web
       Services managed keys every year. Rotation of Amazon Web Services owned
       KMS keys varies.

       NOTE:
          In  May  2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon Web Ser-
          vices managed keys from every three years (approximately 1,095 days)
          to every year (approximately 365 days).

          New  Amazon  Web Services managed keys are automatically rotated one
          year after they are created, and  approximately  every  year  there-
          after.

          Existing  Amazon Web Services managed keys are automatically rotated
          one year after their most recent rotation,  and  every  year  there-
          after.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state. For details, see Key states of KMS keys in  the  Key  Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use  : No. You cannot perform this operation on a KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies a symmetric encryption KMS key. You cannot enable or dis-
          able automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys , HMAC KMS keys , KMS
          keys with imported key material , or KMS keys in a custom key  store
          . The key rotation status of these KMS keys is always false . To en-
          able or disable automatic rotation of a set of related  multi-Region
          keys , set the property on the primary key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable automatic rotation of a KMS key

       The following enable-key-rotation example enables automatic rotation of
       a  customer  managed KMS key. The KMS key will be rotated one year (ap-
       proximate 365 days) from the date that this command completes and every
       year thereafter.

          aws kms enable-key-rotation \
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To verify that the KMS key is enabled,
       use the get-key-rotation-status command.

       For more information, see Rotating keys in the AWS Key Management  Ser-
       vice Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
