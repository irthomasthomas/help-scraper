UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                            UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       update-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the  properties of a custom key store. You can use this opera-
       tion to change the properties of an CloudHSM key store or  an  external
       key store.

       Use  the required CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key
       store. Use the remaining optional parameters to change its  properties.
       This  operation  does not return any property values. To verify the up-
       dated property values, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in  KMS,  which
       combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the iso-
       lation and control of a key store that you own and manage.

       WARNING:
          When updating the properties of an external key store,  verify  that
          the  updated  settings  connect your key store, via the external key
          store proxy, to the same external key manager as the  previous  set-
          tings,  or  to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with
          the same cryptographic keys.  If  the  updated  connection  settings
          fail,  you  can fix them and retry, although an extended delay might
          disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However,  if  KMS  permanently
          loses  its  access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under
          those keys is unrecoverable.

       NOTE:
          For external key stores:

          Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating  an
          external key store. For details, see your external key manager docu-
          mentation.

          When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can  up-
          load  a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values.
          You cannot upload the proxy configuration  file  to  the  UpdateCus-
          tomKeyStore operation. However, you can use the file to help you de-
          termine the correct values for the UpdateCustomKeyStore parameters.

       For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this  operation  to  change  the
       custom  key  store  friendly name (NewCustomKeyStoreName ), to tell KMS
       about a change to the kmsuser crypto user password (KeyStorePassword ),
       or  to  associate  the  custom key store with a different, but related,
       CloudHSM cluster (CloudHsmClusterId ). To update  any  property  of  an
       CloudHSM  key store, the ConnectionState of the CloudHSM key store must
       be DISCONNECTED .

       For an external key store, you can use this  operation  to  change  the
       custom key store friendly name (NewCustomKeyStoreName ), or to tell KMS
       about a change to the external key store proxy  authentication  creden-
       tials (XksProxyAuthenticationCredential ), connection method (XksProxy-
       Connectivity ), external proxy endpoint (XksProxyUriEndpoint ) and path
       (XksProxyUriPath  ). For external key stores with an XksProxyConnectiv-
       ity of VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE , you can also update the Amazon  VPC  end-
       point  service  name  (XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName ). To update most
       properties of an external key store, the ConnectionState of the  exter-
       nal  key  store must be DISCONNECTED . However, you can update the Cus-
       tomKeyStoreName , XksProxyAuthenticationCredential ,  and  XksProxyUri-
       Path  of  an  external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCON-
       NECTED state.

       If your update requires a DISCONNECTED state, before  using  UpdateCus-
       tomKeyStore , use the  DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect
       the custom key store. After  the  UpdateCustomKeyStore  operation  com-
       pletes,  use  the   ConnectCustomKeyStore  to  reconnect the custom key
       store. To find the ConnectionState of the custom  key  store,  use  the
       DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       Before  updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow
       KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For exam-
       ple,  before  you change the XksProxyUriPath value, verify that the ex-
       ternal key store proxy is reachable at the new path.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a  cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Identifies  the  custom key store that you want to update. Enter the
          ID of the custom key store. To find the ID of a  custom  key  store,
          use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       --new-custom-key-store-name (string)
          Changes  the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that
          you specify. The custom key store name must be unique in the  Amazon
          Web Services account.

          To change this value, an CloudHSM key store must be disconnected. An
          external key store can be connected or disconnected.

       --key-store-password (string)
          Enter the current password of the kmsuser crypto user  (CU)  in  the
          CloudHSM  cluster that is associated with the custom key store. This
          parameter is valid only for custom key stores with a CustomKeyStore-
          Type of AWS_CLOUDHSM .

          This  parameter tells KMS the current password of the kmsuser crypto
          user (CU). It does not set or change the password of  any  users  in
          the CloudHSM cluster.

          To change this value, the CloudHSM key store must be disconnected.

       --cloud-hsm-cluster-id (string)
          Associates  the  custom  key  store with a related CloudHSM cluster.
          This parameter is valid only for custom key stores with a CustomKey-
          StoreType of AWS_CLOUDHSM .

          Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you used to create the cus-
          tom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history and has  the
          same  cluster  certificate  as  the original cluster. You cannot use
          this parameter to associate a custom key  store  with  an  unrelated
          cluster.  In  addition, the replacement cluster must fulfill the re-
          quirements for a cluster associated with a custom key store. To view
          the cluster certificate of a cluster, use the DescribeClusters oper-
          ation.

          To change this value, the CloudHSM key store must be disconnected.

       --xks-proxy-uri-endpoint (string)
          Changes the URI endpoint that KMS uses to connect to  your  external
          key store proxy (XKS proxy). This parameter is valid only for custom
          key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE .

          For external key stores with an XksProxyConnectivity value  of  PUB-
          LIC_ENDPOINT , the protocol must be HTTPS.

          For  external  key  stores  with  an  XksProxyConnectivity  value of
          VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE , specify https:// followed by the private  DNS
          name  associated  with  the  VPC endpoint service. Each external key
          store must use a different private DNS name.

          The combined XksProxyUriEndpoint and XksProxyUriPath values must  be
          unique in the Amazon Web Services account and Region.

          To change this value, the external key store must be disconnected.

       --xks-proxy-uri-path (string)
          Changes the base path to the proxy APIs for this external key store.
          To find this value, see the documentation for your external key man-
          ager  and  external  key  store proxy (XKS proxy). This parameter is
          valid only for custom key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of EXTER-
          NAL_KEY_STORE .

          The value must start with / and must end with /kms/xks/v1 , where v1
          represents the version of the KMS external key store proxy API.  You
          can include an optional prefix between the required elements such as
          /*example* /kms/xks/v1 .

          The combined XksProxyUriEndpoint and XksProxyUriPath values must  be
          unique in the Amazon Web Services account and Region.

          You  can  change this value when the external key store is connected
          or disconnected.

       --xks-proxy-vpc-endpoint-service-name (string)
          Changes the name that KMS uses to identify the Amazon  VPC  endpoint
          service  for your external key store proxy (XKS proxy). This parame-
          ter is valid when the CustomKeyStoreType is  EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE  and
          the XksProxyConnectivity is VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE .

          To change this value, the external key store must be disconnected.

       --xks-proxy-authentication-credential (structure)
          Changes the credentials that KMS uses to sign requests to the exter-
          nal key store proxy (XKS proxy). This parameter is  valid  only  for
          custom key stores with a CustomKeyStoreType of EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE .

          You  must  specify both the AccessKeyId and SecretAccessKey value in
          the authentication credential, even if you  are  only  updating  one
          value.

          This  parameter doesn't establish or change your authentication cre-
          dentials on the proxy. It just tells KMS the credential that you es-
          tablished  with  your  external key store proxy. For example, if you
          rotate the credential on your external key store proxy, you can  use
          this parameter to update the credential in KMS.

          You  can  change this value when the external key store is connected
          or disconnected.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the raw secret access key.

          RawSecretAccessKey -> (string)
              A secret string of 43-64 characters. Valid characters  are  a-z,
              A-Z, 0-9, /, +, and =.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccessKeyId=string,RawSecretAccessKey=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccessKeyId": "string",
            "RawSecretAccessKey": "string"
          }

       --xks-proxy-connectivity (string)
          Changes  the connectivity setting for the external key store. To in-
          dicate that the external key store proxy uses a Amazon VPC  endpoint
          service to communicate with KMS, specify VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE . Oth-
          erwise, specify PUBLIC_ENDPOINT .

          If you change the XksProxyConnectivity to VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE , you
          must  also change the XksProxyUriEndpoint and add an XksProxyVpcEnd-
          pointServiceName value.

          If you change the XksProxyConnectivity to PUBLIC_ENDPOINT , you must
          also  change  the  XksProxyUriEndpoint  and  specify a null or empty
          string for the XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName value.

          To change this value, the external key store must be disconnected.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC_ENDPOINT

          o VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To edit custom key store settings

       The following  update-custom-key-store  example  provides  the  current
       password  for  the  kmsuser  in the CloudHSM cluster that is associated
       with the specified key store. This command doesn't change  the  kmsuser
       password.  It  just  tells AWS KMS the current password. If KMS doesn't
       have the current kmsuser password, it cannot connect to the custom  key
       store.

       NOTE: Before updating the custom key store, you must disconnect it. Use
       the disconnect-custom-key-store command. After the  command  completes,
       you   can   reconnect  the  custom  key  store.  Use  the  connect-cus-
       tom-key-store command.

          aws kms update-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --key-store-password ExamplePassword

       This command does not return any output. To verify  that  the  password
       change was effective, connect the custom key store.

       For  more information, see Editing custom key store settings in the AWS
       Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
