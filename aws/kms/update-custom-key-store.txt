UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                            UPDATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       update-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes  the properties of a custom key store. Use the CustomKeyStoreId
       parameter to identify the custom key store you want to  edit.  Use  the
       remaining parameters to change the properties of the custom key store.

       You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To discon-
       nect the custom key store, use  DisconnectCustomKeyStore . To reconnect
       the custom key store after the update completes, use  ConnectCustomKey-
       Store . To find the connection state of a custom  key  store,  use  the
       DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       The  CustomKeyStoreId  parameter  is  required in all commands. Use the
       other parameters of UpdateCustomKeyStore to edit your  key  store  set-
       tings.

       o Use  the  NewCustomKeyStoreName parameter to change the friendly name
         of the custom key store to the value that you specify.

       o Use the KeyStorePassword parameter tell KMS the current  password  of
         the       `       kmsuser       crypto       user       (CU)       <-
         https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-con-
         cepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__  in  the  associated CloudHSM cluster.
         You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when
         KMS  cannot log into the associated cluster because the kmsuser pass-
         word has changed. This value does not  change  the  password  in  the
         CloudHSM cluster.

       o Use the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to associate the custom key store
         with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster. You can use this pa-
         rameter  to repair a custom key store if its CloudHSM cluster becomes
         corrupted or is deleted, or when you need  to  create  or  restore  a
         cluster from a backup.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

       This  operation is part of the custom key store feature feature in KMS,
       which combines the convenience and extensive integration  of  KMS  with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Identifies the custom key store that you want to update.  Enter  the
          ID  of  the  custom key store. To find the ID of a custom key store,
          use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

       --new-custom-key-store-name (string)
          Changes the friendly name of the custom key store to the value  that
          you  specify. The custom key store name must be unique in the Amazon
          Web Services account.

       --key-store-password (string)
          Enter the current password of the kmsuser crypto user  (CU)  in  the
          CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store.

          This  parameter tells KMS the current password of the kmsuser crypto
          user (CU). It does not set or change the password of  any  users  in
          the CloudHSM cluster.

       --cloud-hsm-cluster-id (string)
          Associates the custom key store with a related CloudHSM cluster.

          Enter the cluster ID of the cluster that you used to create the cus-
          tom key store or a cluster that shares a backup history and has  the
          same  cluster  certificate  as  the original cluster. You cannot use
          this parameter to associate a custom key  store  with  an  unrelated
          cluster.  In  addition, the replacement cluster must fulfill the re-
          quirements for a cluster associated with a custom key store. To view
          the cluster certificate of a cluster, use the DescribeClusters oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To edit custom key store settings

       The following  update-custom-key-store  example  provides  the  current
       password  for  the  kmsuser  in the CloudHSM cluster that is associated
       with the specified key store. This command doesn't change  the  kmsuser
       password.  It  just  tells AWS KMS the current password. If KMS doesn't
       have the current kmsuser password, it cannot connect to the custom  key
       store.

       NOTE: Before updating the custom key store, you must disconnect it. Use
       the disconnect-custom-key-store command. After the  command  completes,
       you   can   reconnect  the  custom  key  store.  Use  the  connect-cus-
       tom-key-store command.

          aws kms update-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0 \
              --key-store-password ExamplePassword

       This command does not return any output. To verify  that  the  password
       change was effective, connect the custom key store.

       For  more information, see Editing custom key store settings in the AWS
       Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
