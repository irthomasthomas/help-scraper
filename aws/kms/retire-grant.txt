RETIRE-GRANT()                                                  RETIRE-GRANT()



NAME
       retire-grant -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a grant. Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need
       its permissions. To identify the grant to retire, use a grant  token  ,
       or  both  the  grant ID and a key identifier (key ID or key ARN) of the
       KMS key. The  CreateGrant operation returns both values.

       This operation can be called by the retiring principal for a grant,  by
       the  grantee  principal  if the grant allows the RetireGrant operation,
       and by the Amazon Web Services account in which the grant  is  created.
       It  can  also be called by principals to whom permission for retiring a
       grant is delegated. For details, see Retiring and  revoking  grants  in
       the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see
       Grants in KMS in the * Key Management Service Developer Guide *  .  For
       examples  of  working with grants in several programming languages, see
       Programming grants .
          Cross-account use : Yes. You can retire a grant on a KMS  key  in  a
          different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required  permissions:  :Permission  to retire a grant is determined
          primarily by the grant.  For  details,  see  Retiring  and  revoking
          grants in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --grant-token (string)
          Identifies  the  grant  to  be retired. You can use a grant token to
          identify a new grant even before it has  achieved  eventual  consis-
          tency.

          Only  the  CreateGrant operation returns a grant token. For details,
          see Grant token and Eventual consistency in the Key Management  Ser-
          vice Developer Guide .

       --key-id (string)
          The  key ARN KMS key associated with the grant. To find the key ARN,
          use the  ListKeys operation.

          For                                                         example:
          arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:444455556666:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       --grant-id (string)
          Identifies the grant to retire. To get the grant  ID,  use   Create-
          Grant ,  ListGrants , or  ListRetirableGrants .

          o Grant                 ID                 Example                 -
            0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Checks if your request will succeed. DryRun is an  optional  parame-
          ter.

          To  learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your KMS
          API calls in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retire a grant on a customer master key

       The following retire-grant example deletes a grant from a KMS key.

       The following example command specifies the grant-id and the key-id pa-
       rameters.  The value of the key-id parameter must be the key ARN of the
       KMS key.

          aws kms retire-grant \
              --grant-id 1234a2345b8a4e350500d432bccf8ecd6506710e1391880c4f7f7140160c9af3 \
              --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output. To confirm that the grant was retired,
       use the list-grants command.

       For  more  information, see Retiring and revoking grants in the AWS Key
       Management Service Developer Guide.
