UNTAG-RESOURCE()                                              UNTAG-RESOURCE()



NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes tags from a customer managed key . To delete a tag, specify the
       tag key and the KMS key.

       NOTE:
          Tagging or untagging a KMS key can allow or deny permission  to  the
          KMS key. For details, see ABAC for KMS in the Key Management Service
          Developer Guide .

       When it succeeds, the UntagResource operation doesn't return  any  out-
       put.  Also,  if  the  specified  tag key isn't found on the KMS key, it
       doesn't throw an exception or return a response. To  confirm  that  the
       operation worked, use the  ListResourceTags operation.

       For information about using tags in KMS, see Tagging keys . For general
       information about tags, including the format and  syntax,  see  Tagging
       Amazon Web Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Refer-
       ence .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:UntagResource (key policy)

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the KMS key from which you are removing tags.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --tag-keys (list)
          One or more tag keys. Specify only the tag keys, not the tag values.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a tag from a KMS key

       The following untag-resource example deletes the tag with the "Purpose"
       key from a customer managed KMS key.

       To specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example  uses  a
       key  ID value, but you can use a key ID or key ARN in this command. Be-
       fore running this command, replace the example key ID with a valid  key
       ID from your AWS account.

          aws kms untag-resource \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
              --tag-key 'Purpose'

       This  command  produces  no  output. To view the tags on an AWS KMS KMS
       key, use the list-resource-tags command.

       For more information about using tags in AWS KMS, see Tagging  keys  in
       the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
