UPDATE-ALIAS()                                                  UPDATE-ALIAS()



NAME
       update-alias -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  an  existing KMS alias with a different KMS key. Each alias
       is associated with only one KMS key at a time, although a KMS  key  can
       have  multiple  aliases.  The alias and the KMS key must be in the same
       Amazon Web Services account and Region.

       NOTE:
          Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny  permission
          to  the KMS key. For details, see ABAC for KMS in the Key Management
          Service Developer Guide .

       The current and new KMS key must be the same type  (both  symmetric  or
       both  asymmetric  or both HMAC), and they must have the same key usage.
       This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must
       assign  an  alias  to  a different type of KMS key, use  DeleteAlias to
       delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to create a new alias.

       You cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an  alias
       name, use  DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and  CreateAlias to cre-
       ate a new alias.

       Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you  can  create,  up-
       date,  and  delete  the  aliases of a KMS key without affecting the KMS
       key. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the   DescribeKey
       operation.  To  get the aliases of all KMS keys in the account, use the
       ListAliases operation.

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the alias (IAM policy).

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the current KMS key (key policy).

       o kms:UpdateAlias on the new KMS key (key policy).

       For  details,  see  Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --alias-name (string)
          Identifies the alias that is changing its KMS key. This  value  must
          begin  with  alias/  followed by the alias name, such as alias/Exam-
          pleAlias . You cannot use UpdateAlias to change the alias name.

       --target-key-id (string)
          Identifies the customer managed key to associate with the alias. You
          don't  have permission to associate an alias with an Amazon Web Ser-
          vices managed key .

          The KMS key must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and  Re-
          gion  as  the  alias.  Also, the new target KMS key must be the same
          type as the current target KMS key (both symmetric or both  asymmet-
          ric or both HMAC) and they must have the same key usage.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

          To verify that the alias is mapped  to  the  correct  KMS  key,  use
          ListAliases .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To associate an alias with a different KMS key

       The  following update-alias example associates the alias alias/test-key
       with a different KMS key.

       o The --alias-name parameter specifies the alias. The alias name  value
         must begin with alias/.

       o The --target-key-id parameter specifies the KMS key to associate with
         the alias. You don't need to specify the  current  KMS  key  for  the
         alias.

            aws kms update-alias \
                --alias-name alias/test-key \
                --target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This   command   produces  no  output.  To  find  the  alias,  use  the
       list-aliases command.

       Service Developer Guide.
