NAME
       list-keys -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of all KMS keys in the caller's Amazon Web Services account
       and Region.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:ListKeys (IAM policy)

       list-keys is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
       order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagi-
       nation  by  providing  the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output
       text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  ar-
       gument  must  extract  data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Keys

SYNOPSIS
            list-keys
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the KMS keys in an account and Region

       The following list-keys example gets the KMS keys in an account and Re-
       gion. This command returns both AWS managed keys and  customer  managed
       keys.

          aws kms list-keys

       Output:

          {
              "Keys": [
                  {
                      "KeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
                  },
                  {
                      "KeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321",
                      "KeyId": "0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
                  },
                  {
                      "KeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d",
                      "KeyId": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Keys -> (list)
          A list of KMS keys.

          (structure)
              Contains information about each entry in the key list.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier of the key.

              KeyArn -> (string)
                 ARN of the key.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When Truncated is true, this element is  present  and  contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this value is true, the list in this response is truncated.  To  get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
