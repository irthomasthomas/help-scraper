GENERATE-RANDOM()                                            GENERATE-RANDOM()



NAME
       generate-random -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a random byte string that is cryptographically secure.

       You  must  use the NumberOfBytes parameter to specify the length of the
       random byte string. There is no default value for string length.

       By default, the random byte string is generated in KMS. To generate the
       byte  string  in  the  CloudHSM cluster associated with an CloudHSM key
       store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter.
          GenerateRandom also supports Amazon Web Services  Nitro  Enclaves  ,
          which provide an isolated compute environment in Amazon EC2. To call
          GenerateRandom for a Nitro enclave, use the Amazon Web Services  Ni-
          tro  Enclaves  SDK or any Amazon Web Services SDK. Use the Recipient
          parameter to provide the attestation document for the  enclave.  In-
          stead  of plaintext bytes, the response includes the plaintext bytes
          encrypted under the public key from the  attestation  document  (Ci-
          phertextForRecipient ).For information about the interaction between
          KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see How Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Nitro  Enclaves uses KMS in the Key Management Service Devel-
          oper Guide .

       For more information about entropy and random  number  generation,  see
       Key Management Service Cryptographic Details .
          Cross-account  use : Not applicable. GenerateRandom does not use any
          account-specific resources, such as KMS keys.

          Required permissions : kms:GenerateRandom (IAM policy)

          Eventual consistency : The KMS API follows an  eventual  consistency
          model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency .

OPTIONS
       --number-of-bytes (integer)
          The length of the random byte string. This parameter is required.

       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Generates the random byte string in the CloudHSM cluster that is as-
          sociated with the specified CloudHSM key store. To find the ID of  a
          custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores operation.

          External  key  store  IDs  are  not valid for this parameter. If you
          specify the ID of an external key store,  GenerateRandom  throws  an
          UnsupportedOperationException .

       --recipient (structure)
          A  signed attestation document from an Amazon Web Services Nitro en-
          clave and the encryption algorithm to use with the enclave's  public
          key. The only valid encryption algorithm is RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 .

          This  parameter  only  supports attestation documents for Amazon Web
          Services Nitro Enclaves. To include this parameter, use  the  Amazon
          Web Services Nitro Enclaves SDK or any Amazon Web Services SDK.

          When  you  use this parameter, instead of returning plaintext bytes,
          KMS encrypts the plaintext bytes under the public key in the  attes-
          tation document, and returns the resulting ciphertext in the Cipher-
          textForRecipient field in the response. This ciphertext can  be  de-
          crypted  only  with  the  private  key in the enclave. The Plaintext
          field in the response is null or empty.

          For information about the interaction between  KMS  and  Amazon  Web
          Services  Nitro Enclaves, see How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves
          uses KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          KeyEncryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
              The encryption algorithm that KMS should use with the public key
              for  an  Amazon  Web Services Nitro Enclave to encrypt plaintext
              values   for   the   response.   The   only   valid   value   is
              RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256 .

          AttestationDocument -> (blob)
              The  attestation  document  for an Amazon Web Services Nitro En-
              clave. This document includes the enclave's public key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyEncryptionAlgorithm=string,AttestationDocument=blob

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "KeyEncryptionAlgorithm": "RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256",
            "AttestationDocument": blob
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To generate a 256-bit random byte string (Linux or macOs)

       The following generate-random example generates  a  256-bit  (32-byte),
       base64-encoded  random byte string. The example decodes the byte string
       and saves it in the random file.

       When you run this command, you must use the  number-of-bytes  parameter
       to specify the length of the random value in bytes.

       You  don't specify a KMS key when you run this command. The random byte
       string is unrelated to any KMS key.

       By default, AWS KMS generates the random number. However, if you  spec-
       ify a
       `custom key store<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html>`__
       , the random byte string is generated in the AWS CloudHSM cluster asso-
       ciated with the custom key store.

       This example uses the following parameters and values:

       o It uses the required --number-of-bytes parameter with a value  of  32
         to request a 32-byte (256-bit) string.

       o It uses the --output parameter with a value of text to direct the AWS
         CLI to return the output as text, instead of JSON.

       o It uses the --query parameter to extract the value of  the  Plaintext
         property from the response.

       o It pipes ( | ) the output of the command to the base64 utility, which
         decodes the extracted output.

       o It uses the redirection operator ( > ) to save decoded byte string to
         the ExampleRandom file.

       o It  uses the redirection operator ( > ) to save the binary ciphertext
         to a file.

            aws kms generate-random \
                --number-of-bytes 32 \
                --output text \
                --query Plaintext | base64 --decode > ExampleRandom

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see GenerateRandom in the AWS Key Management Ser-
       vice API Reference.

       Example 2: To generate a 256-bit random number (Windows Command Prompt)

       The  following  example  uses the generate-random command to generate a
       256-bit (32-byte), base64-encoded random byte string. The  example  de-
       codes  the byte string and saves it in the random file. This example is
       the same as the previous example, except  that  it  uses  the  certutil
       utility  in Windows to base64-decode the random byte string before sav-
       ing it in a file.

       First, generate a base64-encoded random byte string and saves it  in  a
       temporary file, ExampleRandom.base64.

          aws kms generate-random \
              --number-of-bytes 32 \
              --output text \
              --query Plaintext > ExampleRandom.base64

       Because  the  output of the generate-random command is saved in a file,
       this example produces no output.

       Now use the certutil -decode command to decode the base64-encoded  byte
       string  in  the  ExampleRandom.base64  file. Then, it saves the decoded
       byte string in the ExampleRandom file.

          certutil -decode ExampleRandom.base64 ExampleRandom

       Output:

          Input Length = 18
          Output Length = 12
          CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.

       For more information, see GenerateRandom in the AWS Key Management Ser-
       vice API Reference.

OUTPUT
       Plaintext -> (blob)
          The  random byte string. When you use the HTTP API or the Amazon Web
          Services CLI, the value is  Base64-encoded.  Otherwise,  it  is  not
          Base64-encoded.

          If  the  response  includes  the  CiphertextForRecipient  field, the
          Plaintext field is null or empty.

       CiphertextForRecipient -> (blob)
          The plaintext random bytes encrypted with the public  key  from  the
          Nitro enclave. This ciphertext can be decrypted only by using a pri-
          vate key in the Nitro enclave.

          This field is included in the response only when the  Recipient  pa-
          rameter in the request includes a valid attestation document from an
          Amazon Web Services Nitro enclave. For information about the  inter-
          action  between  KMS and Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see How
          Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves uses KMS in  the  Key  Management
          Service Developer Guide .
