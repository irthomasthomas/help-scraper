DESCRIBE-KEY()                                                  DESCRIBE-KEY()



NAME
       describe-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  detailed information about a KMS key. You can run DescribeKey
       on a customer managed key or an Amazon Web Services managed key .

       This detailed information includes the  key  ARN,  creation  date  (and
       deletion  date, if applicable), the key state, and the origin and expi-
       ration date (if any) of the key  material.  It  includes  fields,  like
       KeySpec  ,  that  help  you distinguish different types of KMS keys. It
       also displays the key usage (encryption,  signing,  or  generating  and
       verifying  MACs)  and the algorithms that the KMS key supports. For KMS
       keys in custom key stores, it includes information about the custom key
       store,  such  as  the  key  store  ID  and the CloudHSM cluster ID. For
       multi-Region keys, it displays the primary key and all related  replica
       keys.
          DescribeKey does not return the following information:

       o Aliases  associated  with  the  KMS key. To get this information, use
         ListAliases .

       o Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the KMS key. To get this
         information,  use   GetKeyRotationStatus . Also, some key states pre-
         vent a KMS key from being automatically rotated. For details, see How
         Automatic  Key Rotation Works in the Key Management Service Developer
         Guide .

       o Tags on the KMS key. To get this information, use  ListResourceTags .

       o Key policies and grants on the KMS key. To get this information,  use
         GetKeyPolicy and  ListGrants .

       In  general,  DescribeKey  is a non-mutating operation. It returns data
       about KMS keys, but doesn't change them. However, Amazon  Web  Services
       services  use  DescribeKey  to  create Amazon Web Services managed keys
       from a predefined Amazon Web Services alias with no key ID.
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in
          a  different  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or
          alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

          Required permissions : kms:DescribeKey (key policy)

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Describes the specified KMS key.

          If you specify a predefined Amazon Web Services alias (an Amazon Web
          Services  alias  with  no  key ID), KMS associates the alias with an
          Amazon Web Services managed key and returns its KeyId and Arn in the
          response.

          To  specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To  specify
          a  KMS  key in a different Amazon Web Services account, you must use
          the key ARN or alias ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey . To get the alias name and alias ARN, use  ListAliases .

       --grant-tokens (list)
          A list of grant tokens.

          Use  a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
          from a new grant that has not yet achieved  eventual  consistency  .
          For more information, see Grant token and Using a grant token in the
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To find detailed information about a KMS key

       The following describe-key example gets detailed information about  the
       AWS  managed  key  for Amazon S3 in the example account and Region. You
       can use this command to find details about AWS managed  keys  and  cus-
       tomer managed keys.

       To  specify the KMS key, use the key-id parameter. This example uses an
       alias name value, but you can use a key ID, key  ARN,  alias  name,  or
       alias ARN in this command.

          aws kms describe-key \
              --key-id alias/aws/s3

       The following describe-key example gets  metadata  for  a  multi-Region
       replica  key.  This multi-Region key is a symmetric encryption key. The
       output of a describe-key command for any multi-Region key  returns  in-
       formation about the primary key and all of its replicas.

              When the primary key in a  multi-Region  key  is  scheduled  for
              deletion  but  still  has replica keys, its key state is Pendin-
              gReplicaDeletion and the length of its waiting  period  is  dis-
              played in the PendingDeletionWindowInDays field.

          ValidTo -> (timestamp)
              The  time  at  which the imported key material expires. When the
              key material expires, KMS deletes the key material and  the  KMS
              key  becomes  unusable.  This value is present only for KMS keys
              whose Origin is EXTERNAL and whose ExpirationModel is  KEY_MATE-
              RIAL_EXPIRES , otherwise this value is omitted.

          Origin -> (string)
              The  source of the key material for the KMS key. When this value
              is AWS_KMS , KMS created the key material. When  this  value  is
              EXTERNAL  , the key material was imported or the KMS key doesn't
              have any key material. When this value is AWS_CLOUDHSM , the key
              material  was  created in the CloudHSM cluster associated with a
              custom key store.

          CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the custom key store that  contains  the
              KMS  key. This value is present only when the KMS key is created
              in a custom key store.

          CloudHsmClusterId -> (string)
              The cluster ID of the CloudHSM cluster that contains the key ma-
              terial  for  the  KMS key. When you create a KMS key in a custom
              key store , KMS creates the key material for the KMS key in  the
              associated CloudHSM cluster. This value is present only when the
              KMS key is created in a custom key store.

          ExpirationModel -> (string)
              Specifies whether the KMS key's key material expires. This value
              is  present  only when Origin is EXTERNAL , otherwise this value
              is omitted.

          KeyManager -> (string)
              The manager of the KMS key. KMS keys in your Amazon Web Services
              account  are either customer managed or Amazon Web Services man-
              aged. For more information about the difference, see KMS keys in
              the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          CustomerMasterKeySpec -> (string)
              Instead, use the KeySpec field.

              The  KeySpec  and  CustomerMasterKeySpec  fields  have  the same
              value. We recommend that you use the KeySpec field in your code.
              However,  to  avoid  breaking  changes,  KMS  will  support both
              fields.

          KeySpec -> (string)
              Describes the type of key material in the KMS key.

          EncryptionAlgorithms -> (list)
              The encryption algorithms that the KMS key supports. You  cannot
              use the KMS key with other encryption algorithms within KMS.

              This  value  is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              ENCRYPT_DECRYPT .

              (string)

          SigningAlgorithms -> (list)
              The signing algorithms that the KMS key supports. You cannot use
              the KMS key with other signing algorithms within KMS.

              This  field  appears  only  when  the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              SIGN_VERIFY .

              (string)

          MultiRegion -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the KMS key is a multi-Region (True )  or  re-
              gional (False ) key. This value is True for multi-Region primary
              and replica keys and False for regional KMS keys.

              For more information about multi-Region keys,  see  Multi-Region
              keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          MultiRegionConfiguration -> (structure)
              Lists  the  primary  and  replica keys in same multi-Region key.
              This field is present only when the  value  of  the  MultiRegion
              field is True .

              For  more  information  about  any  listed KMS key, use the  De-
              scribeKey operation.

              o MultiRegionKeyType indicates whether the KMS key is a  PRIMARY
                or REPLICA key.

              o PrimaryKey displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key.
                This field displays the current KMS key if it is  the  primary
                key.

              o ReplicaKeys  displays  the key ARNs and Regions of all replica
                keys. This field includes the current  KMS  key  if  it  is  a
                replica key.

              MultiRegionKeyType -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the KMS key is a PRIMARY or REPLICA key.

              PrimaryKey -> (structure)
                 Displays  the  key  ARN  and  Region of the primary key. This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is the primary key.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     Displays the key ARN of a primary or  replica  key  of  a
                     multi-Region key.

                 Region -> (string)
                     Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary or
                     replica key in a multi-Region key.

              ReplicaKeys -> (list)
                 displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica  keys.  This
                 field includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  primary  or replica key in a multi-Region
                     key.

                     Arn -> (string)
                        Displays the key ARN of a primary or replica key of  a
                        multi-Region key.

                     Region -> (string)
                        Displays  the  Amazon Web Services Region of a primary
                        or replica key in a multi-Region key.

          PendingDeletionWindowInDays -> (integer)
              The waiting period before the primary key in a multi-Region  key
              is  deleted.  This  waiting  period  begins when the last of its
              replica keys is deleted. This value is  present  only  when  the
              KeyState  of  the KMS key is PendingReplicaDeletion . That indi-
              cates that the KMS key is the primary key in a multi-Region key,
              it  is scheduled for deletion, and it still has existing replica
              keys.

              When a single-Region KMS key or a multi-Region  replica  key  is
              scheduled  for  deletion,  its deletion date is displayed in the
              DeletionDate field. However, when the primary key in a multi-Re-
              gion  key  is scheduled for deletion, its waiting period doesn't
              begin until all of its replica keys are deleted. This value dis-
              plays  that  waiting  period.  When  the last replica key in the
              multi-Region key is deleted, the KeyState of the scheduled  pri-
              mary  key changes from PendingReplicaDeletion to PendingDeletion
              and the deletion date appears in the DeletionDate field.

          MacAlgorithms -> (list)
              The message authentication code (MAC) algorithm  that  the  HMAC
              KMS key supports.

              This  value  is present only when the KeyUsage of the KMS key is
              GENERATE_VERIFY_MAC .

              (string)
