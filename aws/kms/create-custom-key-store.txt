CREATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                            CREATE-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       create-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a custom key store that is associated with an CloudHSM cluster
       that you own and manage.

       This operation is part of the custom key store feature feature in  KMS,
       which  combines  the  convenience and extensive integration of KMS with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

       Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the  required
       elements,  including an CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements
       for a custom key store. For details about the  required  elements,  see
       Assemble  the  Prerequisites  in  the  Key Management Service Developer
       Guide .

       When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new
       custom  key  store.  Before  you can use your new custom key store, you
       need to use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key
       store  to  its  CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your
       custom key store immediately, you might want to connect  it  to  verify
       that  all  settings  are  correct  and then disconnect it until you are
       ready to use it.

       For help with failures, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store  in  the
       Key Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:CreateCustomKeyStore (IAM policy).

SYNOPSIS
            create-custom-key-store
          --custom-key-store-name <value>
          [--cloud-hsm-cluster-id <value>]
          [--trust-anchor-certificate <value>]
          [--key-store-password <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-name (string)
          Specifies a friendly name for the custom key store. The name must be
          unique in your Amazon Web Services account.

       --cloud-hsm-cluster-id (string)
          Identifies  the CloudHSM cluster for the custom key store. Enter the
          cluster ID of any active CloudHSM cluster that is not already  asso-
          ciated  with  a  custom  key  store. To find the cluster ID, use the
          DescribeClusters operation.

       --trust-anchor-certificate (string)
          Enter the content of the trust anchor certificate for  the  cluster.
          This is the content of the customerCA.crt file that you created when
          you initialized the cluster .

       --key-store-password (string)
          Enter the password of the ` kmsuser  crypto  user  (CU)  account  <-
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-con-
          cepts.html#concept-kmsuser>`__ in the  specified  CloudHSM  cluster.
          KMS  logs  into  the  cluster as this user to manage key material on
          your behalf.

          The password must be a string of 7 to 32 characters.  Its  value  is
          case sensitive.

          This  parameter  tells KMS the kmsuser account password; it does not
          change the password in the CloudHSM cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a custom key store

       The  following  create-custom-key-store  example  creates  a custom key
       store backed by an AWS CloudHSM cluster.

       To specify the file input for the trust-anchor-certificate  command  in
       the AWS CLI, the file:// prefix is required.

          aws kms create-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-name ExampleKeyStore \
              --cloud-hsm-cluster-id cluster-1a23b4cdefg \
              --key-store-password kmsPswd \
              --trust-anchor-certificate file://customerCA.crt

       Output:

          {
              "CustomKeyStoreId": cks-1234567890abcdef0
          }

       For  more  information,  see Creating a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key
       Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       CustomKeyStoreId -> (string)
          A unique identifier for the new custom key store.
