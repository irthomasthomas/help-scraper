UPDATE-PRIMARY-REGION()                                UPDATE-PRIMARY-REGION()



NAME
       update-primary-region -

DESCRIPTION
       Changes the primary key of a multi-Region key.

       This  operation  changes  the  replica key in the specified Region to a
       primary key and changes the former primary key to a  replica  key.  For
       example,  suppose you have a primary key in us-east-1 and a replica key
       in eu-west-2 . If you  run  UpdatePrimaryRegion  with  a  PrimaryRegion
       value  of eu-west-2 , the primary key is now the key in eu-west-2 , and
       the key in us-east-1 becomes a replica key. For details,  see  Updating
       the primary Region in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       This  operation  supports  multi-Region keys , an KMS feature that lets
       you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Ser-
       vices  Regions.  Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key mate-
       rial, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably  to  encrypt
       data  in  one  Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different
       Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or  making  a
       cross-Region  call.  For  more information about multi-Region keys, see
       Multi-Region keys in KMS in the Key Management Service Developer  Guide
       .

       The primary key of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that
       are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key  mate-
       rial,  key  ID  ,  key  spec  ,  key  usage , key material origin , and
       automatic key rotation . It's the only key that can be replicated.  You
       cannot delete the primary key until all replica keys are deleted.

       The  key  ID  and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the
       replica key that will become the primary key. The primary  Region  must
       already have a replica key. This operation does not create a KMS key in
       the specified Region. To find the replica keys,  use  the   DescribeKey
       operation  on  the  primary key or any replica key. To create a replica
       key, use the  ReplicateKey operation.

       You can run this operation while using the affected  multi-Region  keys
       in  cryptographic  operations.  This operation should not delay, inter-
       rupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.

       Even after this operation completes, the process of updating  the  pri-
       mary  Region  might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Opera-
       tions such as DescribeKey might display both the old  and  new  primary
       keys  as  replicas.  The  old and new primary keys have a transient key
       state of Updating . The original key state is restored when the  update
       is  complete. While the key state is Updating , you can use the keys in
       cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary  key
       or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling
       these keys. For details about the Updating key state, see Key states of
       KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .

       This  operation  does not return any output. To verify that primary key
       is changed, use the  DescribeKey operation.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot use this operation in a different
          Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions :

       o kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion  on  the  current primary key (in the primary
         key's Region). Include this permission primary key's key policy.

       o kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the current replica key  (in  the  replica
         key's  Region). Include this permission in the replica key's key pol-
         icy.

          Eventual consistency : The KMS API follows an  eventual  consistency
          model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency .

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies  the  current  primary key. When the operation completes,
          this KMS key will be a replica key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of a multi-Region primary key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/mrk-1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --primary-region (string)
          The Amazon Web Services Region of the new primary key. Enter the Re-
          gion ID, such as us-east-1 or ap-southeast-2 . There must be an  ex-
          isting replica key in this Region.

          When  the  operation  completes, the multi-Region key in this Region
          will be the primary key.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       None
