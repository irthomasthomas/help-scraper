DISABLE-KEY()                                                    DISABLE-KEY()



NAME
       disable-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  state of a KMS key to disabled. This change temporarily pre-
       vents use of the KMS key for cryptographic operations .

       For more information about how key state affects the use of a KMS  key,
       see  Key  states  of KMS keys in the * Key Management Service Developer
       Guide * .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DisableKey (key policy)

          Related operations :  EnableKey

SYNOPSIS
            disable-key
          --key-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Identifies the KMS key to disable.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To temporarily disable a KMS key

       The following example uses the disable-key command to  disable  a  cus-
       tomer  managed  KMS  key.  To re-enable the KMS key, use the enable-key
       command.

          aws kms enable-key \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Enabling and Disabling Keys in  the  AWS  Key
       Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
