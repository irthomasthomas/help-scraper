DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                    DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       disconnect-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnects the custom key store from its backing key store. This oper-
       ation disconnects an CloudHSM key store from  its  associated  CloudHSM
       cluster  or  disconnects  an  external  key store from the external key
       store proxy that communicates with your external key manager.

       This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in  KMS,  which
       combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the iso-
       lation and control of a key store that you own and manage.

       While a custom key store is disconnected, you can manage the custom key
       store  and its KMS keys, but you cannot create or use its KMS keys. You
       can reconnect the custom key store at any time.

       NOTE:
          While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS
          keys  in  the  custom  key  store  or  to  use  existing KMS keys in
          cryptographic operations will fail. This action  can  prevent  users
          from storing and accessing sensitive data.

       When  you disconnect a custom key store, its ConnectionState changes to
       Disconnected . To find the connection state of a custom key store,  use
       the   DescribeCustomKeyStores  operation.  To  reconnect  a  custom key
       store, use the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a  cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Enter the ID of the custom key store you want to disconnect. To find
          the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disconnect a custom key store

       The  following disconnect-custom-key-store example disconnects a custom
       key store from its AWS CloudHSM cluster. You  might  disconnect  a  key
       store  to troubleshoot a problem, to update its settings, or to prevent
       KMS keys in the keystore from being used in cryptographic operations.

       This command is the same for  all  custom  key  stores,  including  AWS
       CloudHSM key stores and external key stores.

       Before  running  this  command, replace the example custom key store ID
       with a valid one.

          $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

       This command produces no output.  verify that the  command  was  effec-
       tive, use the describe-custom-key-stores command.

       Management Service Developer Guide.

       For  more  information  about  disconnecting an external key store, see

       agement Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
