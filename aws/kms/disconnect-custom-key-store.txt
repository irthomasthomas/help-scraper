DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()                    DISCONNECT-CUSTOM-KEY-STORE()



NAME
       disconnect-custom-key-store -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnects  the custom key store from its associated CloudHSM cluster.
       While a custom key store is disconnected, you can manage the custom key
       store  and  its  KMS keys, but you cannot create or use KMS keys in the
       custom key store. You can reconnect the custom key store at any time.

       NOTE:
          While a custom key store is disconnected, all attempts to create KMS
          keys  in  the  custom  key  store  or  to  use  existing KMS keys in
          cryptographic operations will fail. This action  can  prevent  users
          from storing and accessing sensitive data.

       To  find  the  connection  state  of  a  custom key store, use the  De-
       scribeCustomKeyStores operation. To reconnect a custom key  store,  use
       the  ConnectCustomKeyStore operation.

       If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

       This  operation is part of the custom key store feature feature in KMS,
       which combines the convenience and extensive integration  of  KMS  with
       the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.
          Cross-account  use : No. You cannot perform this operation on a cus-
          tom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:DisconnectCustomKeyStore (IAM policy)

OPTIONS
       --custom-key-store-id (string)
          Enter the ID of the custom key store you want to disconnect. To find
          the ID of a custom key store, use the  DescribeCustomKeyStores oper-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disconnect a custom key store

       The following disconnect-custom-key-store example disconnects a  custom
       key  store  from  its  AWS CloudHSM cluster. You might disconnect a key
       store to troubleshoot a problem, to update its settings, or to  prevent
       KMS keys in the keystore from being used in cryptographic operations.

       Before  running  this  command, replace the example custom key store ID
       with a valid one.

          $ aws kms disconnect-custom-key-store \
              --custom-key-store-id cks-1234567890abcdef0

       This command produces no output.  verify that the  command  was  effec-
       tive, use the describe-custom-key-stores command.

       For  more  information,  see  Connecting and disconnecting a custom key
       store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
