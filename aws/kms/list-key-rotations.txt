LIST-KEY-ROTATIONS()                                      LIST-KEY-ROTATIONS()



NAME
       list-key-rotations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about all completed key material rotations for the
       specified KMS key.

       You must specify the KMS key in all requests. You can  refine  the  key
       rotations list by limiting the number of rotations returned.

       For  detailed  information about automatic and on-demand key rotations,
       see Rotating KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide .
          Cross-account use : No. You cannot perform this operation on  a  KMS
          key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

          Required permissions : kms:ListKeyRotations (key policy)

          Related operations:

       o EnableKeyRotation

       o DisableKeyRotation

       o GetKeyRotationStatus

       o RotateKeyOnDemand
          Eventual  consistency  : The KMS API follows an eventual consistency
          model. For more information, see KMS eventual consistency .

       list-key-rotations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Rotations

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Gets the key rotations for the specified KMS key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about all completed key material rotations

       The following list-key-rotations example lists  information  about  all
       completed key material rotations for the specified KMS key.

          aws kms list-key-rotations \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       Output:

          {
              "Rotations": [
                  {
                      "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "RotationDate": "2024-03-02T10:11:36.564000+00:00",
                      "RotationType": "AUTOMATIC"
                  },
                  {
                      "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "RotationDate": "2024-04-05T15:14:47.757000+00:00",
                      "RotationType": "ON_DEMAND"
                  }
              ],
              "Truncated": false
          }

OUTPUT
       Rotations -> (list)
          A list of completed key material rotations.

          (structure)
              Contains information about completed key material rotations.

              KeyId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier of the key.

              RotationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time that the key material rotation completed.  For-
                 matted as Unix time.

              RotationType -> (string)
                 Identifies  whether the key material rotation was a scheduled
                 automatic rotation or an on-demand rotation .

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When Truncated is true, this element is  present  and  contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this value is true, the list in this response is truncated.  To  get
          more  items,  pass  the  value of the NextMarker element in this re-
          sponse to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
