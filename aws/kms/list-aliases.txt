LIST-ALIASES()                                                  LIST-ALIASES()



NAME
       list-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a list of aliases in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and
       region. For more information about aliases, see  CreateAlias .

       By default, the ListAliases operation returns all aliases  in  the  ac-
       count  and region. To get only the aliases associated with a particular
       KMS key, use the KeyId parameter.

       The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and asso-
       ciated  with  your  customer  managed keys, and aliases that Amazon Web
       Services created and associated with Amazon Web Services  managed  keys
       in  your account. You can recognize Amazon Web Services aliases because
       their names have the format aws/<service-name> , such as aws/dynamodb .

       The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId field.
       These  are  predefined aliases that Amazon Web Services has created but
       has not yet associated with a KMS key. Aliases that Amazon Web Services
       creates  in  your  account,  including predefined aliases, do not count
       against your KMS aliases quota .
          Cross-account use : No. ListAliases does not return aliases in other
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

          Required permissions : kms:ListAliases (IAM policy)

       For  details,  see  Controlling access to aliases in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

       list-aliases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: Aliases

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Lists  only  aliases that are associated with the specified KMS key.
          Enter a KMS key in your Amazon Web Services account.

          This parameter is optional. If you omit it, ListAliases returns  all
          aliases in the account and Region.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To  get  the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys or  De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all aliases in an AWS account and Region

       The following example uses the list-aliases command to list all aliases
       in the default Region of the AWS account. The output  includes  aliases
       associated with AWS managed KMS keys and customer managed KMS keys.

          aws kms list-aliases

       Output:

          {
              "Aliases": [
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/testKey",
                      "AliasName": "alias/testKey",
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/FinanceDept",
                      "AliasName": "alias/FinanceDept",
                      "TargetKeyId": "0987dcba-09fe-87dc-65ba-ab0987654321"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/aws/dynamodb",
                      "AliasName": "alias/aws/dynamodb",
                      "TargetKeyId": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
                  },
                  {
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/aws/ebs",
                      "AliasName": "alias/aws/ebs",
                      "TargetKeyId": "0987ab65-43cd-21ef-09ab-87654321cdef"
                  },
                  ...
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list all aliases for a particular KMS key

       The  following example uses the list-aliases command and its key-id pa-
       rameter to list all aliases that are associated with a  particular  KMS
       key.

       Each  alias is associated with only one KMS key, but a KMS key can have
       multiple aliases. This command is very useful because the AWS KMS  con-
       sole  lists  only one alias for each KMS key. To find all aliases for a
       KMS key, you must use the list-aliases command.

       This example uses the key ID of the KMS key for the --key-id parameter,
       but  you  can  use  a key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias ARN in this
       command.

          aws kms list-aliases --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       Output:

          {
              "Aliases": [
                  {
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/oregon-test-key",
                      "AliasName": "alias/oregon-test-key"
                  },
                  {
                      "TargetKeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
                      "AliasArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/project121-test",
                      "AliasName": "alias/project121-test"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Aliases -> (list)
          A list of aliases.

          (structure)
              Contains information about an alias.

              AliasName -> (string)
                 String that contains the alias. This value begins with alias/
                 .

              AliasArn -> (string)
                 String that contains the key ARN.

              TargetKeyId -> (string)
                 String that contains the key identifier of the KMS key  asso-
                 ciated with the alias.

              CreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time that the alias was most recently created in the
                 account and Region. Formatted as Unix time.

              LastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time that the alias  was  most  recently  associated
                 with  a  KMS key in the account and Region. Formatted as Unix
                 time.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When Truncated is true, this element is  present  and  contains  the
          value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.

       Truncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more items in the list. When
          this value is true, the list in this response is truncated.  To  get
          more items, pass the value of the NextMarker element in thisresponse
          to the Marker parameter in a subsequent request.
