GET-KEY-ROTATION-STATUS()                            GET-KEY-ROTATION-STATUS()



NAME
       get-key-rotation-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  detailed information about the rotation status for a KMS key,
       including whether automatic rotation of the key material is enabled for
       the specified KMS key, the rotation period , and the next scheduled ro-
       tation date.

       Automatic key rotation is supported only on  symmetric  encryption  KMS
       keys  .  You  cannot enable automatic rotation of asymmetric KMS keys ,
       HMAC KMS keys , KMS keys with imported key material , or KMS keys in  a
       custom  key store . To enable or disable automatic rotation of a set of
       related multi-Region keys , set the property on the primary key..

       You can enable ( EnableKeyRotation ) and disable automatic  rotation  (
       DisableKeyRotation  ) of the key material in customer managed KMS keys.
       Key material rotation of Amazon Web Services managed KMS  keys  is  not
       configurable.  KMS  always  rotates the key material in Amazon Web Ser-
       vices managed KMS keys every year. The key rotation status  for  Amazon
       Web Services managed KMS keys is always true .

       You can perform on-demand ( RotateKeyOnDemand ) rotation of the key ma-
       terial in customer managed KMS keys, regardless of whether or not auto-
       matic  key  rotation  is  enabled.  You can use GetKeyRotationStatus to
       identify the date and time that an in progress on-demand  rotation  was
       initiated.  You  can  use  ListKeyRotations to view the details of com-
       pleted rotations.

       NOTE:
          In May 2022, KMS changed the rotation schedule for Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  managed  keys  from  every three years to every year. For de-
          tails, see  EnableKeyRotation .

       The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key
       state.  For  details,  see Key states of KMS keys in the Key Management
       Service Developer Guide .

       o Disabled: The key rotation status does not change when you disable  a
         KMS  key. However, while the KMS key is disabled, KMS does not rotate
         the key material. When you re-enable the KMS key,  rotation  resumes.
         If  the key material in the re-enabled KMS key hasn't been rotated in
         one year, KMS rotates it immediately, and every year  thereafter.  If
         it's  been  less than a year since the key material in the re-enabled
         KMS key was rotated, the KMS key resumes its prior rotation schedule.

       o Pending deletion: While a KMS key is pending deletion, its key  rota-
         tion status is false and KMS does not rotate the key material. If you
         cancel the deletion, the original key rotation status returns to true
         .
          Cross-account use : Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a
          different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key  ARN  in  the
          value of the KeyId parameter.

OPTIONS
       --key-id (string)
          Gets the rotation status for the specified KMS key.

          Specify the key ID or key ARN of the KMS key. To specify a  KMS  key
          in  a  different  Amazon  Web Services account, you must use the key
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          To get the key ID and key ARN for a KMS key, use  ListKeys  or   De-
          scribeKey .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve the rotation status for a KMS key.

       The following get-key-rotation-status example returns information about
       the  rotation  status of the specified KMS key, including whether auto-
       matic rotation is enabled, the rotation period, and the next  scheduled
       rotation  date.  You  can use this command on customer managed KMS keys
       and AWS managed KMS keys. However, all AWS managed KMS keys  are  auto-
       matically rotated every year.

          aws kms get-key-rotation-status \
              --key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

       Output:

          {
              "KeyId": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab",
              "KeyRotationEnabled": true,
              "NextRotationDate": "2024-02-14T18:14:33.587000+00:00",
              "RotationPeriodInDays": 365
          }

       For  more information, see Rotating keys in the AWS Key Management Ser-
       vice Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       KeyRotationEnabled -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that specifies whether key rotation is enabled.

       KeyId -> (string)
          Identifies the specified symmetric encryption KMS key.

       RotationPeriodInDays -> (integer)
          The number of days between  each  automatic  rotation.  The  default
          value is 365 days.

       NextRotationDate -> (timestamp)
          The next date that KMS will automatically rotate the key material.

       OnDemandRotationStartDate -> (timestamp)
          Identifies  the date and time that an in progress on-demand rotation
          was initiated.

          The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model due  to  the  dis-
          tributed  nature of the system. As a result, there might be a slight
          delay between initiating on-demand key rotation and  the  rotation's
          completion. Once the on-demand rotation is complete, use  ListKeyRo-
          tations to view the details of the on-demand rotation.
