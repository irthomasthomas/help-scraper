OPTIONS
       --jobs (list)
          A list of up to 100 job IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a job

       The following describe-jobs example describes a job with the  specified
       job ID.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status for the job.

                 NOTE:
                     If your jobs don't progress to STARTING , see Jobs  stuck
                     in  RUNNABLE status in the troubleshooting section of the

                 A short, human-readable string to provide  more  details  for
                 the current status of the job.

                 o CAPACITY:INSUFFICIENT_INSTANCE_CAPACITY - All compute envi-
                   ronments have insufficient capacity to service the job.

                 o MISCONFIGURATION:COMPUTE_ENVIRONMENT_MAX_RESOURCE   -   All
                   compute environments have a maxVcpu setting that is smaller
                   than the job requirements.

                 o MISCONFIGURATION:JOB_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENT - All compute en-
                   vironments  have  no  connected instances that meet the job
                   requirements.

                 created. For non-array jobs and parent array  jobs,  this  is
                 when  the  job  entered the SUBMITTED state. This is specifi-
                 cally at the time SubmitJob was called. For array child jobs,
                 this  is when the child job was spawned by its parent and en-
                 tered the PENDING state.

              retryStrategy -> (structure)
                 The retry strategy to use for this job if an attempt fails.

                 attempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to move a job to the RUNNABLE status.
                     You  can  specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value
                     of attempts is greater than one, the job  is  retried  on
                     failure the same number of attempts as the value.

                 evaluateOnExit -> (list)
                     Array  of  up  to  5  objects that specify the conditions
                     where jobs are retried or failed. If  this  parameter  is
                     specified, then the attempts parameter must also be spec-
                     ified. If none of the listed conditions match,  then  the
                     job is retried.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies  an  array  of up to 5 conditions to be met,
                        and an action to take (RETRY or EXIT ) if  all  condi-
                        tions  are  met.  If none of the EvaluateOnExit condi-
                        tions in a RetryStrategy match, then the  job  is  re-
                        tried.

                        onStatusReason -> (string)
                            Contains  a glob pattern to match against the Sta-
                            tusReason returned for a job. The pattern can con-
                            tain up to 512 characters. It can contain letters,
                            numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white spaces
                            (including  spaces or tabs). It can optionally end
                            with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the
                            string needs to be an exact match.

                        onReason -> (string)
                            Contains  a glob pattern to match against the Rea-
                            son returned for a job. The pattern can contain up
                            to  512  characters.  It can contain letters, num-
                            bers, periods (.), colons  (:),  and  white  space
                            (including spaces and tabs). It can optionally end
                            with an asterisk (*) so that only the start of the
                            string needs to be an exact match.

                        onExitCode -> (string)
                            Contains a glob pattern to match against the deci-
                            mal representation of the ExitCode returned for  a
                            job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters long.
                            It can contain only numbers, and can end  with  an
                            asterisk  (*) so that only the start of the string
                            needs to be an exact match.

                            The string can contain up to 512 characters.

                        action -> (string)
                            Specifies the action to take if all of the  speci-
                            fied  conditions  (onStatusReason , onReason , and
                            onExitCode ) are met. The values aren't case  sen-
                            sitive.

              startedAt -> (long)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  (in  milliseconds) for when the job was
                 started. More specifically, it's when  the  job  transitioned
                 from the STARTING state to the RUNNING state.

              stoppedAt -> (long)
                 The  Unix  timestamp  (in  milliseconds) for when the job was
                 stopped. More specifically, it's when  the  job  transitioned
                 from the RUNNING state to a terminal state, such as SUCCEEDED
                 or FAILED .

              dependsOn -> (list)
                 A list of job IDs that this job depends on.

                 (structure)
                     An object that represents an Batch job dependency.

                     jobId -> (string)
                        The job ID of the Batch  job  that's  associated  with
                        this dependency.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of the job dependency.

              jobDefinition -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the job definition that
                 this job uses.

              parameters -> (map)
                 Additional parameters that are passed to the job that replace
                 parameter  substitution  placeholders  or override any corre-
                 sponding parameter defaults from the job definition.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              container -> (structure)
                 An object that  represents  the  details  for  the  container
                 that's associated with the job. If the details are for a mul-
                 tiple-container job, this object will be empty.

                 image -> (string)
                     The image used to start the container.

                 vcpus -> (integer)
                     The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. For  jobs
                     that  run  on  Amazon  EC2 resources, you can specify the
                     vCPU requirement for the job using resourceRequirements ,
                     but  you  can't specify the vCPU requirements in both the
                     vcpus and  resourceRequirements  object.  This  parameter
                     maps  to  CpuShares  in the Create a container section of
                     the Docker Remote API  and  the  --cpu-shares  option  to
                     docker run . Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares.
                     You must specify at least one vCPU. This is required  but
                     can  be specified in several places. It must be specified
                     for each node at least once.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  run  on
                        Fargate  resources.  For  jobs that run on Fargate re-
                        sources, you must specify the vCPU requirement for the
                        job using resourceRequirements .

                 memory -> (integer)
                     For  jobs  running  on  Amazon  EC2 resources that didn't
                     specify memory requirements using resourceRequirements  ,
                     the  number  of  MiB  of memory reserved for the job. For
                     other jobs, including all run on Fargate  resources,  see
                     resourceRequirements .

                 command -> (list)
                     The command that's passed to the container.

                     (string)

                 jobRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that's associated with the
                     job when run.

                 executionRoleArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that
                     Batch  can assume. For more information, see Batch execu-
                     tion IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                 volumes -> (list)
                     A list of volumes that are associated with the job.

                     (structure)
                        A data volume that's used in a job's container proper-
                        ties.

                        host -> (structure)
                            The  contents  of  the  host  parameter  determine
                            whether your data volume persists on the host con-
                            tainer instance and where it's stored. If the host
                            parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns
                            a  host  path  for  your data volume. However, the
                            data isn't guaranteed to persist  after  the  con-
                            tainers that are associated with it stop running.

                            NOTE:
                               This  parameter  isn't  applicable to jobs that
                               are running on Fargate resources and  shouldn't
                               be provided.

                            sourcePath -> (string)
                               The  path on the host container instance that's
                               presented to the container. If  this  parameter
                               is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a
                               host path for you. If this parameter contains a
                               file location, then the data volume persists at
                               the specified location on  the  host  container
                               instance  until  you delete it manually. If the
                               source path location doesn't exist on the  host
                               container  instance,  the Docker daemon creates
                               it. If the location does exist, the contents of
                               the source path folder are exported.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  parameter  isn't  applicable  to jobs
                                   that run on Fargate resources.  Don't  pro-
                                   vide this for these jobs.

                        name -> (string)
                            The  name of the volume. It can be up to 255 char-
                            acters long. It can contain uppercase  and  lower-
                            case  letters,  numbers,  hyphens  (-), and under-
                            scores  (_).  This  name  is  referenced  in   the
                            sourceVolume  parameter  of  container  definition
                            mountPoints .

                        efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                            This parameter is specified when you're  using  an
                            Amazon  Elastic  File  System  file system for job
                            storage. Jobs that  are  running  on  Fargate  re-
                            sources must specify a platformVersion of at least
                            1.4.0 .

                            fileSystemId -> (string)
                               The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                            rootDirectory -> (string)
                               The directory within the Amazon EFS file system
                               to mount as the root directory inside the host.
                               If this parameter is omitted, the root  of  the
                               Amazon EFS volume is used instead. Specifying /
                               has the same effect as omitting this parameter.
                               The maximum length is 4,096 characters.

                               WARNING:
                                   If  an EFS access point is specified in the
                                   authorizationConfig ,  the  root  directory
                                   parameter  must either be omitted or set to
                                   / , which enforces the path set on the Ama-
                                   zon EFS access point.

                            transitEncryption -> (string)
                               Determines  whether  to  enable  encryption for
                               Amazon EFS data in transit between  the  Amazon
                               ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. Transit en-
                               cryption must be enabled if Amazon EFS IAM  au-
                               thorization is used. If this parameter is omit-
                               ted, the default value of DISABLED is used. For
                               more  information, see Encrypting data in tran-

                            transitEncryptionPort -> (integer)
                               The port to use when sending encrypted data be-
                               tween the Amazon ECS host and  the  Amazon  EFS
                               server.  If you don't specify a transit encryp-
                               tion port, it uses the port selection  strategy
                               that  the  Amazon  EFS  mount  helper uses. The
                               value must be between 0 and  65,535.  For  more

                            authorizationConfig -> (structure)
                               The authorization configuration details for the
                               Amazon EFS file system.

                               accessPointId -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  EFS access point ID to use. If
                                   an access point is specified, the root  di-
                                   rectory  value  specified in the EFSVolume-
                                   Configuration must either be omitted or set
                                   to / which enforces the path set on the EFS
                                   access point. If an access point  is  used,
                                   transit  encryption  must be enabled in the

                               type="GPU"

                            The number of physical GPUs  to  reserve  for  the
                            container.  Make  sure that the number of GPUs re-
                            served for all containers in a job doesn't  exceed
                            the  number  of  available GPUs on the compute re-
                            source that the job is launched on.

                            NOTE:
                               GPUs aren't available for jobs that are running
                               on Fargate resources.

                            tainer. This parameter is supported for jobs  that
                            are  running on Amazon EC2 resources. If your con-
                            tainer attempts to exceed  the  memory  specified,
                            the  container  is terminated. This parameter maps
                            to Memory in the Create a container section of the
                            Docker  Remote  API  and  the  --memory  option to
                            docker run . You must specify at least  4  MiB  of
                            memory  for  a  job.  This  is required but can be
                            specified in several places for multi-node  paral-
                            lel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node
                            at least once. This parameter maps  to  Memory  in
                            the  Create  a container section of the Docker Re-
                            mote API and the --memory option to docker run .

                            NOTE:
                               If you're trying to maximize your resource uti-
                               lization  by providing your jobs as much memory
                               as possible for a particular instance type, see
                               Memory management in the Batch User Guide .

                            --cpu-shares  option  to docker run . Each vCPU is
                            equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For Amazon EC2 re-
                            sources,  you must specify at least one vCPU. This
                            is  required  but  can  be  specified  in  several
                            places;  it  must  be  specified  for each node at

                            then value must match one of the supported  values
                            and  the  MEMORY  values must be one of the values
                            supported for that VCPU value. The supported  val-

                        Any of the host devices to expose  to  the  container.
                        This  parameter  maps  to Devices in the Create a con-
                        tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the  --de-
                        vice option to docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are
                            running on Fargate resources. Don't provide it for
                            these jobs.

                        (structure)
                            An  object  that  represents  a container instance
                            host device.

                            NOTE:
                               This object isn't applicable to jobs  that  are

                            containerPath -> (string)
                               The  path  inside  the container that's used to
                               expose the host device. By default,  the  host-
                               Path value is used.

                            permissions -> (list)
                               The explicit permissions to provide to the con-
                               tainer for the device.  By  default,  the  con-
                               tainer  has  permissions for read , write , and
                               mknod for the device.

                               (string)

                     initProcessEnabled -> (boolean)
                        If true, run an init process inside the container that
                        forwards  signals  and reaps processes. This parameter
                        maps to the --init option to docker run . This parame-
                        ter  requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or
                        greater on  your  container  instance.  To  check  the
                        Docker  Remote API version on your container instance,
                        log in to your container instance and run the  follow-
                        ing  command:  sudo  docker version | grep "Server API
                        version"

                     sharedMemorySize -> (integer)
                        The value for the size (in MiB) of the  /dev/shm  vol-
                        ume.  This  parameter maps to the --shm-size option to
                        docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are
                            running on Fargate resources. Don't provide it for
                            these jobs.

                     tmpfs -> (list)
                        The container path, mount options, and size  (in  MiB)
                        of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the --tmpfs
                        option to docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are

                            parameter for this resource type.

                        (structure)
                            The container path, mount options, and size of the
                            tmpfs mount.

                            NOTE:

                            containerPath -> (string)
                               The absolute file path in the  container  where
                               the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                            size -> (integer)
                               The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                            mountOptions -> (list)
                               The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                               Valid  values:  "defaults  "  | "ro " | "rw " |

                               (string)

                     maxSwap -> (integer)
                        The  total  amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container
                        can use. This parameter is translated  to  the  --mem-
                        ory-swap  option  to docker run where the value is the
                        sum of the container memory plus  the  maxSwap  value.
                        For  more  information, see ` --memory-swap details <-
                        https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/re-
                        source_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__  in  the
                        Docker documentation.

                        If a maxSwap value of 0 is  specified,  the  container
                        doesn't  use  swap. Accepted values are 0 or any posi-
                        tive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the
                        container  doesn't  use the swap configuration for the
                        container instance that it's  running  on.  A  maxSwap
                        value  must  be set for the swappiness parameter to be
                        used.

                        NOTE:
                            This parameter isn't applicable to jobs  that  are
                            running on Fargate resources. Don't provide it for
                            these jobs.

                     swappiness -> (integer)
                        You can use this parameter to tune a container's  mem-
                        ory  swappiness  behavior.  A  swappiness  value  of 0
                        causes swapping to not occur unless absolutely  neces-
                        sary.  A  swappiness  value  of 100 causes pages to be
                        swapped aggressively. Valid values are  whole  numbers
                        between  0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn't
                        specified, a default value of 60 is used. If  a  value
                        isn't  specified  for maxSwap , then this parameter is
                        ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn't
                        use  swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappi-
                        ness option to docker run .

                        Consider the following when you  use  a  per-container
                        swap configuration.

                        o Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the con-
                          tainer instance for the containers to use.

                        NOTE:
                            By default, the Amazon ECS  optimized  AMIs  don't
                            have swap enabled. You must enable swap on the in-
                            stance to use this feature. For more  information,
                            see  Instance store swap volumes in the Amazon EC2
                            User Guide for Linux Instances or How do  I  allo-
                            cate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2
                            instance by using a swap file?

                        o The swap space parameters are only supported for job
                          definitions using EC2 resources.

                        o If the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted
                          from a job definition, each container has a  default
                          swappiness value of 60. Moreover, the total swap us-
                          age is limited to two times the  memory  reservation
                          of the container.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are
                            running on Fargate resources. Don't provide it for
                            these jobs.

                 logConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The log configuration specification for the container.

                     This  parameter  maps  to  LogConfig in the Create a con-
                     tainer  section  of  the  Docker  Remote  API   and   the
                     --log-driver  option to docker run . By default, contain-
                     ers use the same logging driver that  the  Docker  daemon
                     uses.  However,  the container might use a different log-
                     ging driver than the Docker daemon by  specifying  a  log
                     driver  with  this parameter in the container definition.
                     To use a different logging driver for  a  container,  the
                     log  system  must be configured properly on the container
                     instance. Or, alternatively, it must be configured  on  a
                     different log server for remote logging options. For more
                     information on the options for  different  supported  log
                     drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker doc-
                     umentation.

                     NOTE:
                        Batch currently supports a subset of the logging driv-
                        ers  available  to  the  Docker  daemon  (shown in the
                        LogConfiguration data type).  Additional  log  drivers
                        might  be  available  in future releases of the Amazon
                        ECS container agent.

                     This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote
                     API  or  greater on your container instance. To check the
                     Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log
                     in  to your container instance and run the following com-
                     mand: sudo docker version | grep "Server API version"

                     NOTE:
                        The Amazon ECS container agent running on a  container
                        instance  must  register the logging drivers available
                        on that instance with the  ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIV-
                        ERS  environment  variable before containers placed on
                        that instance can use these log configuration options.

                        configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container  Service
                        Developer Guide .

                     logDriver -> (string)
                        The  log  driver  to  use for the container. The valid
                        values that are listed  for  this  parameter  are  log

                            vices Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                            NOTE:
                               If the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  Pa-
                               rameter  Store parameter exists in the same Re-
                               gion as the job you're launching, then you  can
                               use  either the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                               or name of the parameter. If the parameter  ex-
                               ists  in  a different Region, then the full ARN
                               must be specified.

                 networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The network configuration for jobs that  are  running  on
                     Fargate  resources.  Jobs  that are running on Amazon EC2
                     resources must not specify this parameter.

                     assignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Indicates whether the job has a public IP address. For
                        a job that's running on Fargate resources in a private
                        subnet to send outbound traffic to the  internet  (for
                        example, to pull container images), the private subnet
                        requires a NAT gateway be attached to  route  requests
                        to  the internet. For more information, see Amazon ECS
                        task networking in the Amazon Elastic  Container  Ser-
                        vice  Developer Guide . The default value is "DISABLED
                        ".

                 fargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The platform configuration for jobs that are  running  on
                     Fargate  resources.  Jobs  that are running on Amazon EC2
                     resources must not specify this parameter.

                     platformVersion -> (string)
                        The Fargate platform version where the jobs  are  run-
                        ning.  A  platform  version is specified only for jobs
                        that are running on Fargate resources.  If  one  isn't
                        specified,  the LATEST platform version is used by de-
                        fault. This uses a recent,  approved  version  of  the
                        Fargate  platform  for compute resources. For more in-
                        formation, see Fargate platform versions in the Amazon
                        Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .

                 ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
                     The  amount  of ephemeral storage allocated for the task.
                     This parameter is used to  expand  the  total  amount  of
                     ephemeral  storage  available, beyond the default amount,
                     for tasks hosted on Fargate.

                     sizeInGiB -> (integer)
                        The total amount, in GiB, of ephemeral storage to  set
                        for  the  task.  The minimum supported value is 21 GiB
                        and the maximum supported value is 200 GiB.

                 runtimePlatform -> (structure)
                     An object that represents the compute environment  archi-
                     tecture for Batch jobs on Fargate.

                     operatingSystemFamily -> (string)

                        DOWS_SERVER_2022_FULL .

                        NOTE:
                            The  following  parameters cant be set for Windows
                            containers: linuxParameters , privileged , user  ,
                            ulimits  , readonlyRootFilesystem , and efsVolume-
                            Configuration .

                        NOTE:
                            The Batch Scheduler checks  the  compute  environ-
                            ments  that  are  attached to the job queue before
                            registering a task  definition  with  Fargate.  In
                            this  scenario,  the job queue is where the job is
                            submitted. If the job requires a Windows container
                            and  the  first compute environment is LINUX , the
                            compute environment is skipped and the  next  com-
                            pute  environment is checked until a Windows-based
                            compute environment is found.

                        NOTE:
                            Fargate Spot is not supported for ARM64  and  Win-
                            dows-based containers on Fargate. A job queue will
                            be blocked if a Fargate ARM64 or  Windows  job  is
                            submitted  to  a  job queue with only Fargate Spot
                            compute environments. However, you can attach both
                            FARGATE  and  FARGATE_SPOT compute environments to
                            the same job queue.

                     cpuArchitecture -> (string)
                        The vCPU architecture. The default value is  X86_64  .
                        Valid values are X86_64 and ARM64 .

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  must be set to X86_64 for Windows
                            containers.

                        NOTE:
                            Fargate Spot is not supported for ARM64  and  Win-
                            dows-based containers on Fargate. A job queue will
                            be blocked if a Fargate ARM64 or  Windows  job  is
                            submitted  to  a  job queue with only Fargate Spot
                            compute environments. However, you can attach both
                            FARGATE  and  FARGATE_SPOT compute environments to
                            the same job queue.

                 repositoryCredentials -> (structure)

                        ing the private repository credentials.

              nodeDetails -> (structure)
                 An  object that represents the details of a node that's asso-
                 ciated with a multi-node parallel job.

                 nodeIndex -> (integer)
                     The node index for the node. Node index numbering  starts
                     at  zero.  This  index is also available on the node with
                     the AWS_BATCH_JOB_NODE_INDEX environment variable.

                 isMainNode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the current node is the main node for a
                     multi-node parallel job.

              nodeProperties -> (structure)
                 An object that represents the node properties of a multi-node
                 parallel job.

                 NOTE:
                     This isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
                     resources.

                 numNodes -> (integer)
                     The number of nodes that are associated with a multi-node
                     parallel job.

                 mainNode -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  node  index  for  the  main  node  of   a
                     multi-node  parallel  job.  This node index value must be
                     fewer than the number of nodes.

                 nodeRangeProperties -> (list)
                     A list of node ranges and their properties that are asso-
                     ciated with a multi-node parallel job.

                     (structure)
                        This  is  an  object that represents the properties of
                        the node range for a multi-node parallel job.

                        targetNodes -> (string)
                            The range of nodes, using  node  index  values.  A
                            range  of 0:3 indicates nodes with index values of
                            0 through 3 . If the starting range value is omit-
                            ted  (:n  ), then 0 is used to start the range. If
                            the ending range value is omitted (n: ), then  the
                            highest  possible  node  index  is used to end the
                            range. Your accumulative node ranges must  account
                            for  all  nodes  (0:n  ). You can nest node ranges
                            (for example, 0:10 and 4:5 ). In  this  case,  the
                            4:5 range properties override the 0:10 properties.

                        container -> (structure)
                            The container details for the node range.

                            image -> (string)
                               Required.  The image used to start a container.
                               This string is passed directly  to  the  Docker
                               daemon.  Images  in the Docker Hub registry are
                               available by default.  Other  repositories  are
                               specified with `` repository-url /image :tag ``
                               . It can be 255 characters long. It can contain
                               uppercase  and  lowercase letters, numbers, hy-
                               phens (-), underscores (_), colons (:), periods
                               (.), forward slashes (/), and number signs (#).
                               This parameter maps to Image in  the  Create  a
                               container  section of the Docker Remote API and
                               the IMAGE parameter of docker run .

                               NOTE:
                                   Docker image architecture  must  match  the
                                   processor  architecture  of the compute re-
                                   sources that they're scheduled on. For  ex-
                                   ample, ARM-based Docker images can only run
                                   on ARM-based compute resources.

                               o Images in Amazon ECR Public repositories  use
                                 the  full  registry/repository[:tag]  or reg-
                                 istry/repository[@digest] naming conventions.
                                 For example,
                                 ``
                                 public.ecr.aws/registry_alias     /my-web-app
                                 :latest `` .

                               System  Message:  WARNING/2  (<string>:,   line
                               2372)

                                 end-string.

                               o Images in Amazon  ECR  repositories  use  the
                                 full  registry  and repository URI (for exam-
                                 ple,  123456789012.dkr.ecr.<region-name>.ama-
                                 zonaws.com/<repository-name> ).

                               o Images in official repositories on Docker Hub
                                 use a single name  (for  example,  ubuntu  or
                                 mongo ).

                               o Images  in  other  repositories on Docker Hub
                                 are qualified with an organization name  (for
                                 example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

                               o Images in other online repositories are qual-
                                 ified further by a domain name (for  example,
                                 quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu ).

                            vcpus -> (integer)
                               This   parameter   is   deprecated,   use   re-
                               sourceRequirements to specify the vCPU require-
                               ments  for  the  job  definition. It's not sup-
                               ported for jobs running on  Fargate  resources.
                               For  jobs  running  on Amazon EC2 resources, it
                               specifies the number of vCPUs reserved for  the
                               job.

                               Each  vCPU  is  equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares.
                               This parameter maps to CpuShares in the  Create
                               a  container  section  of the Docker Remote API
                               and the --cpu-shares option to docker run . The
                               number  of  vCPUs  must be specified but can be
                               specified in several places. You  must  specify
                               it at least once for each node.

                            memory -> (integer)
                               This   parameter   is   deprecated,   use   re-
                               sourceRequirements to specify  the  memory  re-
                               quirements  for  the  job  definition. It's not
                               supported  for  jobs  running  on  Fargate  re-
                               sources.  For  jobs  that run on Amazon EC2 re-
                               sources, it specifies the memory hard limit (in
                               MiB)  for  a  container.  If your container at-
                               tempts to exceed  the  specified  number,  it's
                               terminated.  You must specify at least 4 MiB of
                               memory for a job using this parameter. The mem-
                               ory  hard  limit  can  be  specified in several
                               places. It must be specified for each  node  at
                               least once.

                            command -> (list)
                               The  command  that's  passed  to the container.
                               This parameter maps to Cmd in the Create a con-
                               tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the
                               COMMAND parameter to docker run . For more  in-

                               (string)

                            jobRoleArn -> (string)
                               The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role
                               that the container can assume  for  Amazon  Web
                               Services permissions. For more information, see
                               IAM roles for tasks in the Amazon Elastic  Con-

                            executionRoleArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution
                               role that Batch can assume. For jobs  that  run
                               on  Fargate resources, you must provide an exe-
                               cution role. For more  information,  see  Batch
                               execution IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

                            volumes -> (list)
                               A list of data volumes used in a job.

                               (structure)
                                   A  data  volume that's used in a job's con-
                                   tainer properties.

                                   host -> (structure)
                                      The contents of the host  parameter  de-
                                      termine  whether  your  data volume per-
                                      sists on the host container instance and
                                      where it's stored. If the host parameter
                                      is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns
                                      a  host  path for your data volume. How-
                                      ever, the data isn't guaranteed to  per-
                                      sist after the containers that are asso-
                                      ciated with it stop running.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This parameter isn't  applicable  to
                                          jobs that are running on Fargate re-
                                          sources and shouldn't be provided.

                                      sourcePath -> (string)
                                          The path on the host  container  in-
                                          stance  that's presented to the con-
                                          tainer. If this parameter is  empty,
                                          then  the Docker daemon has assigned
                                          a host path for you. If this parame-
                                          ter  contains  a file location, then
                                          the  data  volume  persists  at  the
                                          specified  location on the host con-
                                          tainer instance until you delete  it
                                          manually.  If  the source path loca-
                                          tion doesn't exist on the host  con-
                                          tainer  instance,  the Docker daemon
                                          creates it. If the location does ex-
                                          ist, the contents of the source path
                                          folder are exported.

                                          NOTE:
                                             This parameter  isn't  applicable
                                             to  jobs  that run on Fargate re-
                                             sources. Don't provide  this  for
                                             these jobs.

                                   name -> (string)
                                      The  name of the volume. It can be up to
                                      255 characters long. It can contain  up-
                                      percase  and lowercase letters, numbers,
                                      hyphens (-), and underscores  (_).  This
                                      name  is  referenced in the sourceVolume
                                      parameter of container definition mount-
                                      Points .

                                   efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                                      This  parameter is specified when you're
                                      using an Amazon Elastic File System file
                                      system  for  job  storage. Jobs that are
                                      running on Fargate resources must  spec-
                                      ify  a platformVersion of at least 1.4.0
                                      .

                                      fileSystemId -> (string)
                                          The Amazon EFS  file  system  ID  to
                                          use.

                                      rootDirectory -> (string)
                                          The  directory within the Amazon EFS
                                          file system to mount as the root di-

                                   run  where the value is the sum of the con-

                                   If  a  maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the
                                   container doesn't use swap. Accepted values
                                   are  0  or  any  positive  integer.  If the
                                   maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container
                                   doesn't  use the swap configuration for the
                                   container instance that it's running on.  A
                                   maxSwap  value  must be set for the swappi-

                               swappiness -> (integer)
                                   You can use this parameter to tune  a  con-
                                   tainer's   memory  swappiness  behavior.  A
                                   swappiness value of 0  causes  swapping  to
                                   not  occur  unless  absolutely necessary. A
                                   swappiness value of 100 causes pages to  be
                                   swapped   aggressively.  Valid  values  are
                                   whole numbers between 0 and 100  .  If  the
                                   swappiness parameter isn't specified, a de-
                                   fault value of 60 is used. If a value isn't
                                   specified for maxSwap , then this parameter
                                   is ignored. If maxSwap is  set  to  0,  the
                                   container  doesn't use swap. This parameter
                                   maps to the --memory-swappiness  option  to
                                   docker run .

                                   Consider  the  following  when  you  use  a
                                   per-container swap configuration.

                                   o Swap space must be enabled and  allocated
                                     on  the  container  instance for the con-
                                     tainers to use.

                                   NOTE:
                                      By default,  the  Amazon  ECS  optimized
                                      AMIs  don't  have swap enabled. You must
                                      enable swap on the instance to use  this

                                     are  omitted  from a job definition, each
                                     container has a default swappiness  value
                                     of  60. Moreover, the total swap usage is
                                     limited to two times the memory  reserva-
                                     tion of the container.

                               that the Docker daemon uses. However  the  con-
                               tainer  might  use  a  different logging driver
                               than the Docker  daemon  by  specifying  a  log

                                   NOTE:
                                      The Batch Scheduler checks  the  compute
                                      environments  that  are  attached to the

                                      inition  with Fargate. In this scenario,
                                      the job queue is where the job  is  sub-
                                      mitted.  If  the  job requires a Windows
                                      container and the first compute environ-
                                      ment  is LINUX , the compute environment
                                      is skipped and the next compute environ-
                                      ment  is  checked  until a Windows-based
                                      compute environment is found.

                                   NOTE:
                                      Fargate Spot is not supported for  ARM64
                                      and Windows-based containers on Fargate.
                                      A job queue will be blocked if a Fargate

                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      This parameter must be set to X86_64 for
                                      Windows containers.

                                                 using  a  non-root  user  for
                                                 better security.

                                             You can specify  the  user  using
                                             the  following formats. If speci-

                                   ephemeralStorage -> (structure)
                                      The amount of ephemeral storage to allo-
                                      cate for the  task.  This  parameter  is
                                      used  to  expand  the  total  amount  of
                                      ephemeral storage available, beyond  the
                                      default amount, for tasks hosted on Far-
                                      gate.

                                      sizeInGiB -> (integer)

                                          task. The minimum supported value is
                                          21  GiB  and  the  maximum supported
                                          value is 200 GiB.

                                   executionRoleArn -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      execution  role  that  Batch can assume.
                                      For jobs that run on Fargate  resources,
                                      you  must provide an execution role. For
                                      more information,  see  Batch  execution

                                   platformVersion -> (string)
                                      The  Fargate  platform version where the
                                      jobs are running. A platform version  is
                                      specified only for jobs that are running
                                      on Fargate resources. If one isn't spec-
                                      ified,  the  LATEST  platform version is
                                      used by default. This uses a recent, ap-

                                   ipcMode -> (string)
                                      The  IPC  resource  namespace to use for
                                      the containers in the  task.  The  valid
                                      values are host , task , or none .

                                      If  host  is  specified,  all containers
                                      within the tasks that specified the host
                                      IPC  mode on the same container instance
                                      share the same IPC  resources  with  the
                                      host Amazon EC2 instance.

                                      If  task  is  specified,  all containers
                                      within the specified task share the same
                                      IPC resources.

                                      If  none is specified, the IPC resources
                                      within the containers of a task are pri-
                                      vate, and are not shared with other con-
                                      tainers in a task or  on  the  container
                                      instance.

                                      If  no  value is specified, then the IPC
                                      resource namespace  sharing  depends  on
                                      the  Docker  daemon  setting on the con-
                                      tainer instance. For  more  information,

                                   taskRoleArn -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)  that's
                                      associated with the Amazon ECS task.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This  is  object  is  comparable  to

                                   pidMode -> (string)
                                      The process namespace  to  use  for  the
                                      containers in the task. The valid values
                                      are host or task . For example, monitor-
                                      ing  sidecars  might need pidMode to ac-
                                      cess information about other  containers
                                      running in the same task.

                                      If  host  is  specified,  all containers
                                      within the tasks that specified the host
                                      PID  mode on the same container instance
                                      share the  process  namespace  with  the
                                      host Amazon EC2 instance.

                                      If  task  is  specified,  all containers
                                      within the specified task share the same
                                      process namespace.

                                      If no value is specified, the default is
                                      a private namespace for each  container.

                                      have multiple labels, but each key  must
                                      be unique for a given object.

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (string)

                               shareProcessNamespace -> (boolean)
                                   Indicates  if  the processes in a container

              arrayProperties -> (structure)
                 The array properties of the job, if it's an array job.

                 statusSummary -> (map)
                     A  summary  of  the  number of array job children in each
                     available job status. This parameter is returned for par-
                     ent array jobs.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

                 size -> (integer)
                     The size of the array job. This parameter is returned for
                     parent array jobs.

                 index -> (integer)
                     The job index within the  array  that's  associated  with
                     this  job. This parameter is returned for array job chil-
                     dren.

              timeout -> (structure)
                 The timeout configuration for the job.

                 attemptDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     The job timeout time (in seconds)  that's  measured  from
                     the  job  attempt's  startedAt timestamp. After this time
                     passes, Batch terminates your jobs if  they  aren't  fin-
                     ished. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

                     For  array  jobs,  the timeout applies to the child jobs,
                     not to the parent array job.

                     For multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs, the  timeout  applies
                     to the whole job, not to the individual nodes.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags that are applied to the job.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              propagateTags -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  to propagate the tags from the job or job
                 definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no  value
                 is  specified,  the  tags aren't propagated. Tags can only be
                 propagated to the tasks when the tasks are created. For  tags
                 with the same name, job tags are given priority over job def-
                 initions tags. If the total number of combined tags from  the
                 job  and  job  definition is over 50, the job is moved to the
                 FAILED state.

              platformCapabilities -> (list)
                 The platform capabilities required by the job definition.  If
                 no  value is specified, it defaults to EC2 . Jobs run on Far-
                 gate resources specify FARGATE .

                 (string)

              eksProperties -> (structure)
                 An object with various properties that are specific to Amazon
                 EKS based jobs.

                 podProperties -> (structure)
                     The properties for the Kubernetes pod resources of a job.

                     serviceAccountName -> (string)
                        The name of the service account that's used to run the
                        pod. For more information, see Kubernetes service  ac-
                        counts  and  Configure a Kubernetes service account to
                        assume an IAM role in the Amazon EKS  User  Guide  and
                        Configure  service accounts for pods in the Kubernetes
                        documentation .

                     hostNetwork -> (boolean)
                        Indicates if the pod uses the hosts'  network  IP  ad-
                        dress.  The  default  value  is true . Setting this to
                        false enables the  Kubernetes  pod  networking  model.
                        Most Batch workloads are egress-only and don't require
                        the overhead of IP allocation for each pod for  incom-
                        ing  connections. For more information, see Host name-
                        spaces and Pod networking in the Kubernetes documenta-
                        tion .

                        The DNS policy for the pod. The default value is Clus-
                        terFirst . If the hostNetwork parameter is not  speci-
                        fied,  the  default is ClusterFirstWithHostNet . Clus-
                        terFirst indicates that any DNS query  that  does  not
                        match  the  configured  cluster  domain suffix is for-
                        warded to the upstream nameserver inherited  from  the
                        node.  If  no value was specified for dnsPolicy in the
                        RegisterJobDefinition API  operation,  then  no  value
                        will   be   returned   for   dnsPolicy  by  either  of
                        DescribeJobDefinitions or DescribeJobs API operations.
                        The  pod spec setting will contain either ClusterFirst
                        or ClusterFirstWithHostNet , depending on the value of
                        the  hostNetwork  parameter. For more information, see
                        Pod's DNS policy in the Kubernetes documentation .

                        Valid values: Default | ClusterFirst  |  ClusterFirst-
                        WithHostNet

                        Displays  the  reference pointer to the Kubernetes se-
                        cret resource. These secrets help to  gain  access  to
                        pull an images from a private registry.

                        (structure)
                            References a Kubernetes secret resource. This name
                            of the secret must start and end with an  alphanu-
                            meric  character, is required to be lowercase, can
                            include periods (.) and  hyphens  (-),  and  can't

                               agePullSecret . This object  is  required  when
                               EksPodProperties$imagePullSecrets is used.

                     containers -> (list)
                        The  properties  of  the  container that's used on the

                               specified, the default name "Default " is used.
                               Each container in a  pod  must  have  a  unique
                               name.

                            image -> (string)
                               The Docker image used to start the container.

                               Never  .  This  parameter defaults to Always if
                               the :latest tag is specified, IfNotPresent oth-
                               erwise.  For more information, see Updating im-
                               ages in the Kubernetes documentation .

                            command -> (list)
                               The entrypoint for the container. For more  in-
                               formation,  see  Entrypoint  in  the Kubernetes
                               documentation .

                               (string)

                            args -> (list)
                               An array of arguments  to  the  entrypoint.  If
                               this  isn't specified, the CMD of the container
                               image is used. This  corresponds  to  the  args
                               member  in the Entrypoint portion of the Pod in
                               Kubernetes. Environment variable references are
                               expanded using the container's environment.

                               If  the referenced environment variable doesn't
                               exist,  the  reference  in  the  command  isn't
                               changed.  For  example,  if the reference is to
                               "$(NAME1) " and the NAME1 environment  variable
                               doesn't  exist,  the command string will remain
                               "$(NAME1) ". $$ is replaced with $ and the  re-
                               sulting  string  isn't  expanded.  For example,
                               $$(VAR_NAME) is passed as  $(VAR_NAME)  whether
                               or  not  the  VAR_NAME environment variable ex-
                               ists. For more information, see Dockerfile ref-

                               (string)

                            env -> (list)
                               The environment variables to  pass  to  a  con-

                                   terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB
                                   of memory for a job. memory can  be  speci-
                                   fied  in  limits  ,  requests , or both. If
                                   memory is specified in  both  places,  then
                                   the  value  that's specified in limits must
                                   be equal to the value that's  specified  in
                                   requests .

                                      To  maximize  your resource utilization,
                                      provide your jobs with as much memory as
                                      possible  for the specific instance type
                                      that you are using. To  learn  how,  see

                               The  name  of  the container. If the name isn't
                               specified, the default name "Default " is used.
                               Each  container  in  a  pod  must have a unique
                               name.

                            image -> (string)
                               The Docker image used to start the container.

                            imagePullPolicy -> (string)
                               The image pull policy for the  container.  Sup-

                               (string)

                            args -> (list)
                               An  array  of  arguments  to the entrypoint. If
                               this isn't specified, the CMD of the  container
                               image  is  used.  This  corresponds to the args
                               member in the Entrypoint portion of the Pod  in
                               Kubernetes. Environment variable references are
                               expanded using the container's environment.

                               If the referenced environment variable  doesn't
                               exist,  the  reference  in  the  command  isn't
                               changed. For example, if the  reference  is  to
                               "$(NAME1)  " and the NAME1 environment variable
                               doesn't exist, the command string  will  remain
                               "$(NAME1)  ". $$ is replaced with $ and the re-
                               sulting string  isn't  expanded.  For  example,
                               $$(VAR_NAME)  is  passed as $(VAR_NAME) whether
                               or not the VAR_NAME  environment  variable  ex-
                               ists. For more information, see Dockerfile ref-

                                   terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB
                                   of  memory  for a job. memory can be speci-
                                   fied in limits , requests  ,  or  both.  If
                                   memory  is  specified  in both places, then
                                   the value that's specified in  limits  must
                                   be  equal  to the value that's specified in

                                   When this parameter is specified, the  con-
                                   tainer is run as the specified user ID (uid
                                   ). If this parameter isn't  specified,  the
                                   default is the user that's specified in the
                                   image  metadata.  This  parameter  maps  to
                                   RunAsUser and MustRanAs policy in the Users
                                   and groups pod security policies in the Ku-

                               dependsOn -> (list)
                                   A list of containers  that  this  container
                                   depends on.

                                   (structure)
                                      A  list of containers that this task de-
                                      pends on.

                                      containerName -> (string)
                                          A unique  identifier  for  the  con-
                                          tainer.

                                      condition -> (string)
                                          The dependency condition of the con-
                                          tainer. The following are the avail-
                                          able conditions and their behavior:

                                          o START  -  This  condition emulates
                                            the behavior of links and  volumes
                                            today.  It validates that a depen-
                                            dent container is  started  before
                                            permitting   other  containers  to
                                            start.

                                          o COMPLETE -  This  condition  vali-
                                            dates  that  a dependent container
                                            runs to completion (exits)  before
                                            permitting   other  containers  to
                                            start.  This  can  be  useful  for
                                            nonessential containers that run a
                                            script and then exit. This  condi-
                                            tion  can't be set on an essential
                                            container.

                                          o SUCCESS - This  condition  is  the
                                            same as COMPLETE , but it also re-
                                            quires that  the  container  exits
                                            with a zero status. This condition
                                            can't be set on an essential  con-
                                            tainer.

                               environment -> (list)
                                   The environment variables to pass to a con-
                                   tainer. This parameter maps to Env  in  the
                                   Create  a  container  section of the Docker
                                   Remote API and the --env option  to  docker

                                   (structure)
                                      A key-value pair object.

                                      name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the key-value pair. For
                                          environment variables, this  is  the
                                          name of the environment variable.

                                      value -> (string)
                                          The value of the key-value pair. For
                                          environment variables, this  is  the
                                          value of the environment variable.

                               essential -> (boolean)
                                   If  the  essential parameter of a container
                                   is marked as  true  ,  and  that  container
                                   fails  or  stops  for any reason, all other
                                   containers that are part of  the  task  are
                                   stopped.  If  the  essential parameter of a
                                   container is marked as false,  its  failure
                                   doesn't  affect  the rest of the containers
                                   in a task. If this parameter is omitted,  a
                                   container is assumed to be essential.

                                   All  jobs  must have at least one essential
                                   container.  If  you  have  an   application
                                   that's  composed  of  multiple  containers,
                                   group containers that are used for a common
                                   purpose  into  components, and separate the
                                   different  components  into  multiple  task
                                   definitions.   For  more  information,  see

                                   maxSwap -> (integer)
                                      The total amount of swap memory (in MiB)
                                      a container can use. This  parameter  is
                                      translated  to  the --memory-swap option
                                      to docker run where the value is the sum
                                      of the container memory plus the maxSwap
                                      value.  For  more  information,  see   `

                                      If  a  maxSwap  value of 0 is specified,
                                      the container doesn't use swap. Accepted
                                      values are 0 or any positive integer. If
                                      the maxSwap parameter  is  omitted,  the
                                      container  doesn't use the swap configu-
                                      ration for the container  instance  that
                                      it's running on. A maxSwap value must be
                                      set for the swappiness parameter  to  be
                                      used.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This  parameter  isn't applicable to
                                          jobs that are running on Fargate re-
                                          sources.  Don't provide it for these

                                   swappiness -> (integer)
                                      You can use this  parameter  to  tune  a
                                      container's  memory swappiness behavior.
                                      A swappiness value of 0 causes  swapping
                                      to  not  occur  unless absolutely neces-
                                      sary. A swappiness value of  100  causes
                                      pages  to be swapped aggressively. Valid
                                      values are whole numbers between  0  and
                                      100  . If the swappiness parameter isn't
                                      specified, a  default  value  of  60  is
                                      used.  If  a  value  isn't specified for
                                      maxSwap , then  this  parameter  is  ig-
                                      nored.  If maxSwap is set to 0, the con-
                                      tainer doesn't use swap. This  parameter
                                      maps  to  the --memory-swappiness option
                                      to docker run .

                                      Consider the following when  you  use  a
                                      per-container swap configuration.

                                      o Swap  space  must be enabled and allo-
                                        cated on the  container  instance  for
                                        the containers to use.

                                      NOTE:
                                          By default, the Amazon ECS optimized
                                          AMIs don't have  swap  enabled.  You
                                          must  enable swap on the instance to
                                          use this feature. For more  informa-

                                          locate memory to work as swap  space
                                          in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a
                                          swap file?

                                      o The swap  space  parameters  are  only
                                        supported  for  job  definitions using
                                        EC2 resources.

                                      o If the maxSwap and swappiness  parame-
                                        ters  are  omitted  from a job defini-
                                        tion, each  container  has  a  default
                                        swappiness  value of 60. Moreover, the
                                        total swap usage  is  limited  to  two
                                        times  the  memory  reservation of the
                                        container.

                               logConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   The log configuration specification for the
                                   container.

                                   This parameter maps  to  LogConfig  in  the

                                   docker run .

                                   By default, containers use the same logging
                                   driver that the Docker daemon uses. However
                                   the  container  can use a different logging
                                   driver than the Docker daemon by specifying
                                   a  log  driver  with  this parameter in the
                                   container definition. To  use  a  different
                                   logging  driver  for  a  container, the log
                                   system must be configured properly  on  the
                                   container  instance  (or on a different log
                                   server for  remote  logging  options).  For

                                   .

                                   NOTE:
                                      Amazon ECS currently supports  a  subset
                                      of  the logging drivers available to the

                                      of the Amazon ECS container agent.

                                   This parameter requires version 1.18 of the
                                   Docker Remote API or greater on  your  con-

                                   in  to  your container instance and run the
                                   following  command:  sudo  docker   version

                                          present  to  the container. This pa-
                                          rameter is supported for  jobs  that
                                          are running on Amazon EC2 resources.
                                          If your container attempts to exceed
                                          the  memory specified, the container
                                          is terminated. This  parameter  maps

                                          You must specify at least 4  MiB  of
                                          memory  for  a job. This is required
                                          but  can  be  specified  in  several
                                          places for multi-node parallel (MNP)
                                          jobs. It must be specified for  each
                                          node  at  least once. This parameter
                                          maps to Memory in the Create a  con-

                               ulimits -> (list)
                                   A list of ulimits to set in the  container.
                                   If  a  ulimit  value is specified in a task
                                   definition, it overrides the default values
                                   set by Docker. This parameter maps to Ulim-
                                   its in the Create a  container  section  of
                                   the  Docker Remote API and the --ulimit op-
                                   tion to docker run .

                                   Amazon ECS tasks hosted on Fargate use  the
                                   default  resource  limit  values set by the
                                   operating system with the exception of  the
                                   nofile  resource limit parameter which Far-
                                   gate overrides. The nofile  resource  limit
                                   sets  a  restriction  on the number of open
                                   files that a container can use. The default
                                   nofile  soft  limit is 1024 and the default
                                   hard limit is 65535 .

                                   This parameter requires version 1.18 of the
                                   Docker  Remote  API or greater on your con-
                                   tainer instance. To check the Docker Remote
                                   API version on your container instance, log
                                   in to your container instance and  run  the
                                   following   command:  sudo  docker  version
                                   --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'

                                   NOTE:
                                      This parameter is not supported for Win-

                                   The  user to use inside the container. This
                                   parameter maps to User in the Create a con-
                                   tainer section of the Docker Remote API and
                                   the --user option to docker run.

                                   NOTE:
                                      When running tasks using the  host  net-
                                      work  mode,  don't  run containers using
                                      the root user (UID 0) . We recommend us-
                                      ing a non-root user for better security.

                                   You  can specify the user using the follow-
                                   ing formats. If specifying a  UID  or  GID,
                                   you must specify it as a positive integer.

                            ning on Fargate resources. Jobs that  are  running
                            on  Amazon EC2 resources must not specify this pa-
                            rameter.

                            assignPublicIp -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the job has a public  IP  ad-

                        runtimePlatform -> (structure)
                            An  object that represents the compute environment
                            architecture for Batch jobs on Fargate.

                            operatingSystemFamily -> (string)

                               NOTE:
                                   The  following  parameters  cant be set for
                                   Windows containers: linuxParameters , priv-

                               NOTE:
                                   The Batch Scheduler checks the compute  en-
                                   vironments  that  are  attached  to the job
                                   queue before registering a task  definition
                                   with  Fargate.  In  this  scenario, the job
                                   queue is where the job is submitted. If the
                                   job  requires  a  Windows container and the
                                   first compute environment is  LINUX  ,  the
                                   compute environment is skipped and the next
                                   compute environment is checked until a Win-
                                   dows-based compute environment is found.

                               NOTE:
                                   Fargate Spot is not supported for ARM64 and
                                   Windows-based containers on Fargate. A  job
                                   queue will be blocked if a Fargate ARM64 or
                                   Windows job is submitted  to  a  job  queue
                                   with  only  Fargate  Spot  compute environ-
                                   ments. However, you can attach both FARGATE
                                   and  FARGATE_SPOT  compute  environments to
                                   the same job queue.

                            cpuArchitecture -> (string)
                               The vCPU architecture.  The  default  value  is
                               X86_64 . Valid values are X86_64 and ARM64 .

                               NOTE:
                                   This  parameter  must  be set to X86_64 for
                                   Windows containers.

                               NOTE:
                                   Fargate Spot is not supported for ARM64 and
                                   Windows-based  containers on Fargate. A job

                        volumes -> (list)
                            A list of data volumes used in a job.

                            (structure)
                               A  data volume that's used in a job's container
                               properties.

                               host -> (structure)
                                   The contents of the host  parameter  deter-
                                   mine  whether  your data volume persists on
                                   the host container instance and where  it's
                                   stored.  If  the  host  parameter is empty,
                                   then the Docker daemon assigns a host  path
                                   for  your  data  volume.  However, the data
                                   isn't guaranteed to persist after the  con-
                                   tainers  that  are  associated with it stop
                                   running.

                                   NOTE:
                                      This parameter isn't applicable to  jobs
                                      that  are  running  on Fargate resources
                                      and shouldn't be provided.

                                   sourcePath -> (string)
                                      The path on the host container  instance
                                      that's  presented  to  the container. If
                                      this parameter is empty, then the Docker
                                      daemon has assigned a host path for you.
                                      If this parameter contains a file  loca-
                                      tion,  then  the data volume persists at
                                      the specified location on the host  con-
                                      tainer instance until you delete it man-
                                      ually.  If  the  source  path   location
                                      doesn't  exist on the host container in-
                                      stance, the Docker daemon creates it. If
                                      the location does exist, the contents of
                                      the source path folder are exported.

                                      NOTE:
                                          This parameter isn't  applicable  to
                                          jobs  that run on Fargate resources.
                                          Don't provide this for these jobs.

                               name -> (string)
                                   The name of the volume. It can be up to 255
                                   characters  long.  It can contain uppercase
                                   and  lowercase  letters,  numbers,  hyphens
                                   (-), and underscores (_). This name is ref-
                                   erenced in the  sourceVolume  parameter  of
                                   container definition mountPoints .

                               efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                                   This parameter is specified when you're us-
                                   ing an Amazon Elastic File System file sys-
                                   tem  for job storage. Jobs that are running
                                   on Fargate resources must specify  a  plat-
                                   formVersion of at least 1.4.0 .

                                   fileSystemId -> (string)
                                      The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                                   rootDirectory -> (string)
                                      The directory within the Amazon EFS file
                                      system to mount as  the  root  directory
                                      inside  the  host.  If this parameter is
                                      omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS vol-
                                      ume  is  used  instead. Specifying / has
                                      the same effect as omitting this parame-
                                      ter. The maximum length is 4,096 charac-
                                      ters.
