DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()                                    DESCRIBE-JOB-QUEUES()



NAME
       describe-job-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your job queues.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-job-queues is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: jobQueues

OPTIONS
       --job-queues (list)
          A list of up to 100 queue names or full queue Amazon  Resource  Name
          (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a job queue

       This example describes the HighPriority job queue.

       Command:

          aws batch describe-job-queues --job-queues HighPriority

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueues": [
                  {
                      "status": "VALID",
                      "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/HighPriority",
                      "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
                          {
                              "computeEnvironment": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:compute-environment/C4OnDemand",
                              "order": 1
                          }
                      ],
                      "statusReason": "JobQueue Healthy",
                      "priority": 1,
                      "state": "ENABLED",
                      "jobQueueName": "HighPriority"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       jobQueues -> (list)
          The list of job queues.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details for an Batch job queue.

              jobQueueName -> (string)
                 The job queue name.

              jobQueueArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

              state -> (string)
                 Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs. If the
                 job  queue  state is ENABLED , it can accept jobs. If the job
                 queue state is DISABLED , new jobs  can't  be  added  to  the
                 queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

              schedulingPolicyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy. The
                 format is aws:*Partition* :batch:*Region* :*Account*  :sched-
                 uling-policy/*Name*       ``       .       For       example,
                 ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-pol-
                 icy/MySchedulingPolicy .

              status -> (string)
                 The  status  of the job queue (for example, CREATING or VALID
                 ).

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A short, human-readable string to provide additional  details
                 for the current status of the job queue.

              priority -> (integer)
                 The  priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher pri-
                 ority (or a higher integer value for the priority  parameter)
                 are evaluated first when associated with the same compute en-
                 vironment. Priority is determined in  descending  order.  For
                 example,  a  job  queue  with a priority value of 10 is given
                 scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority  value
                 of  1 . All of the compute environments must be either Amazon
                 EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate  (FARGATE  or  FARGATE_SPOT  ).
                 Amazon EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              computeEnvironmentOrder -> (list)
                 The  compute  environments that are attached to the job queue
                 and the order that job placement is preferred. Compute  envi-
                 ronments are selected for job placement in ascending order.

                 (structure)
                     The  order that compute environments are tried in for job
                     placement within a queue. Compute environments are  tried
                     in  ascending order. For example, if two compute environ-
                     ments are associated with a job queue, the compute  envi-
                     ronment with a lower order integer value is tried for job
                     placement first. Compute  environments  must  be  in  the
                     VALID  state  before  you  can  associate them with a job
                     queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
                     (EC2  or  SPOT  )  or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT );
                     Amazon EC2 and  Fargate  compute  environments  can't  be
                     mixed.

                     NOTE:
                        All  compute  environments  that are associated with a
                        job queue must  share  the  same  architecture.  Batch
                        doesn't  support  mixing compute environment architec-
                        ture types in a single job queue.

                     order -> (integer)
                        The order of the compute environment. Compute environ-
                        ments  are  tried  in ascending order. For example, if
                        two compute environments are  associated  with  a  job
                        queue,  the compute environment with a lower order in-
                        teger value is tried for job placement first.

                     computeEnvironment -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environ-
                        ment.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags that are applied to the job queue. For more informa-
                 tion, see Tagging your Batch resources in Batch User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              jobStateTimeLimitActions -> (list)
                 The set of actions that Batch perform on jobs that remain  at
                 the  head of the job queue in the specified state longer than
                 specified times. Batch will perform each  action  after  max-
                 TimeSeconds has passed.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies  an  action  that Batch will take after the job
                     has remained at the head of the queue  in  the  specified
                     state for longer than the specified time.

                     reason -> (string)
                        The reason to log for the action being taken.

                     state -> (string)
                        The state of the job needed to trigger the action. The
                        only supported value is "RUNNABLE ".

                     maxTimeSeconds -> (integer)
                        The approximate amount of time, in seconds, that  must
                        pass  with  the  job in the specified state before the
                        action is taken. The minimum value is 600 (10 minutes)
                        and the maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).

                     action -> (string)
                        The  action  to  take when a job is at the head of the
                        job queue in the specified state for the specified pe-
                        riod  of  time. The only supported value is "CANCEL ",
                        which will cancel the job.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in  a  future  DescribeJobQueues  re-
          quest. When the results of a DescribeJobQueues request exceed maxRe-
          sults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results.
          This value is null when there are no more results to return.
