          --job-queue <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-queue (string)
          The job queues name or full queue Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       frontOfQueue -> (structure)
          The  list  of  the  first  100  RUNNABLE jobs in each job queue. For
          first-in-first-out (FIFO) job queues,  jobs  are  ordered  based  on
          their  submission  time. For fair share scheduling (FSS) job queues,
          jobs are ordered based on their job priority and share usage.

          jobs -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the first 100 RUNNABLE  jobs
              in  a named job queue. For first-in-first-out (FIFO) job queues,
              jobs are ordered based on their submission time. For fair  share
              scheduling (FSS) job queues, jobs are ordered based on their job
              priority and share usage.

              (structure)
                 An object that represents summary details for the  first  100
                 RUNNABLE jobs in a job queue.

                 jobArn -> (string)
                     The ARN for a job in a named job queue.

                 earliestTimeAtPosition -> (long)
                     The  Unix  timestamp  (in  milliseconds) for when the job
                     transitioned to its current position in the job queue.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (long)
              The Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) for when each of the  first
              100 RUNNABLE jobs were last updated.
