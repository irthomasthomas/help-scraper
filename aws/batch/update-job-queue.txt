OPTIONS
       --job-queue (string)
          The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue.

       --state (string)
          Describes  the  queue's ability to accept new jobs. If the job queue
          state is ENABLED , it can accept jobs. If the  job  queue  state  is
          DISABLED , new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in
          the queue can finish.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --scheduling-policy-arn (string)
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling policy. Once
          a  job queue is created, the fair share scheduling policy can be re-
          placed but not removed. The format  is  aws:*Partition*  :batch:*Re-
          gion*   :*Account*   :scheduling-policy/*Name*  ``  .  For  example,
          ``aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-policy/MySchedul-
          ingPolicy .

       --priority (integer)
          The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or
          a higher integer value for the  priority  parameter)  are  evaluated
          first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
          determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a pri-
          ority  value  of  10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue
          with a priority value of 1 . All of the compute environments must be
          either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ). EC2
          and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       --compute-environment-order (list)
          Details the set of compute environments mapped to a  job  queue  and
          their  order  relative  to each other. This is one of the parameters
          used by the job scheduler to  determine  which  compute  environment
          runs  a  given  job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state
          before you can associate them with a job queue. All of  the  compute
          environments  must  be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE
          or FARGATE_SPOT ). EC2 and Fargate  compute  environments  can't  be
          mixed.

          NOTE:
              All  compute  environments  that are associated with a job queue
              must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't  support  mixing
              compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

          (structure)
              The  order that compute environments are tried in for job place-
              ment within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending
              order.  For  example, if two compute environments are associated
              with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order in-
              teger  value  is tried for job placement first. Compute environ-
              ments must be in the VALID state before you can  associate  them
              with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either
              EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); Amazon
              EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              NOTE:
                 All compute environments that are associated with a job queue
                 must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support  mix-
                 ing  compute  environment  architecture types in a single job
                 queue.

              order -> (integer)
                 The order of the compute  environment.  Compute  environments
                 are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute en-
                 vironments are associated with a job queue, the compute envi-
                 ronment  with  a  lower  order integer value is tried for job
                 placement first.

              computeEnvironment -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          order=integer,computeEnvironment=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "order": integer,
              "computeEnvironment": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --job-state-time-limit-actions (list)
          The set of actions that Batch perform on jobs  that  remain  at  the
          head  of  the job queue in the specified state longer than specified
          times. Batch will  perform  each  action  after  maxTimeSeconds  has
          passed.

          (structure)
              Specifies  an  action that Batch will take after the job has re-
              mained at the head of the  queue  in  the  specified  state  for
              longer than the specified time.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason to log for the action being taken.

              state -> (string)
                 The  state  of the job needed to trigger the action. The only
                 supported value is "RUNNABLE ".

              maxTimeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The approximate amount of time, in seconds,  that  must  pass
                 with  the  job  in  the  specified state before the action is
                 taken. The minimum value is 600 (10 minutes) and the  maximum
                 value is 86,400 (24 hours).

              action -> (string)
                 The action to take when a job is at the head of the job queue
                 in the specified state for the specified period of time.  The
                 only supported value is "CANCEL ", which will cancel the job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          reason=string,state=string,maxTimeSeconds=integer,action=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "reason": "string",
              "state": "RUNNABLE",
              "maxTimeSeconds": integer,
              "action": "CANCEL"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
