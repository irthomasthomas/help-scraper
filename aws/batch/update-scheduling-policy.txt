OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling policy to update.

       --fairshare-policy (structure)
          The fair share policy.

          shareDecaySeconds -> (integer)
              The amount of time (in seconds) to use to calculate a fair share
              percentage for each fair share identifier in  use.  A  value  of
              zero  (0) indicates that only current usage is measured. The de-
              cay allows for more recently run jobs to have more  weight  than
              jobs  that ran earlier. The maximum supported value is 604800 (1
              week).

          computeReservation -> (integer)
              A value used to reserve some of the available maximum  vCPU  for
              fair share identifiers that aren't already used.

              The reserved ratio is
              ``
              (computeReservation /100)^*ActiveFairShares* `` where `` Active-
              FairShares `` is the number of active fair share identifiers.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 88)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                     For example, a computeReservation value of  50  indicates
                     that  Batch reserves 50% of the maximum available vCPU if
                     there's only one fair share identifier. It  reserves  25%
                     if  there  are  two  fair  share identifiers. It reserves
                     12.5% if there are three fair share identifiers.  A  com-
                     puteReservation  value  of 25 indicates that Batch should
                     reserve 25% of the maximum available vCPU if there's only
                     one  fair  share  identifier, 6.25% if there are two fair
                     share identifiers, and 1.56%  if  there  are  three  fair
                     share identifiers.

                     The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 99.

          shareDistribution -> (list)
              An  array  of  SharedIdentifier objects that contain the weights
              for the fair share identifiers for the fair share  policy.  Fair
              share  identifiers that aren't included have a default weight of
              1.0 .

              (structure)
                 Specifies the weights for the fair share identifiers for  the
                 fair  share  policy.  Fair  share identifiers that aren't in-
                 cluded have a default weight of 1.0 .

                 shareIdentifier -> (string)
                     A fair share identifier or fair share identifier  prefix.
                     If the string ends with an asterisk (*), this entry spec-
                     ifies the weight factor to use for fair share identifiers
                     that start with that prefix. The list of fair share iden-
                     tifiers in a fair share policy can't overlap.  For  exam-
                     ple,  you can't have one that specifies a shareIdentifier
                     of UserA* and another that specifies a shareIdentifier of
                     UserA-1 .

                     There  can be no more than 500 fair share identifiers ac-
                     tive in a job queue.

                     The string is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters, and
                     can be followed by an asterisk (*).

                 weightFactor -> (float)
                     The  weight factor for the fair share identifier. The de-
                     fault value is 1.0. A lower value has a  higher  priority
                     for compute resources. For example, jobs that use a share
                     identifier with a weight factor  of  0.125  (1/8)  get  8
                     times  the  compute  resources  of  jobs that use a share
                     identifier with a weight factor of 1.

                     The smallest supported value is 0.0001, and  the  largest
                     supported value is 999.9999.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          shareDecaySeconds=integer,computeReservation=integer,shareDistribution=[{shareIdentifier=string,weightFactor=float},{shareIdentifier=string,weightFactor=float}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "shareDecaySeconds": integer,
            "computeReservation": integer,
            "shareDistribution": [
              {
                "shareIdentifier": "string",
                "weightFactor": float
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
