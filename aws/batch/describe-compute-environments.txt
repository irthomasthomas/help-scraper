NAME
       describe-compute-environments -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes one or more of your compute environments.

       If  you're  using an unmanaged compute environment, you can use the De-
       scribeComputeEnvironment operation to determine the ecsClusterArn  that
       you launch your Amazon ECS container instances into.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-compute-environments  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: computeEnvironments

OPTIONS
       --compute-environments (list)
          A list of up to 100 compute environment names  or  full  Amazon  Re-
          source Name (ARN) entries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       computeEnvironments -> (list)
          The list of compute environments.

          (structure)
              An object that represents an Batch compute environment.

              computeEnvironmentName -> (string)
                 The name of the compute environment. It  can  be  up  to  128
                 characters  long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase let-
                 ters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

              computeEnvironmentArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

              unmanagedvCpus -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of VCPUs expected to be used for an unman-
                 aged compute environment.

              ecsClusterArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the underlying Amazon ECS
                 cluster that the compute environment uses.

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags applied to the compute environment.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the compute environment: MANAGED or  UNMANAGED  .
                 For  more  information, see Compute environments in the Batch
                 User Guide .

              state -> (string)
                 The state of the compute environment. The  valid  values  are
                 ENABLED or DISABLED .

                 If  the  state  is ENABLED , then the Batch scheduler can at-
                 tempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the  com-
                 pute  resources  within the environment. If the compute envi-
                 ronment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in
                 automatically based on the job queue demand.

                 If  the  state is DISABLED , then the Batch scheduler doesn't
                 attempt to place jobs  within  the  environment.  Jobs  in  a
                 STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Man-
                 aged compute environments in the DISABLED state  don't  scale
                 out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances
                 become idle.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the compute environment  (for  example,
                 CREATING or VALID ).

              statusReason -> (string)
                 A  short, human-readable string to provide additional details
                 for the current status of the compute environment.

              computeResources -> (structure)
                 The compute resources defined for  the  compute  environment.
                 For  more  information, see Compute environments in the Batch
                 User Guide .

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of compute environment: EC2 , SPOT ,  FARGATE  ,
                     or FARGATE_SPOT . For more information, see Compute envi-
                     ronments in the Batch User Guide .

                     If you choose SPOT , you must also specify an Amazon  EC2
                     Spot  Fleet role with the spotIamFleetRole parameter. For
                     more information, see Amazon EC2 spot fleet role  in  the
                     Batch User Guide .

                 allocationStrategy -> (string)
                     The  allocation  strategy to use for the compute resource
                     if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type
                     can  be  allocated. This might be because of availability
                     of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2  service
                     limits  . For more information, see Allocation strategies
                     in the Batch User Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                        BEST_FIT (default)

                     Batch  selects  an instance type that best fits the needs
                     of the jobs with a preference  for  the  lowest-cost  in-
                     stance  type. If additional instances of the selected in-
                     stance type aren't available, Batch waits for  the  addi-
                     tional  instances to be available. If there aren't enough
                     instances available or the user is  reaching  Amazon  EC2
                     service  limits  ,  additional  jobs aren't run until the
                     currently running jobs  are  completed.  This  allocation
                     strategy  keeps  costs  lower  but  can limit scaling. If
                     you're using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT , the  Spot  Fleet
                     IAM  Role must be specified. Compute resources that use a
                     BEST_FIT allocation strategy don't support infrastructure
                     updates and can't update some parameters. For more infor-
                     mation, see Updating compute environments  in  the  Batch
                     User Guide .
                        BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE

                     Batch  selects  additional  instance types that are large
                     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue.
                     Its  preference is for instance types with lower cost vC-
                     PUs. If additional instances of the  previously  selected
                     instance  types  aren't  available, Batch selects new in-
                     stance types.
                        SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED

                     Batch selects one or more instance types that  are  large
                     enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue.
                     Its preference is for instance types that are less likely
                     to  be  interrupted.  This  allocation  strategy  is only
                     available for Spot Instance compute resources.

                     With both  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  and  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTI-
                     MIZED  strategies  using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and
                     the BEST_FIT strategy using Spot Instances,  Batch  might
                     need  to  exceed  maxvCpus to meet your capacity require-
                     ments. In this event, Batch  never  exceeds  maxvCpus  by
                     more than a single instance.

                 minvCpus -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environ-
                     ment should maintain (even if the compute environment  is
                     DISABLED ).

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                 maxvCpus -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute en-
                     vironment can reach.

                     NOTE:
                        With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTI-
                        MIZED allocation strategies using  On-Demand  or  Spot
                        Instances,  and  the  BEST_FIT strategy using Spot In-
                        stances, Batch might need to exceed maxvCpus  to  meet
                        your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never
                        exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single  instance.  For
                        example,  no  more  than  a single instance from among
                        those specified in your compute environment  is  allo-
                        cated.

                 desiredvCpus -> (integer)
                     The desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute en-
                     vironment. Batch modifies this value between the  minimum
                     and maximum values based on job queue demand.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                 instanceTypes -> (list)
                     The instances types that can be launched. You can specify
                     instance  families  to  launch  any  instance type within
                     those families (for example, c5 or p3 ), or you can spec-
                     ify specific sizes within a family (such as c5.8xlarge ).
                     You can also choose  optimal  to  select  instance  types
                     (from  the  C4,  M4, and R4 instance families) that match
                     the demand of your job queues.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                     NOTE:
                        When  you  create  a compute environment, the instance
                        types that you select for the compute environment must
                        share  the  same  architecture. For example, you can't
                        mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environ-
                        ment.

                     NOTE:
                        Currently,  optimal  uses  instance types from the C4,
                        M4, and R4 instance families. In  Regions  that  don't
                        have  instance types from those instance families, in-
                        stance types from the C5, M5, and R5 instance families
                        are used.

                     (string)

                 imageId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Machine  Image  (AMI)  ID used for instances
                     launched in the compute environment.  This  parameter  is
                     overridden  by  the imageIdOverride member of the Ec2Con-
                     figuration structure.

                     NOTE:
                        This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                     NOTE:
                        The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must
                        match the architecture of the instance types that  you
                        intend  to use for that compute environment. For exam-
                        ple, if your  compute  environment  uses  A1  instance
                        types,  the  compute resource AMI that you choose must
                        support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both  x86  and
                        ARM  versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux
                        2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon  ECS-optimized
                        Amazon  Linux  2  AMI  in the Amazon Elastic Container
                        Service Developer Guide .

                 subnets -> (list)
                     The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched.
                     These  subnets  must be within the same VPC. Fargate com-
                     pute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more in-
                     formation,  see  VPCs  and subnets in the Amazon VPC User
                     Guide .

                     (string)

                 securityGroupIds -> (list)
                     The Amazon EC2 security groups that are  associated  with
                     instances  launched  in  the  compute environment. One or
                     more security groups must be specified, either in securi-
                     tyGroupIds  or  using  a  launch  template  referenced in
                     launchTemplate . This parameter is required for jobs that
                     are  running  on  Fargate  resources  and must contain at
                     least one security group. Fargate doesn't support  launch
                     templates.  If  security  groups are specified using both
                     securityGroupIds and launchTemplate , the values in secu-
                     rityGroupIds are used.

                     (string)

                 ec2KeyPair -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  EC2  key  pair  that's  used  for  instances
                     launched in the compute environment. You can use this key
                     pair to log in to your instances with SSH.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                 instanceRole -> (string)
                     The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 in-
                     stances  in  a  compute  environment. You can specify the
                     short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an  in-
                     stance profile. For example, `` ecsInstanceRole `` or
                     ``
                     arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id>    :instance-profile/ecsIn-
                     stanceRole `` . For more information, see Amazon ECS  in-

                 tags -> (map)
                     Key-value pair tags to be applied to EC2  resources  that
                     are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these
                     take the form of "String1": "String2" , where String1  is
                     the  tag  key and String2 is the tag value-for example, {
                     "Name": "Batch Instance - C4OnDemand" } . This is helpful
                     for  recognizing  your  Batch instances in the Amazon EC2
                     console. Updating these tags requires  an  infrastructure
                     update  to the compute environment. For more information,
                     see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide
                     .  These  tags aren't seen when using the Batch ListTags-
                     ForResource API operation.

                     NOTE:

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 placementGroup -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  EC2  placement  group to associate with your
                     compute resources. If you  intend  to  submit  multi-node
                     parallel  jobs  to  your  compute environment, you should
                     consider creating a cluster placement group and associate
                     it   with   your   compute  resources.  This  keeps  your
                     multi-node parallel job on  a  logical  grouping  of  in-
                     stances  within a single Availability Zone with high net-
                     work flow potential. For more information, see  Placement
                     groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources. Don't specify it.

                 bidPercentage -> (integer)
                     The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can  be
                     when  compared with the On-Demand price for that instance
                     type before instances are launched. For example, if  your
                     maximum  percentage  is  20%, then the Spot price must be
                     less than 20% of the current  On-Demand  price  for  that
                     Amazon  EC2  instance. You always pay the lowest (market)
                     price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you
                     leave  this field empty, the default value is 100% of the
                     On-Demand price.

                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot
                     Fleet IAM role applied to  a  SPOT  compute  environment.
                     This  role  is required if the allocation strategy set to
                     BEST_FIT or if the allocation strategy  isn't  specified.

                     WARNING:
                        To tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet
                        IAM role  specified  here  must  use  the  newer  Ama-

                 launchTemplate -> (structure)
                     The  launch  template  to use for your compute resources.
                     Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in
                     a   CreateComputeEnvironment  API  operation override the
                     same parameters in the launch template. You must  specify
                     either  the launch template ID or launch template name in
                     the request, but not  both.  For  more  information,  see
                     Launch template support in the Batch User Guide .

                     launchTemplateId -> (string)
                        The ID of the launch template.

                     launchTemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the launch template.

                     version -> (string)
                        The version number of the launch template,  $Latest  ,
                        or $Default .

                        If  the  value  is $Latest , the latest version of the
                        launch template is used. If the value  is  $Default  ,
                        the default version of the launch template is used.

                        WARNING:
                            If the AMI ID that's used in a compute environment
                            is from the launch template, the AMI isn't changed
                            when the compute environment is updated. It's only
                            changed if the updateToLatestImageVersion  parame-
                            ter  for  the compute environment is set to true .
                            During an infrastructure update, if either $Latest
                            or  $Default  is specified, Batch re-evaluates the
                            launch template version, and it might use  a  dif-
                            ferent version of the launch template. This is the
                            case even if the launch template  isn't  specified
                            in  the  update.  When updating a compute environ-
                            ment, changing the launch template requires an in-
                            frastructure  update  of  the compute environment.

                               The AMI that you choose for a compute  environ-
                               ment  must  match  the  architecture of the in-
                               stance types that you intend to  use  for  that
                               compute  environment. For example, if your com-
                               pute environment uses A1  instance  types,  the
                               compute  resource AMI that you choose must sup-
                               port ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends  both  x86
                               and  ARM  versions  of the Amazon ECS-optimized
                               Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more  information,  see
                               Amazon  ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the
                               Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service   Developer
                               Guide .

                        imageKubernetesVersion -> (string)
                            The  Kubernetes  version  for the compute environ-
                            ment. If you don't specify  a  value,  the  latest
                            version that Batch supports is used.

              serviceRole -> (string)
                 The  service role that's associated with the compute environ-
                 ment that allows Batch to make calls to Amazon  Web  Services
                 API  operations  on  your  behalf.  For more information, see
                 Batch service IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

              updatePolicy -> (structure)
                 Specifies the infrastructure update policy  for  the  compute
                 environment.  For  more  information about infrastructure up-
                 dates, see Updating compute environments in  the  Batch  User
                 Guide .

                 terminateJobsOnUpdate -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether jobs are automatically terminated when
                     the computer environment infrastructure is  updated.  The
                     default value is false .

                 jobExecutionTimeoutMinutes -> (long)
                     Specifies  the  job timeout (in minutes) when the compute
                     environment infrastructure is updated. The default  value
                     is 30.

              eksConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  configuration  for  the Amazon EKS cluster that supports
                 the Batch compute environment. Only specify this parameter if
                 the containerOrchestrationType is EKS .

                 eksClusterArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EKS cluster.
                     An example is
                     ``
                     arn:aws :eks:us-east-1 :123456789012 :cluster/ClusterFor-
                     Batch `` .

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 1006)
                            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 kubernetesNamespace -> (string)
                     The  namespace  of  the Amazon EKS cluster. Batch manages
                     pods in this namespace. The value  can't  left  empty  or
                     null.  It must be fewer than 64 characters long, can't be
                     set to default , can't start  with  "kube-  ,"  and  must
                     match          this          regular          expression:
                     ^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$ . For  more  information,
                     see Namespaces in the Kubernetes documentation.

              containerOrchestrationType -> (string)
                 The  orchestration type of the compute environment. The valid
                 values are ECS (default) or EKS .

              uuid -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the compute environment.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken value to include in a  future  DescribeComputeEnviron-
          ments request. When the results of a DescribeComputeEnvironments re-
          quest exceed maxResults , this value can be  used  to  retrieve  the
          next  page of results. This value is null when there are no more re-
          sults to return.
