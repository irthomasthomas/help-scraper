OPTIONS
       --job-definition-name (string)
          The name of the job definition to register. It can be up to 128 let-
          ters long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters,  numbers,
          hyphens (-), and underscores (_).

       --type (string)
          The  type  of  job definition. For more information about multi-node
          parallel jobs, see Creating a multi-node parallel job definition  in
          the Batch User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If  the  job  is  run on Fargate resources, then multinode isn't
              supported.

          Possible values:

          o container

          o multinode

       --parameters (map)
          Default parameter substitution placeholders to set in the job  defi-
          nition. Parameters are specified as a key-value pair mapping. Param-
          eters in a SubmitJob request override  any  corresponding  parameter
          defaults from the job definition.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --scheduling-priority (integer)
          The  scheduling  priority  for jobs that are submitted with this job
          definition. This will only affect jobs in job  queues  with  a  fair
          share  policy. Jobs with a higher scheduling priority will be sched-
          uled before jobs with a lower scheduling priority.

          The minimum supported value is 0 and the maximum supported value  is
          9999.

       --container-properties (structure)
          An  object  with  various  properties  specific  to single-node con-
          tainer-based jobs. If the job definition's type  parameter  is  con-
          tainer  ,  then you must specify either containerProperties or node-
          Properties .

          NOTE:
              If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not  specify
              nodeProperties ; use only containerProperties .

          image -> (string)
              The  image  used to start a container. This string is passed di-
              rectly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker  Hub  registry
              are  available by default. Other repositories are specified with
              `` repository-url /image :tag `` . Up to 255 letters  (uppercase
              and  lowercase), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods,
              forward slashes, and number signs are  allowed.  This  parameter
              maps  to  Image  in the Create a container section of the Docker
              Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run .

              NOTE:
                 Docker image architecture must match the processor  architec-
                 ture  of the compute resources that they're scheduled on. For
                 example, ARM-based Docker images can only  run  on  ARM-based
                 compute resources.

              o Images  in  Amazon  ECR  Public repositories use the full reg-
                istry/repository[:tag] or registry/repository[@digest]  naming
                conventions. For example,
                ``
                public.ecr.aws/registry_alias /my-web-app :latest `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 183)
                Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              o Images  in  Amazon  ECR repositories use the full registry and
                repository   URI   (for   example,   012345678910.dkr.ecr.<re-
                gion-name>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name> ).

              o Images  in  official  repositories  on Docker Hub use a single
                name (for example, ubuntu or mongo ).

              o Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified  with
                an organization name (for example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

              o Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a
                domain name (for example, quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu ).

          vcpus -> (integer)
              This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to  spec-
              ify  the vCPU requirements for the job definition. It's not sup-
              ported for jobs running on Fargate resources. For  jobs  running
              on  EC2 resources, it specifies the number of vCPUs reserved for
              the job.

              Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This parameter maps
              to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Re-
              mote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run . The  number
              of  vCPUs  must  be  specified  but  can be specified in several
              places. You must specify it at least once for each node.

          memory -> (integer)
              This parameter is deprecated, use resourceRequirements to  spec-
              ify  the  memory  requirements  for the job definition. It's not
              supported for jobs running on Fargate resources. For  jobs  run-
              ning  on  EC2  resources, it specifies the memory hard limit (in
              MiB) for a container. If your container attempts to  exceed  the
              specified  number,  it's terminated. You must specify at least 4
              MiB of memory for a job using this parameter.  The  memory  hard
              limit  can  be specified in several places. It must be specified
              for each node at least once.

          command -> (list)
              The command that's passed to the container. This parameter  maps
              to  Cmd  in  the Create a container section of the Docker Remote
              API and the COMMAND parameter to docker run . For more  informa-
              tion,  see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd
              .

              (string)

          jobRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM  role  that  the  con-
              tainer  can assume for Amazon Web Services permissions. For more
              information, see IAM roles for tasks in the Amazon Elastic  Con-
              tainer Service Developer Guide .

          executionRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that Batch
              can assume. For jobs that run on  Fargate  resources,  you  must
              provide  an execution role. For more information, see Batch exe-
              cution IAM role in the Batch User Guide .

          volumes -> (list)
              A list of data volumes used in a job.

              (structure)
                 A data volume used in a job's container properties.

                 host -> (structure)
                     The contents of the host parameter determine whether your
                     data  volume  persists on the host container instance and
                     where it is stored. If the host parameter is empty,  then
                     the  Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data vol-
                     ume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to persist  after
                     the containers associated with it stop running.

                     NOTE:
                        This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are run-
                        ning on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                     sourcePath -> (string)
                        The path on the host container  instance  that's  pre-
                        sented  to  the container. If this parameter is empty,
                        then the Docker daemon has assigned a  host  path  for
                        you.  If this parameter contains a file location, then
                        the data volume persists at the specified location  on
                        the  host container instance until you delete it manu-
                        ally. If the source path location doesn't exist on the
                        host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it.
                        If the location does exist, the contents of the source
                        path folder are exported.

                        NOTE:
                            This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that run
                            on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the volume. It can be up to 255 letters long.
                     It  can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers,
                     hyphens (-), and underscores (_). This name is referenced
                     in  the  sourceVolume  parameter  of container definition
                     mountPoints .

                 efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                     This parameter is specified when you are using an  Amazon
                     Elastic  File  System  file  system for job storage. Jobs
                     that are running on  Fargate  resources  must  specify  a
                     platformVersion of at least 1.4.0 .

                     fileSystemId -> (string)
                        The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                     rootDirectory -> (string)
                        The  directory  within  the  Amazon EFS file system to
                        mount as the root directory inside the host.  If  this
                        parameter  is omitted, the root of the Amazon EFS vol-
                        ume is used instead. Specifying / has the same  effect
                        as  omitting  this  parameter.  The  maximum length is
                        4,096 characters.

                        WARNING:
                            If an EFS access point is specified in the  autho-
                            rizationConfig , the root directory parameter must
                            either be omitted or set to / , which enforces the
                            path set on the Amazon EFS access point.

                     transitEncryption -> (string)
                        Determines whether to enable encryption for Amazon EFS
                        data in transit between the Amazon ECS  host  and  the
                        Amazon  EFS server. Transit encryption must be enabled
                        if Amazon EFS IAM authorization is used. If  this  pa-
                        rameter  is  omitted, the default value of DISABLED is
                        used. For more information,  see  Encrypting  data  in
                        transit in the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide .

                     transitEncryptionPort -> (integer)
                        The  port  to  use when sending encrypted data between
                        the Amazon ECS host and the Amazon EFS server. If  you
                        don't  specify  a transit encryption port, it uses the
                        port selection strategy  that  the  Amazon  EFS  mount
                        helper  uses.  The value must be between 0 and 65,535.
                        For more information, see EFS mount helper in the Ama-
                        zon Elastic File System User Guide .

                     authorizationConfig -> (structure)
                        The authorization configuration details for the Amazon
                        EFS file system.

                        accessPointId -> (string)
                            The Amazon EFS access point ID to use. If  an  ac-
                            cess  point is specified, the root directory value
                            specified in the EFSVolumeConfiguration  must  ei-
                            ther be omitted or set to / which will enforce the
                            path set on the EFS access  point.  If  an  access
                            point  is used, transit encryption must be enabled
                            in the EFSVolumeConfiguration . For more  informa-
                            tion, see Working with Amazon EFS access points in
                            the Amazon Elastic File System User Guide .

                        iam -> (string)
                            Whether or not to use the Batch job IAM  role  de-
                            fined in a job definition when mounting the Amazon
                            EFS file system. If  enabled,  transit  encryption
                            must be enabled in the EFSVolumeConfiguration . If
                            this parameter is omitted, the  default  value  of
                            DISABLED  is used. For more information, see Using
                            Amazon EFS access points in the Batch User Guide .
                            EFS IAM authorization requires that TransitEncryp-
                            tion be ENABLED and that a  JobRoleArn  is  speci-
                            fied.

          environment -> (list)
              The environment variables to pass to a container. This parameter
              maps to Env in the Create a container section of the Docker  Re-
              mote API and the --env option to docker run .

              WARNING:
                 We  don't recommend using plaintext environment variables for
                 sensitive information, such as credential data.

              NOTE:
                 Environment variables must not start with  AWS_BATCH  ;  this
                 naming  convention  is reserved for variables that are set by
                 the Batch service.

              (structure)
                 A key-value pair object.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the key-value  pair.  For  environment  vari-
                     ables, this is the name of the environment variable.

                 value -> (string)
                     The  value  of  the key-value pair. For environment vari-
                     ables, this is the value of the environment variable.

          mountPoints -> (list)
              The mount points for data volumes in your container. This param-
              eter  maps  to  Volumes in the Create a container section of the
              Docker Remote API and the --volume option to docker run .

              (structure)
                 Details on a Docker volume mount point that's used in a job's
                 container  properties.  This parameter maps to Volumes in the
                 Create a container section of the Docker Remote API  and  the
                 --volume option to docker run.

                 containerPath -> (string)
                     The  path  on  the  container  where  the  host volume is
                     mounted.

                 readOnly -> (boolean)
                     If this value is true , the container has  read-only  ac-
                     cess to the volume. Otherwise, the container can write to
                     the volume. The default value is false .

                 sourceVolume -> (string)
                     The name of the volume to mount.

          readonlyRootFilesystem -> (boolean)
              When this parameter is true, the container  is  given  read-only
              access to its root file system. This parameter maps to Readonly-
              Rootfs in the Create a container section of  the  Docker  Remote
              API and the --read-only option to docker run .

          privileged -> (boolean)
              When  this  parameter  is  true, the container is given elevated
              permissions on the host container instance (similar to the  root
              user).  This  parameter  maps to Privileged in the Create a con-
              tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the --privileged op-
              tion to docker run . The default value is false.

              NOTE:
                 This  parameter  isn't applicable to jobs that are running on
                 Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided, or specified  as
                 false.

          ulimits -> (list)
              A  list  of ulimits to set in the container. This parameter maps
              to Ulimits in the Create a container section of the  Docker  Re-

          user -> (string)
              The  user  name to use inside the container. This parameter maps
              to User in the Create a container section of the  Docker  Remote
              API and the --user option to docker run .

          instanceType -> (string)
              The instance type to use for a multi-node parallel job. All node
              groups in a multi-node parallel job must use the  same  instance
              type.

              NOTE:
                 This parameter isn't applicable to single-node container jobs
                 or jobs that run on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be  pro-
                 vided.

          resourceRequirements -> (list)
              The  type  and amount of resources to assign to a container. The

                 The type and amount of a resource to assign to  a  container.
                 The supported resources include GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .

                 value -> (string)
                     The quantity of the specified resource to reserve for the
                     container. The values vary based on the type specified.
                        type="GPU"

                     The number of physical GPUs to reserve for the container.
                     The  number  of GPUs reserved for all containers in a job

                     pute resource that the job is launched on.

                     NOTE:
                        GPUs  are  not  available for jobs that are running on
                        Fargate resources.

                        type="MEMORY"

                     The memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the  container.
                     This  parameter is supported for jobs that are running on
                     EC2 resources. If your container attempts to  exceed  the
                     memory  specified,  the container is terminated. This pa-
                     rameter maps to Memory in the Create a container  section
                     of  the  Docker  Remote  API  and  the --memory option to
                     docker run . You must specify at least 4  MiB  of  memory
                     for  a job. This is required but can be specified in sev-
                     eral places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs.  It  must
                     be  specified for each node at least once. This parameter
                     maps to Memory in the Create a container section  of  the
                     Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run .

                     NOTE:
                        If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization
                        by providing your jobs as much memory as possible  for
                        a  particular  instance type, see Memory management in
                        the Batch User Guide .

                     For jobs that are  running  on  Fargate  resources,  then
                     value  is  the hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of
                     the supported values and the VCPU values must be  one  of
                     the values supported for that memory value.

                     tion of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option
                     to  docker  run  .  Each  vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU
                     shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at least  one
                     vCPU.  This  is  required but can be specified in several
                     places; it must be specified for each node at least once.

                     For jobs that are  running  on  Fargate  resources,  then
                     value must match one of the supported values and the MEM-
                     ORY values must be one of the values supported  for  that
                     VCPU value. The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and

              devices -> (list)
                 Any host devices to expose to the container.  This  parameter
                 maps  to  Devices  in  the  Create a container section of the
                 Docker Remote API and the --device option to docker run .

                 NOTE:

                        the host device. By default,  the  hostPath  value  is
                        used.

                     permissions -> (list)
                        The  explicit  permissions to provide to the container
                        for the device. By default, the container has  permis-

              initProcessEnabled -> (boolean)
                 If  true,  run an init process inside the container that for-
                 wards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the
                 --init option to docker run . This parameter requires version
                 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater  on  your  container
                 instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your con-

              sharedMemorySize -> (integer)
                 The value for the size (in MiB) of the /dev/shm volume.  This
                 parameter maps to the --shm-size option to docker run .

                        (string)

              maxSwap -> (integer)
                 The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use.
                 This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap  option  to
                 docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory
                 plus the maxSwap value. For more information,  see  `  --mem-
                 ory-swap                      details                      <-
                 https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_con-
                 straints/#--memory-swap-details>`__  in the Docker documenta-
                 tion.

                 If a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the  container  doesn't
                 use  swap.  Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If
                 the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container  doesn't  use
                 the  swap configuration for the container instance it is run-
                 ning on. A maxSwap value must be set for the  swappiness  pa-
                 rameter to be used.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running
                     on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

              swappiness -> (integer)
                 This allows you to tune a container's memory  swappiness  be-
                 havior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen
                 unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes
                 pages  to  be  swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are
                 whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter
                 isn't  specified,  a  default value of 60 is used. If a value
                 isn't specified for maxSwap , then this parameter is ignored.
                 If  maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This
                 parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness  option  to  docker
                 run .

                 Consider the following when you use a per-container swap con-
                 figuration.

                 o Swap space must be enabled and allocated on  the  container
                   instance for the containers to use.

                 NOTE:
                     The  Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled by
                     default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this
                     feature.  For  more  information, see Instance store swap
                     volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux  Instances
                     or  How  do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an
                     Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?

                 o The swap space parameters are only supported for job  defi-
                   nitions using EC2 resources.

                 o If the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted from a
                   job definition, each container will have a default  swappi-
                   ness  value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited
                   to two times the memory reservation of the container.

                 NOTE:
                     This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are  running
                     on Fargate resources and shouldn't be provided.

          logConfiguration -> (structure)
              The log configuration specification for the container.

              This  parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container sec-
              tion of the Docker Remote API and  the  --log-driver  option  to
              docker  run . By default, containers use the same logging driver
              that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might  use  a
              different  logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a
              log driver with this parameter in the container  definition.  To
              use  a  different logging driver for a container, the log system
              must be configured properly on the container instance (or  on  a
              different  log  server for remote logging options). For more in-
              formation on the options for different  supported  log  drivers,
              see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.

              NOTE:
                 Batch  currently  supports  a  subset  of the logging drivers
                 available to the Docker daemon (shown in  the   LogConfigura-
                 tion data type).

              This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or
              greater on your container instance. To check the  Docker  Remote
              API  version on your container instance, log into your container
              instance and run the following command: sudo  docker  version  |
              grep "Server API version"

              NOTE:
                 The  Amazon  ECS  container  agent running on a container in-
                 stance must register the logging drivers  available  on  that
                 instance  with  the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment
                 variable before containers placed on that  instance  can  use
                 these  log  configuration  options. For more information, see
                 Amazon ECS container agent configuration in the Amazon  Elas-
                 tic Container Service Developer Guide .

              logDriver -> (string)
                 The  log  driver  to  use for the container. The valid values
                 listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS
                 container agent can communicate with by default.

                 The  supported  log  drivers  are  awslogs , fluentd , gelf ,
                 json-file , journald , logentries , syslog , and splunk .

                 NOTE:
                     Jobs that are running on Fargate resources are restricted
                     to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.

                     awslogs

                 Specifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more
                 information, see Using the awslogs log driver  in  the  Batch
                 User  Guide  and Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver in the
                 Docker documentation.
                     fluentd

                 Specifies the Fluentd logging driver. For  more  information,

                 For  more  information,  including  usage  and  options,  see
                 Graylog Extended Format logging driver in the Docker documen-
                 tation.
                     journald

                 Specifies  the journald logging driver. For more information,
                 including usage and options, see Journald logging  driver  in
                 the Docker documentation.
                     json-file

                 Specifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information,
                 including usage and options, see JSON File logging driver  in
                 the Docker documentation.
                     splunk

                 Specifies  the  Splunk  logging driver. For more information,
                 including usage and options, see Splunk logging driver in the

                 including usage and options, see Syslog logging driver in the
                 Docker documentation.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  have  a  custom driver that's not listed earlier
                     that you want to  work  with  the  Amazon  ECS  container
                     agent,  you  can  fork  the  Amazon  ECS  container agent
                     project that's available on GitHub and  customize  it  to
                     work  with  that  driver. We encourage you to submit pull
                     requests for changes that you want to have included. How-
                     ever,  Amazon Web Services doesn't currently support run-
                     ning modified copies of this software.

                 This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API
                 or  greater  on  your container instance. To check the Docker
                 Remote API version on your container instance, log into  your
                 container instance and run the following command: sudo docker
                 version | grep "Server API version"

              options -> (map)
                 The configuration options to send to the log driver. This pa-
                 rameter  requires  version  1.19  of the Docker Remote API or
                 greater on your container instance. To check the  Docker  Re-
                 mote  API  version  on your container instance, log into your
                 container instance and run the following command: sudo docker
                 version | grep "Server API version"

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              secretOptions -> (list)
                 The secrets to pass to the log configuration. For more infor-
                 mation, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide
                 .

                     An  object representing the secret to expose to your con-
                     tainer. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the fol-
                     lowing ways:

                     o To  inject sensitive data into your containers as envi-
                       ronment variables, use the secrets container definition
                       parameter.

                     o To  reference sensitive information in the log configu-
                       ration of a container, use the secretOptions  container
                       definition parameter.

                     For  more  information,  see Specifying sensitive data in
                     the Batch User Guide .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the secret.

                     valueFrom -> (string)

                        secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the  Amazon
                        Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                        NOTE:
                            If the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parame-
                            ter Store parameter exists in the same  Region  as
                            the  job you're launching, then you can use either
                            the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the  pa-
                            rameter  exists  in  a  different Region, then the
                            full ARN must be specified.

          secrets -> (list)
              The  secrets  for  the  container.  For  more  information,  see

                 An  object  representing  the  secret  to expose to your con-
                 tainer. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the  follow-
                 ing ways:

                 o To  inject  sensitive data into your containers as environ-
                   ment variables, use the secrets container definition param-
                   eter.

                 o To reference sensitive information in the log configuration
                   of a container, use the secretOptions container  definition
                   parameter.

                 For  more  information,  see Specifying sensitive data in the
                 Batch User Guide .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the secret.

                 valueFrom -> (string)
                     The secret to expose to the container. The supported val-
                     ues are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret
                     or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                     NOTE:
                        If  the  Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter
                        Store parameter exists in the same Region as  the  job
                        you're launching, then you can use either the full ARN
                        or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a
                        different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.

          networkConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  network  configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate
              resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not spec-
              ify this parameter.

              assignPublicIp -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the  job should have a public IP address.
                 For a job that is running on Fargate resources in  a  private
                 subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example,
                 to pull container images), the private subnet requires a  NAT
                 gateway  be  attached  to route requests to the internet. For
                 more information, see Amazon ECS task networking  .  The  de-
                 fault value is "DISABLED".

          fargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  platform configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate
              resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not spec-
              ify this parameter.

              platformVersion -> (string)
                 The  Fargate  platform  version where the jobs are running. A
                 platform version is specified only for jobs that are  running
                 on  Fargate  resources.  If  one  isn't specified, the LATEST
                 platform version is used by default. This uses a recent,  ap-
                 proved version of the Fargate platform for compute resources.
                 For more information, see Fargate platform  versions  in  the

       --node-properties (structure)
          An  object  with  various properties specific to multi-node parallel
          jobs. If you specify  node  properties  for  a  job,  it  becomes  a
          multi-node parallel job. For more information, see Multi-node Paral-
          lel Jobs in the Batch User Guide . If the job definition's type  pa-
          rameter is container , then you must specify either containerProper-
          ties or nodeProperties .

          NOTE:
              If the job runs on Fargate resources, then you must not  specify
              nodeProperties ; use containerProperties instead.

          numNodes -> (integer)
              The number of nodes associated with a multi-node parallel job.

          mainNode -> (integer)
              Specifies  the node index for the main node of a multi-node par-
              allel job. This node index value must be fewer than  the  number
              of nodes.

          nodeRangeProperties -> (list)
              A  list  of  node  ranges and their properties associated with a
              multi-node parallel job.

              (structure)
                 An object representing the properties of the node range for a
                 multi-node parallel job.

                 targetNodes -> (string)
                     The  range  of nodes, using node index values. A range of
                     0:3 indicates nodes with index values of 0 through 3 . If
                     the starting range value is omitted (:n ), then 0 is used
                     to start the range. If the ending range value is  omitted
                     (n:  ),  then  the highest possible node index is used to
                     end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account
                     for all nodes (0:n ). You can nest node ranges, for exam-
                     ple 0:10 and 4:5 , in which case the 4:5 range properties
                     override the 0:10 properties.

                 container -> (structure)
                     The container details for the node range.

                     image -> (string)
                        The  image  used  to start a container. This string is
                        passed directly to the Docker daemon.  Images  in  the
                        Docker  Hub  registry  are available by default. Other
                        repositories are specified with `` repository-url /im-
                        age  :tag `` . Up to 255 letters (uppercase and lower-
                        case), numbers, hyphens, underscores, colons, periods,
                        forward  slashes,  and  number signs are allowed. This
                        parameter maps to Image in the Create a container sec-
                        tion  of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter
                        of docker run .

                        NOTE:
                            Docker image architecture must match the processor
                            architecture of the compute resources that they're
                            scheduled on. For example, ARM-based Docker images
                            can only run on ARM-based compute resources.

                        o Images  in  Amazon  ECR  Public repositories use the
                          full registry/repository[:tag]  or  registry/reposi-
                          tory[@digest] naming conventions. For example,
                          ``
                          public.ecr.aws/registry_alias /my-web-app :latest ``
                          .

                          aws.com/<repository-name> ).

                        o Images  in official repositories on Docker Hub use a
                          single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo ).

                        o Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qual-
                          ified  with  an organization name (for example, ama-
                          zon/amazon-ecs-agent ).

                        o Images in other online  repositories  are  qualified
                          further  by  a domain name (for example, quay.io/as-
                          semblyline/ubuntu ).

                        Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. This  pa-
                        rameter  maps  to  CpuShares in the Create a container
                        section of the Docker Remote API and the  --cpu-shares
                        option  to  docker  run  . The number of vCPUs must be
                        specified but can be specified in several places.  You
                        must specify it at least once for each node.

                        resources. For jobs running on EC2 resources, it spec-
                        ifies  the memory hard limit (in MiB) for a container.
                        If your container attempts  to  exceed  the  specified
                        number,  it's  terminated. You must specify at least 4
                        MiB of memory for a job using this parameter. The mem-
                        ory  hard limit can be specified in several places. It
                        must be specified for each node at least once.

                     command -> (list)
                        The command that's passed to the container.  This  pa-
                        rameter  maps to Cmd in the Create a container section
                        of the Docker Remote API and the COMMAND parameter  to

                        (string)

                     jobRoleArn -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the IAM role that
                        the container can assume for Amazon Web Services  per-
                        missions.  For  more  information,  see  IAM roles for

                        that Batch can assume. For jobs that  run  on  Fargate
                        resources,  you  must  provide  an execution role. For
                        more information, see Batch execution IAM role in  the
                        Batch User Guide .

                     volumes -> (list)
                        A list of data volumes used in a job.

                        (structure)
                            A  data  volume  used in a job's container proper-
                            ties.

                            host -> (structure)
                               The contents of the  host  parameter  determine
                               whether  your  data volume persists on the host
                               container instance and where it is  stored.  If
                               the  host  parameter  is empty, then the Docker
                               daemon assigns a host path for your  data  vol-
                               ume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to per-
                               sist after the containers  associated  with  it
                               stop running.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  parameter  isn't  applicable  to jobs
                                   that are running on Fargate  resources  and
                                   shouldn't be provided.

                               sourcePath -> (string)
                                   The  path  on  the  host container instance
                                   that's presented to the container. If  this
                                   parameter  is empty, then the Docker daemon
                                   has assigned a host path for you.  If  this
                                   parameter  contains  a  file location, then
                                   the data volume persists at  the  specified
                                   location on the host container instance un-
                                   til you delete it manually. If  the  source
                                   path  location  doesn't  exist  on the host
                                   container instance, the Docker daemon  cre-
                                   ates  it.  If  the location does exist, the
                                   contents of the source path folder are  ex-
                                   ported.

                                   NOTE:
                                      This  parameter isn't applicable to jobs

                            name -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  volume. It can be up to 255
                               letters long. It can contain uppercase and low-
                               ercase  letters,  numbers, hyphens (-), and un-
                               derscores (_). This name is referenced  in  the
                               sourceVolume  parameter of container definition
                               mountPoints .

                            efsVolumeConfiguration -> (structure)
                               This parameter is specified when you are  using
                               an  Amazon  Elastic File System file system for
                               job storage. Jobs that are running  on  Fargate
                               resources  must specify a platformVersion of at
                               least 1.4.0 .

                               fileSystemId -> (string)
                                   The Amazon EFS file system ID to use.

                               rootDirectory -> (string)
                                   The directory within the  Amazon  EFS  file
                                   system  to  mount as the root directory in-
                                   side the host. If this parameter  is  omit-
                                   ted,  the  root of the Amazon EFS volume is
                                   used instead. Specifying / has the same ef-
                                   fect  as omitting this parameter. The maxi-
                                   mum length is 4,096 characters.

                                   WARNING:
                                      If an EFS access point is  specified  in

                                   accessPointId -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  EFS access point ID to use.
                                      If an access  point  is  specified,  the

                               serve for the container. The values vary  based
                               on the type specified.
                                   type="GPU"

                               The  number of physical GPUs to reserve for the
                               container. The number of GPUs reserved for  all
                               containers in a job shouldn't exceed the number
                               of available GPUs on the compute resource  that
                               the job is launched on.

                               NOTE:
                                   GPUs  are  not  available for jobs that are

                               container. This parameter is supported for jobs
                               that are running on EC2 resources. If your con-
                               tainer attempts to exceed the memory specified,
                               the container  is  terminated.  This  parameter
                               maps  to  Memory in the Create a container sec-
                               tion of the Docker Remote API and the  --memory
                               option  to  docker  run  .  You must specify at
                               least 4 MiB of memory for a job.  This  is  re-
                               quired  but  can be specified in several places
                               for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must  be
                               specified for each node at least once. This pa-
                               rameter maps to Memory in  the  Create  a  con-
                               tainer section of the Docker Remote API and the
                               --memory option to docker run .

                        Linux-specific  modifications  that are applied to the
                        container, such as details for device mappings.

                        devices -> (list)
                            Any host devices to expose to the container.  This
                            parameter  maps  to  Devices  in the Create a con-
                            tainer section of the Docker Remote  API  and  the
                            --device option to docker run .

                            NOTE:
                               This  parameter  isn't  applicable to jobs that
                               are running on Fargate resources and  shouldn't
                               be provided.

                            (structure)

                               host device.

                               NOTE:
                                   This object isn't applicable to  jobs  that
                                   are   running   on  Fargate  resources  and
                                   shouldn't be provided.

                               hostPath -> (string)
                                   The path for the device on  the  host  con-
                                   tainer instance.

                               containerPath -> (string)
                                   The  path  inside the container that's used
                                   to expose the host device. By default,  the
                                   hostPath value is used.

                               permissions -> (list)
                                   The  explicit permissions to provide to the
                                   container for the device. By  default,  the
                                   container  has permissions for read , write
                                   , and mknod for the device.

                                   (string)

                        initProcessEnabled -> (boolean)
                            If true, run an init process inside the  container
                            that  forwards  signals  and reaps processes. This
                            parameter maps to the --init option to docker  run
                            .  This  parameter  requires  version  1.25 of the
                            Docker Remote API or greater on your container in-
                            stance.  To check the Docker Remote API version on
                            your container instance, log into  your  container
                            instance  and  run  the  following  command:  sudo
                            docker version | grep "Server API version"

                        sharedMemorySize -> (integer)
                            The value for the size (in MiB)  of  the  /dev/shm
                            volume.  This parameter maps to the --shm-size op-
                            tion to docker run .

                            NOTE:
                               This parameter isn't applicable  to  jobs  that
                               are  running on Fargate resources and shouldn't
                               be provided.

                        tmpfs -> (list)
                            The container path, mount options,  and  size  (in
                            MiB)  of  the  tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to
                            the --tmpfs option to docker run .

                            NOTE:

                            (structure)
                               The container path, mount options, and size  of
                               the tmpfs mount.

                               NOTE:

                                   The absolute file  path  in  the  container
                                   where the tmpfs volume is mounted.

                               size -> (integer)
                                   The size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.

                               mountOptions -> (list)
                                   The list of tmpfs volume mount options.

                                   (string)

                        maxSwap -> (integer)
                            The total amount of swap memory (in  MiB)  a  con-
                            tainer  can  use.  This parameter is translated to
                            the --memory-swap option to docker run  where  the
                            value  is the sum of the container memory plus the
                            maxSwap value. For more information, see `  --mem-
                            ory-swap                 details                <-
                            https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/re-
                            source_constraints/#--memory-swap-details>`__   in
                            the Docker documentation.

                            If a maxSwap value of 0  is  specified,  the  con-
                            tainer  doesn't use swap. Accepted values are 0 or
                            any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter  is
                            omitted,  the  container doesn't use the swap con-
                            figuration for the container instance it  is  run-
                            ning on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swap-
                            piness parameter to be used.

                            NOTE:
                               This parameter isn't applicable  to  jobs  that
                               are  running on Fargate resources and shouldn't
                               be provided.

                        swappiness -> (integer)
                            This allows you to tune a container's memory swap-
                            piness  behavior.  A  swappiness value of 0 causes
                            swapping not to happen  unless  absolutely  neces-
                            sary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be
                            swapped very  aggressively.  Accepted  values  are
                            whole  numbers  between 0 and 100 . If the swappi-
                            ness parameter isn't specified, a default value of
                            60 is used. If a value isn't specified for maxSwap
                            , then this parameter is ignored.  If  maxSwap  is
                            set to 0, the container doesn't use swap. This pa-
                            rameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option  to
                            docker run .

                            Consider  the  following  when  you use a per-con-
                            tainer swap configuration.

                            o Swap space must be enabled and allocated on  the
                              container instance for the containers to use.

                            NOTE:
                               The  Amazon  ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap
                               enabled by default. You must enable swap on the
                               instance to use this feature. For more informa-
                               tion, see Instance store swap  volumes  in  the
                               Amazon  EC2  User  Guide for Linux Instances or
                               How do I allocate memory to work as swap  space
                               in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?

                            o The swap space parameters are only supported for
                              job definitions using EC2 resources.

                            o If the maxSwap  and  swappiness  parameters  are
                              omitted  from  a  job definition, each container
                              will have a default swappiness value of 60,  and
                              the  total  swap  usage  will  be limited to two
                              times the memory reservation of the container.

                            NOTE:
                               This parameter isn't applicable  to  jobs  that
                               are  running on Fargate resources and shouldn't
                               be provided.

                     logConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The log configuration specification for the container.

                        This parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a  con-
                        tainer  section  of  the  Docker  Remote  API  and the
                        --log-driver option to docker run . By  default,  con-
                        tainers  use  the  same logging driver that the Docker
                        daemon uses. However the container might use a differ-
                        ent  logging driver than the Docker daemon by specify-
                        ing a log driver with this parameter in the  container
                        definition.  To  use  a different logging driver for a
                        container, the log system must be configured  properly
                        on  the  container  instance  (or  on  a different log
                        server for remote logging options). For more  informa-
                        tion  on the options for different supported log driv-
                        ers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker docu-
                        mentation.

                        NOTE:
                            Batch  currently  supports a subset of the logging
                            drivers available to the Docker daemon  (shown  in
                            the  LogConfiguration data type).

                        This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Re-
                        mote API or greater on  your  container  instance.  To
                        check  the Docker Remote API version on your container
                        instance, log into your container instance and run the
                        following  command: sudo docker version | grep "Server
                        API version"

                        NOTE:
                            The Amazon ECS container agent running on  a  con-
                            tainer  instance must register the logging drivers
                            available on that  instance  with  the  ECS_AVAIL-
                            ABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS  environment  variable before
                            containers placed on that instance can  use  these

                        logDriver -> (string)
                            The log driver to use for the container. The valid
                            values  listed  for this parameter are log drivers
                            that the Amazon ECS container agent  can  communi-
                            cate with by default.

                            The  supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd ,
                            gelf , json-file , journald , logentries ,  syslog
                            , and splunk .

                            NOTE:
                               If you have a custom driver that's  not  listed
                               earlier  that  you want to work with the Amazon
                               ECS container agent, you can  fork  the  Amazon
                               ECS container agent project that's available on
                               GitHub and  customize  it  to  work  with  that
                               driver.  We  encourage  you  to submit pull re-
                               quests for changes that you want  to  have  in-
                               cluded.  However,  Amazon  Web Services doesn't
                               currently support running  modified  copies  of
                               this software.

                            This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker
                            Remote API or greater on your container  instance.
                            To  check  the  Docker  Remote API version on your
                            container instance, log into  your  container  in-
                            stance  and run the following command: sudo docker
                            version | grep "Server API version"

                        options -> (map)

                               your  container.  Secrets  can  be exposed to a
                               container in the following ways:

                               o To inject sensitive data into your containers
                                 as  environment  variables,  use  the secrets
                                 container definition parameter.

                               o To reference sensitive information in the log
                                 configuration  of a container, use the secre-
                                 tOptions container definition parameter.

                                   The  secret to expose to the container. The
                                   supported values are either the full ARN of
                                   the  Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN
                                   of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services
                                   Systems Manager Parameter Store.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If  the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-

                                      the   same  Region  as  the  job  you're
                                      launching, then you can use  either  the
                                      full  ARN  or  name of the parameter. If
                                      the parameter exists in a different  Re-
                                      gion,  then  the full ARN must be speci-
                                      fied.

                     secrets -> (list)
                        The secrets for the container. For  more  information,

                                   Parameter Store  parameter  exists  in  the
                                   same  Region  as  the job you're launching,
                                   then you can use either  the  full  ARN  or
                                   name of the parameter. If the parameter ex-
                                   ists in a different Region, then  the  full
                                   ARN must be specified.

                     networkConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The network configuration for jobs that are running on
                        Fargate resources. Jobs that are running  on  EC2  re-
                        sources must not specify this parameter.

                        assignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether the job should have a public IP
                            address. For a job that is running on Fargate  re-
                            sources in a private subnet to send outbound traf-
                            fic to the internet (for  example,  to  pull  con-
                            tainer  images), the private subnet requires a NAT
                            gateway be attached to route requests to  the  in-
                            ternet.  For more information, see Amazon ECS task
                            networking . The default value is "DISABLED".

                     fargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The platform configuration for jobs that  are  running
                        on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 re-
                        sources must not specify this parameter.

                        platformVersion -> (string)
                            The Fargate platform version where  the  jobs  are
                            running.  A platform version is specified only for
                            jobs that are running on Fargate resources. If one
                            isn't  specified,  the  LATEST platform version is
                            used by default. This uses a recent, approved ver-
                            sion  of  the  Fargate  platform  for  compute re-
                            sources. For more information, see  Fargate  plat-

       --retry-strategy (structure)
          The retry strategy to use for failed jobs that  are  submitted  with
          this  job  definition.  Any retry strategy that's specified during a
          SubmitJob operation overrides the retry strategy defined here. If  a
          job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried.

          attempts -> (integer)
              The  number  of  times to move a job to the RUNNABLE status. You
              can specify between 1 and 10 attempts. If the value of  attempts
              is greater than one, the job is retried on failure the same num-
              ber of attempts as the value.

          evaluateOnExit -> (list)
              Array of up to 5 objects that specify conditions under which the
              job should be retried or failed. If this parameter is specified,
              then the attempts parameter must also be specified.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a set of conditions to be met,  and  an  action  to
                 take (RETRY or EXIT ) if all conditions are met.

                 onStatusReason -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the StatusReason
                     returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512  charac-
                     ters  in length. It can contain letters, numbers, periods
                     (.), colons (:), and white  space  (including  spaces  or
                     tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that
                     only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                     The string can be between 1 and 512 characters in length.

                 onReason -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the  Reason  re-
                     turned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512 characters
                     in length. It can contain letters, numbers, periods  (.),
                     colons  (:), and white space (including spaces and tabs).
                     It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so  that  only
                     the start of the string needs to be an exact match.

                     The string can be between 1 and 512 characters in length.

                 onExitCode -> (string)
                     Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal rep-
                     resentation of the ExitCode returned for a job. The  pat-
                     tern  can  be up to 512 characters in length. It can con-
                     tain only numbers, and can optionally end with an  aster-
                     isk  (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be
                     an exact match.

                     The string can be between 1 and 512 characters in length.

                 action -> (string)
                     Specifies the action to take if all of the specified con-
                     ditions (onStatusReason , onReason , and onExitCode ) are
                     met. The values aren't case sensitive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attempts=integer,evaluateOnExit=[{onStatusReason=string,onReason=string,onExitCode=string,action=string},{onStatusReason=string,onReason=string,onExitCode=string,action=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attempts": integer,
            "evaluateOnExit": [
              {
                "onStatusReason": "string",
                "onReason": "string",
                "onExitCode": "string",
                "action": "RETRY"|"EXIT"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --propagate-tags | --no-propagate-tags (boolean)
          Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job  defini-
          tion to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified,
          the tags are not propagated. Tags can  only  be  propagated  to  the
          tasks  during  task  creation. For tags with the same name, job tags
          are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of
          combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is
          moved to the FAILED state.

       --timeout (structure)
          The timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this  job
          definition,  after which Batch terminates your jobs if they have not
          finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn't retried.
          The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds. Any timeout config-
          uration that's specified during a  SubmitJob operation overrides the
          timeout  configuration  defined  here. For more information, see Job
          Timeouts in the Batch User Guide .

          attemptDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              The time duration in seconds (measured from  the  job  attempt's
              startedAt  timestamp)  after which Batch terminates your jobs if
              they have not finished. The minimum value for the timeout is  60
              seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attemptDurationSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attemptDurationSeconds": integer
          }

       --tags (map)
          The tags that you apply to the job definition to help you categorize
          and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and  an  op-
          tional  value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
          Resources in Batch User Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --platform-capabilities (list)
          The platform capabilities required by  the  job  definition.  If  no
          value  is  specified, it defaults to EC2 . To run the job on Fargate
          resources, specify FARGATE .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            EC2
            FARGATE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
