OPTIONS
       --arns (list)
          A list of up to 100 scheduling policy Amazon Resource Name (ARN) en-
          tries.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       schedulingPolicies -> (list)
          The list of scheduling policies.

          (structure)
              An object that represents a scheduling policy.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the scheduling policy.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduling  policy.  An
                 example is
                 ``
                 arn:aws   :batch:us-east-1   :123456789012   :scheduling-pol-
                 icy/HighPriority `` .

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 198)
                        Inline literal start-string without end-string.

              fairsharePolicy -> (structure)
                 The fair share policy for the scheduling policy.

                 shareDecaySeconds -> (integer)
                     The amount of time (in seconds) to  use  to  calculate  a
                     fair  share  percentage for each fair share identifier in
                     use. A value of zero (0) indicates that only current  us-
                     age  is  measured. The decay allows for more recently run
                     jobs to have more weight than jobs that ran earlier.  The
                     maximum supported value is 604800 (1 week).

                 computeReservation -> (integer)
                     A  value  used  to  reserve some of the available maximum
                     vCPU for fair share identifiers that aren't already used.

                     The reserved ratio is
                     ``
                     (computeReservation /100)^*ActiveFairShares* `` where  ``
                     ActiveFairShares  ``  is  the number of active fair share
                     identifiers.

                     System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 230)
                            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                            For example, a computeReservation value of 50  in-
                            dicates  that  Batch  reserves  50% of the maximum
                            available vCPU if  there's  only  one  fair  share
                            identifier.  It reserves 25% if there are two fair
                            share identifiers. It reserves 12.5% if there  are
                            three fair share identifiers. A computeReservation
                            value of 25 indicates that  Batch  should  reserve
                            25%  of the maximum available vCPU if there's only
                            one fair share identifier, 6.25% if there are  two
                            fair  share  identifiers,  and  1.56% if there are
                            three fair share identifiers.

                            The minimum value is 0 and the  maximum  value  is
                            99.

                 shareDistribution -> (list)
                     An  array  of  SharedIdentifier  objects that contain the
                     weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share
                     policy.  Fair share identifiers that aren't included have
                     a default weight of 1.0 .

                     (structure)
                        Specifies the weights for the fair  share  identifiers
                        for the fair share policy. Fair share identifiers that
                        aren't included have a default weight of 1.0 .

                        shareIdentifier -> (string)
                            A fair share identifier or fair  share  identifier
                            prefix.  If  the string ends with an asterisk (*),
                            this entry specifies the weight factor to use  for
                            fair  share  identifiers that start with that pre-
                            fix. The list of fair share identifiers in a  fair
                            share policy can't overlap. For example, you can't
                            have  one  that  specifies  a  shareIdentifier  of
                            UserA*  and  another that specifies a shareIdenti-
                            fier of UserA-1 .

                            There can be no more than 500 fair  share  identi-
                            fiers active in a job queue.

                            The  string is limited to 255 alphanumeric charac-
                            ters, and can be followed by an asterisk (*).

                        weightFactor -> (float)
                            The weight factor for the fair  share  identifier.
                            The  default  value  is  1.0.  A lower value has a
                            higher priority for compute resources.  For  exam-
                            ple,  jobs  that  use  a  share  identifier with a
                            weight factor of 0.125 (1/8) get 8 times the  com-
                            pute resources of jobs that use a share identifier
                            with a weight factor of 1.

                            The smallest supported value is  0.0001,  and  the
                            largest supported value is 999.9999.

              tags -> (map)
                 The  tags  that you apply to the scheduling policy to catego-
                 rize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a  key
                 and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging Ama-
                 zon Web Services resources in  Amazon  Web  Services  General
                 Reference .
