CREATE-JOB-QUEUE()                                          CREATE-JOB-QUEUE()



NAME
       create-job-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate
       one or more compute environments to the queue and assign  an  order  of
       preference for the compute environments.

       You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that
       the Batch scheduler places jobs onto its  associated  compute  environ-
       ments.  For  example,  if a compute environment is associated with more
       than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given pref-
       erence for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.

OPTIONS
       --job-queue-name (string)
          The  name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can
          contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens  (-),  and
          underscores (_).

       --state (string)
          The  state  of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED , it
          is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state  is  DISABLED  ,  new
          jobs  can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can
          finish.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --scheduling-policy-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair share scheduling  policy.
          Job  queues  that  don't have a scheduling policy are scheduled in a
          first-in, first-out (FIFO) model. After a job queue has a scheduling
          policy, it can be replaced but can't be removed.

          The format is
          ``
          aws:Partition :batch:Region :Account :scheduling-policy/Name `` .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 100)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 An  example  is aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:schedul-
                 ing-policy/MySchedulingPolicy .

                 A job queue without a scheduling policy  is  scheduled  as  a
                 FIFO job queue and can't have a scheduling policy added. Jobs
                 queues with a scheduling policy can have a maximum of 500 ac-
                 tive fair share identifiers. When the limit has been reached,
                 submissions of any jobs that add a new fair share  identifier
                 fail.

       --priority (integer)
          The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or
          a higher integer value for the  priority  parameter)  are  evaluated
          first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is
          determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a pri-
          ority  value  of  10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue
          with a priority value of 1 . All of the compute environments must be
          either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2
          and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

       --compute-environment-order (list)
          The set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their  or-
          der relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to
          determine which compute environment runs a specific job. Compute en-
          vironments  must be in the VALID state before you can associate them
          with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments
          with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2
          (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2  and  Far-
          gate compute environments can't be mixed.

          NOTE:
              All  compute  environments  that are associated with a job queue
              must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't  support  mixing
              compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.

          (structure)
              The  order that compute environments are tried in for job place-
              ment within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending
              order.  For  example, if two compute environments are associated
              with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order in-
              teger  value  is tried for job placement first. Compute environ-
              ments must be in the VALID state before you can  associate  them
              with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either
              EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); Amazon
              EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.

              NOTE:
                 All compute environments that are associated with a job queue
                 must share the same architecture. Batch doesn't support  mix-
                 ing  compute  environment  architecture types in a single job
                 queue.

              order -> (integer)
                 The order of the compute  environment.  Compute  environments
                 are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute en-
                 vironments are associated with a job queue, the compute envi-
                 ronment  with  a  lower  order integer value is tried for job
                 placement first.

              computeEnvironment -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          The tags that you apply to the job queue to help you categorize  and
          organize  your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
          value. For more information, see Tagging  your  Batch  resources  in
          Batch User Guide .

       --job-state-time-limit-actions (list)
          The  set  of  actions that Batch performs on jobs that remain at the
          head of the job queue in the specified state longer  than  specified
          times.  Batch  will  perform  each  action  after maxTimeSeconds has
          passed. (Note : The minimum value for maxTimeSeconds is 600 (10 min-
          utes) and its maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).)

          (structure)
              Specifies  an  action that Batch will take after the job has re-
              mained at the head of the  queue  in  the  specified  state  for
              longer than the specified time.

              reason -> (string)
                 The reason to log for the action being taken.

              state -> (string)
                 The  state  of the job needed to trigger the action. The only
                 supported value is RUNNABLE .

              maxTimeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The approximate amount of time, in seconds,  that  must  pass
                 with  the  job  in  the  specified state before the action is
                 taken. The minimum value is 600 (10 minutes) and the  maximum
                 value is 86,400 (24 hours).

              action -> (string)
                 The action to take when a job is at the head of the job queue
                 in the specified state for the specified period of time.  The
                 only supported value is CANCEL , which will cancel the job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          reason=string,state=string,maxTimeSeconds=integer,action=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "reason": "string",
              "state": "RUNNABLE",
              "maxTimeSeconds": integer,
              "action": "CANCEL"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a low priority job queue with a single compute environment

       This example creates a job  queue  called  LowPriority  that  uses  the
       M4Spot compute environment.

       Command:

          aws batch create-job-queue --cli-input-json file://<path_to_json_file>/LowPriority.json

       JSON file format:

          {
            "jobQueueName": "LowPriority",
            "state": "ENABLED",
            "priority": 10,
            "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
              {
                "order": 1,
                "computeEnvironment": "M4Spot"
              }
            ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/LowPriority",
              "jobQueueName": "LowPriority"
          }

       To create a high priority job queue with two compute environments

       This  example  creates  a  job  queue called HighPriority that uses the
       C4OnDemand compute environment with an order of 1 and the  M4Spot  com-
       pute  environment  with  an  order  of 2. The scheduler will attempt to
       place jobs on the C4OnDemand compute environment first.

       Command:

          aws batch create-job-queue --cli-input-json file://<path_to_json_file>/HighPriority.json

       JSON file format:

          {
            "jobQueueName": "HighPriority",
            "state": "ENABLED",
            "priority": 1,
            "computeEnvironmentOrder": [
              {
                "order": 1,
                "computeEnvironment": "C4OnDemand"
              },
              {
                "order": 2,
                "computeEnvironment": "M4Spot"
              }
            ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "jobQueueArn": "arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:012345678910:job-queue/HighPriority",
              "jobQueueName": "HighPriority"
          }
