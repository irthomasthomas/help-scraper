DEPLOY-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()                              DEPLOY-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()



NAME
       deploy-system-instance -

DESCRIPTION
          Greengrass and Cloud Deployments

       Deploys  the  system  instance  to  the  target specified in CreateSys-
       temInstance .
          Greengrass Deployments

       If the system or any workflows and entities have  been  updated  before
       this  action  is  called,  then the deployment will create a new Amazon
       Simple Storage Service resource file and then deploy it.

       Since this action creates a Greengrass deployment on the  caller's  be-
       half, the calling identity must have write permissions to the specified
       Greengrass group. Otherwise, the call will fail with  an  authorization
       error.

       For  information  about the artifacts that get added to your Greengrass
       core device when you use this API, see AWS IoT Things Graph and AWS IoT
       Greengrass .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deploy-system-instance
          [--id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID  of  the system instance. This value is returned by the Cre-
          ateSystemInstance action.

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:deployment:DEPLOYMENTNAME

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To deploy a system instance

       The following delete-system-template example deploys a system instance.

          aws iotthingsgraph deploy-system-instance \
              --id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218"

       Output:

          {
             "summary": {
                "arn": "arn:aws:iotthingsgraph:us-west-2:123456789012:Deployment:Room218",
                "createdAt": 1559249776.254,
                "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218",
                "status": "DEPLOYED_IN_TARGET",
                "target": "CLOUD",
                "updatedAt": 1559249776.254
             }
          }
