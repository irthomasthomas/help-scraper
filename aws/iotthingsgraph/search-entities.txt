SEARCH-ENTITIES()                                            SEARCH-ENTITIES()



NAME
       search-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for  entities of the specified type. You can search for enti-
       ties in your namespace and the public namespace that you're tracking.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-entities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: descriptions

OPTIONS
       --entity-types (list)
          The entity types for which to search.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            DEVICE
            SERVICE
            DEVICE_MODEL
            CAPABILITY
            STATE
            ACTION
            EVENT
            PROPERTY
            MAPPING
            ENUM

       --filters (list)
          Optional  filter  to  apply  to  the  search. Valid filters are NAME
          NAMESPACE , SEMANTIC_TYPE_PATH  and  REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID  .  REFER-
          ENCED_ENTITY_ID  filters  on entities that are used by the entity in
          the result set. For example, you can filter on the ID of a  property
          that is used in a state.

          Multiple filters function as OR criteria in the query. Multiple val-
          ues passed inside the filter function as AND criteria.

          (structure)
              An object that filters an entity search. Multiple filters  func-
              tion as OR criteria in the search. For example a search that in-
              cludes a NAMESPACE and a  REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID  filter  searches
              for  entities  in  the  specified  namespace that use the entity
              specified by the value of REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the entity search  filter  field.  REFERENCED_EN-
                 TITY_ID  filters  on  entities that are used by the entity in
                 the result set. For example, you can filter on the  ID  of  a
                 property that is used in a state.

              value -> (list)
                 An array of string values for the search filter field. Multi-
                 ple values function as AND criteria in the search.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "NAME"|"NAMESPACE"|"SEMANTIC_TYPE_PATH"|"REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID",
              "value": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --namespace-version (long)
          The version of the user's namespace. Defaults to the latest  version
          of the user's namespace.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To search for entities

       The following search-entities example searches for all entities of type
       EVENT.

          aws iotthingsgraph search-entities \
              --entity-types "EVENT"
