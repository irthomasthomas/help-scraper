CREATE-FLOW-TEMPLATE()                                  CREATE-FLOW-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-flow-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  workflow  template.  Workflows  can  be created only in the
       user's namespace. (The public namespace contains  only  entities.)  The
       workflow  can  contain  only  entities  in the specified namespace. The
       workflow is validated against the entities in the latest version of the
       user's  namespace  unless another namespace version is specified in the
       request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --definition (structure)
          The workflow DefinitionDocument .

          language -> (string)
              The language used to define the  entity.  GRAPHQL  is  the  only
              valid value.

          text -> (string)
              The GraphQL text that defines the entity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          language=string,text=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "language": "GRAPHQL",
            "text": "string"
          }

       --compatible-namespace-version (long)
          The namespace version in which the workflow is to be created.

          If no value is specified, the latest version is used by default.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a flow

       The  following  create-flow-template example creates a flow (workflow).
       The value of MyFlowDefinition is the GraphQL that models the flow.

          aws iotthingsgraph create-flow-template \
              --definition language=GRAPHQL,text="MyFlowDefinition"

       Output:

          {
              "summary": {
                  "createdAt": 1559248067.545,
                  "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Workflow:MyFlow",
                  "revisionNumber": 1
              }
          }

       Graph User Guide.

          arn -> (string)
