OPTIONS
       --configuration (structure)
          Configuration  for  profile jobs. Used to select columns, do evalua-
          tions, and override default parameters of evaluations. When configu-
          ration is null, the profile job will run with default settings.

          DatasetStatisticsConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration for inter-column evaluations. Configuration can be
              used to select evaluations and override  parameters  of  evalua-
              tions. When configuration is undefined, the profile job will run
              all supported inter-column evaluations.

              IncludedStatistics -> (list)
                 List of included evaluations. When the list is undefined, all
                 supported evaluations will be included.

                 (string)

              Overrides -> (list)
                 List of overrides for evaluations.

              columns  from the dataset. When ProfileColumns is undefined, the
              profile job will profile all supported columns.

              (structure)
                 Selector of a column from a dataset for profile job  configu-
                 ration. One selector includes either a column name or a regu-
                 lar expression.

              StatisticsConfigurations is undefined, the profile job will pro-
              file all supported columns and run all supported evaluations.

              (structure)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
