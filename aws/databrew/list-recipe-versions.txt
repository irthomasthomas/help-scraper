LIST-RECIPE-VERSIONS()                                  LIST-RECIPE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-recipe-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  versions  of  a particular DataBrew recipe, except for LAT-
       EST_WORKING .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-recipe-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Recipes

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the recipe for which to return version information.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

                        NOTE:
                            All of the conditions in the array must be met. In
                            other words, all of the conditions  must  be  com-

                            Conditions are used with recipe actions.  The  ac-
                            tion is only performed for column values where the
                            condition evaluates to true.

                            If a recipe requires more than one condition, then
                            the  recipe must specify multiple ConditionExpres-
                            sion elements. Each condition is  applied  to  the
                            rows  in a dataset first, before the recipe action
                            is performed.

                            Condition -> (string)
                               A specific condition to apply to a  recipe  ac-
                               tion.  For  more information, see Recipe struc-
                               ture in the Glue DataBrew Developer Guide .

                            Value -> (string)
                               A value that the condition must evaluate to for
                               the condition to succeed.

                            TargetColumn -> (string)
                               A column to apply this condition to.

              Tags -> (map)

                 value -> (string)

              RecipeVersion -> (string)
                 The identifier for the version for the recipe. Must be one of
                 the following:

                 o Numeric version (X.Y ) - X and Y stand for major and  minor
                   version  numbers.  The  maximum length of each is 6 digits,
                   and neither can be negative values. Both X and  Y  are  re-
                   quired, and "0.0" isn't a valid version.

                 o LATEST_WORKING - the most recent valid version being devel-
                   oped in a DataBrew project.

                 o LATEST_PUBLISHED - the most recent published version.
