DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus-com-
       patible monitoring service for container metrics that makes  it  easier
       to  securely  monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon Man-
       aged  Service  for  Prometheus,  you  can  use  the  same   open-source
       Prometheus  data model and query language that you use today to monitor
       the performance of your containerized workloads,  and  also  enjoy  im-
       proved scalability, availability, and security without having to manage
       the underlying infrastructure.

       For more information about Amazon Managed Service for  Prometheus,  see
       the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide.
