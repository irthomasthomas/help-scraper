DELETE-CERTIFICATE()                                      DELETE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       delete-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  certificate  and its associated private key. If this action
       succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the  list  that  can  be
       displayed  by  calling  the  ListCertificates action or be retrieved by
       calling the  GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be  avail-
       able for use by Amazon Web Services services integrated with ACM.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  delete an ACM certificate that is being used by another
          Amazon Web Services service. To delete a certificate that is in use,
          the certificate association must first be removed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          String  that  contains the ARN of the ACM certificate to be deleted.
          This must be of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
