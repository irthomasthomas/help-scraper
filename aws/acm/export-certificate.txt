EXPORT-CERTIFICATE()                                      EXPORT-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       export-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports a private certificate issued by a private certificate authority
       (CA) for use anywhere. The exported file contains the certificate,  the
       certificate  chain,  and the encrypted private 2048-bit RSA key associ-
       ated with the public key that is embedded in the certificate. For secu-
       rity,  you  must assign a passphrase for the private key when exporting
       it.

       For information about exporting and formatting a certificate using  the
       ACM console or CLI, see Export a Private Certificate .

          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          An  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the issued certificate. This must
          be of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:account:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --passphrase (blob)
          Passphrase to associate with the encrypted exported private key.

          NOTE:
              When  creating  your passphrase, you can use any ASCII character
              except #, $, or %.

          If you want to later decrypt the private  key,  you  must  have  the
          passphrase.  You  can use the following OpenSSL command to decrypt a
          private key. After entering the command, you are  prompted  for  the
          passphrase.
              openssl rsa -in encrypted_key.pem -out decrypted_key.pem

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To export a private certificate issued by a private CA.

       The following export-certificate command exports a private certificate,
       certificate chain, and private key to your display:

          aws acm export-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --passphrase file://path-to-passphrase-file

       To  export the certificate, chain, and private key to a local file, use
       the following command:

          aws acm export-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:region:sccount:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --passphrase file://path-to-passphrase-file > c:\temp\export.txt

OUTPUT
       Certificate -> (string)
          The base64 PEM-encoded certificate.

       CertificateChain -> (string)
          The base64 PEM-encoded certificate chain. This does not include  the
          certificate that you are exporting.

       PrivateKey -> (string)
          The encrypted private key associated with the public key in the cer-
          tificate. The key is output in PKCS #8 format and is base64  PEM-en-
          coded.
