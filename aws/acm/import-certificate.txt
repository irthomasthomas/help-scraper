IMPORT-CERTIFICATE()                                      IMPORT-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       import-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports  a  certificate into Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with ser-
       vices that are integrated with ACM. Note that integrated services allow
       only  certificate  types  and  keys  they support to be associated with
       their resources. Further, their support differs  depending  on  whether
       the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information,
       see the documentation for each service. For more information about  im-
       porting  certificates  into ACM, see Importing Certificates in the Cer-
       tificate Manager User Guide .

       NOTE:
          ACM does not provide managed renewal for certificates that  you  im-
          port.

       Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

       o You  must  enter the private key that matches the certificate you are
         importing.

       o The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private  key
         that is protected by a password or a passphrase.

       o The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).

       o If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must en-
         ter its certificate chain.

       o If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of
         one of the certificates in the chain.

       o The  certificate,  private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-en-
         coded.

       o The current time must be between the Not Before and  Not  After  cer-
         tificate fields.

       o The Issuer field must not be empty.

       o The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.

       o To  import  a  new certificate, omit the CertificateArn argument. In-
         clude this argument only when you want to replace  a  previously  im-
         ported certificate.

       o When  you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the
         certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file
         names  preceded by fileb:// . For example, you can specify a certifi-
         cate  saved  in  the  C:\temp  folder   as   fileb://C:\temp\certifi-
         cate_to_import.pem  .  If  you  are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query re-
         quest, include these arguments as BLOBs.

       o When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must  specify  the
         certificate,  the certificate chain, and the private key files in the
         manner required by the programming language you're using.

       o The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the
         algorithm  of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type
         is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.

       This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  imported
       certificate.

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of an imported certificate to re-
          place. To import a new certificate, omit this field.

       --certificate (blob)
          The certificate to import.

       --private-key (blob)
          The private key that matches the public key in the certificate.

       --certificate-chain (blob)
          The PEM encoded certificate chain.

       --tags (list)
          One or more resource tags to associate with  the  imported  certifi-
          cate.

          Note: You cannot apply tags when reimporting a certificate.

          (structure)
              A  key-value pair that identifies or specifies metadata about an
              ACM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To import a certificate into ACM.

       The following import-certificate command  imports  a  certificate  into
       ACM. Replace the file names with your own:

          aws acm import-certificate --certificate file://Certificate.pem --certificate-chain file://CertificateChain.pem --private-key file://PrivateKey.pem

OUTPUT
       CertificateArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate.
