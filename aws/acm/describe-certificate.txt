DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()                                  DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       describe-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed metadata about the specified ACM certificate.

       If you have just created a certificate using the RequestCertificate ac-
       tion, there is a delay of several seconds before you can  retrieve  in-
       formation about it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. The ARN must
          have the following form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              name that occurs as a result of the  RequestCertificate request.
              This field exists only when the certificate type  is  AMAZON_IS-
              SUED .

              (structure)

                     o SUCCESS

                     o FAILED

                 ResourceRecord -> (structure)
                     Contains the CNAME record that you add to your DNS  data-
                     base for domain validation. For more information, see Use
                     DNS to Validate Domain Ownership .

                     Note: The CNAME information that you need  does  not  in-
                     clude the name of your domain. If you include your domain
                     name in the DNS database CNAME record, validation  fails.
                     For       example,       if       the       name       is
                     "_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96.yourdomain.com",  only
                     "_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96" must be used.

              The name of the certificate authority that issued and signed the
              certificate.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the certificate was requested.

          IssuedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  time at which the certificate was issued. This value exists
              only when the certificate type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

          ImportedAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the certificate was imported. This  value
              exists only when the certificate type is IMPORTED .

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the certificate.

              A  certificate  enters  status PENDING_VALIDATION upon being re-
              quested, unless it fails for any of the  reasons  given  in  the
              troubleshooting  topic Certificate request fails . ACM makes re-
              peated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and  then
              times  out.  If  a  certificate  shows  status FAILED or VALIDA-
              TION_TIMED_OUT, delete the request, correct the issue  with  DNS
              validation  or  Email  validation , and try again. If validation
              succeeds, the certificate enters status ISSUED.

              The time before which the certificate is not valid.

          NotAfter -> (timestamp)
              The time after which the certificate is not valid.

          KeyAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that was used to generate the  public-private  key
              pair.

          SignatureAlgorithm -> (string)
              The algorithm that was used to sign the certificate.

          InUseBy -> (list)
              A  list  of  ARNs for the Amazon Web Services resources that are
              using the certificate. A certificate can  be  used  by  multiple
              Amazon Web Services resources.

              (string)

          FailureReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the  certificate  request failed. This value exists
              only when the certificate status is FAILED . For  more  informa-
              tion,  see Certificate Request Failed in the Certificate Manager
              User Guide .

          Type -> (string)

              this value is AMAZON_ISSUED . For certificates that you imported
              with  ImportCertificate , this value is IMPORTED . ACM does  not
              provide  managed renewal for imported certificates. For more in-
              formation about the differences between  certificates  that  you
              import  and  those that ACM provides, see Importing Certificates
              in the Certificate Manager User Guide .

          RenewalSummary -> (structure)
              Contains information about the status of ACM's  managed  renewal
              for the certificate. This field exists only when the certificate
              type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

              RenewalStatus -> (string)
                 The status of ACM's managed renewal of the certificate.

              DomainValidationOptions -> (list)
                 Contains information about the validation of each domain name
                 in the certificate, as it pertains to ACM's managed renewal .
                 This is different from the initial validation that occurs  as
                 a  result  of the  RequestCertificate request. This field ex-
                 ists only when the certificate type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

                        tion emails.

                     ValidationStatus -> (string)
                        The validation status of the domain name. This can  be
                        one of the following values:

                        o PENDING_VALIDATION

                        see Use DNS to Validate Domain Ownership .

                        Note: The CNAME information that you need does not in-
                        clude the name of your domain. If you include your do-
                        main name in the DNS database CNAME record, validation
                        fails.    For    example,    if    the     name     is

                     A string value that contains a Key Usage extension name.

          ExtendedKeyUsages -> (list)
              Contains  a  list  of  Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension ob-
              jects. Each object specifies a purpose for which the certificate
              public  key  can  be  used  and consists of a name and an object
              identifier (OID).

              (structure)
                 The Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension defines one or more

                 ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          RenewalEligibility -> (string)
              Specifies whether the certificate is eligible  for  renewal.  At
              this  time,  only  exported  private certificates can be renewed
              with the  RenewCertificate command.

          Options -> (structure)
              Value that specifies whether to add the certificate to a  trans-
              parency  log.  Certificate transparency makes it possible to de-
              tect SSL certificates that have been mistakenly  or  maliciously
              issued. A browser might respond to certificate that has not been
              logged by showing an error message. The logs  are  cryptographi-
              cally secure.

              CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference -> (string)
                 You can opt out of certificate transparency logging by speci-
                 fying the DISABLED option. Opt in by specifying ENABLED .
