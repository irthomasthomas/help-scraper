REQUEST-CERTIFICATE()                                    REQUEST-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       request-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services ser-
       vices. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a  fully  quali-
       fied domain name (FQDN) in the DomainName parameter. You can also spec-
       ify additional FQDNs in the SubjectAlternativeNames parameter.

       If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation  is  not
       required.  If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name
       that you specify must be validated to verify that you  own  or  control
       the  domain. You can use DNS validation or email validation . We recom-
       mend that you use DNS validation. ACM issues public certificates  after
       receiving approval from the domain owner.

       NOTE:
          ACM behavior differs from the RFC 6125 specification of the certifi-
          cate validation process. ACM first checks for a Subject  Alternative
          Name, and, if it finds one, ignores the common name (CN).

       After  successful completion of the RequestCertificate action, there is
       a delay of several seconds before you can  retrieve  information  about
       the new certificate.

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          Fully  qualified  domain  name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that
          you want to secure with an ACM certificate. Use an asterisk  (*)  to
          create  a  wildcard  certificate  that protects several sites in the
          same domain. For example,
          *
          .example.com protects  www.example.com,  site.example.com,  and  im-
          ages.example.com.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 86)
                 Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 In  compliance  with RFC 5280 , the length of the domain name
                 (technically, the Common Name) that you provide cannot exceed
                 64  octets  (characters),  including periods. To add a longer
                 domain name, specify  it  in  the  Subject  Alternative  Name
                 field, which supports names up to 253 octets in length.

       --validation-method (string)
          The  method  you want to use if you are requesting a public certifi-
          cate to validate that you own or control domain.  You  can  validate
          with DNS or validate with email . We recommend that you use DNS val-
          idation.

          Possible values:

          o EMAIL

          o DNS

       --subject-alternative-names (list)
          Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name  ex-
          tension  of the ACM certificate. For example, add the name www.exam-
          ple.net to a certificate for which the DomainName field is www.exam-
          ple.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maxi-
          mum number of domain names that you can add to an ACM certificate is
          100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more
          than 10 names, you must request a quota increase. For more  informa-
          tion, see Quotas .

          The maximum length of a SAN DNS name is 253 octets. The name is made
          up of multiple labels separated by periods. No label can  be  longer
          than 63 octets. Consider the following examples:

          o (63  octets).(63  octets).(63 octets).(61 octets) is legal because
            the total length is 253 octets (63+1+63+1+63+1+61)  and  no  label
            exceeds 63 octets.

          o (64  octets).(63  octets).(63 octets).(61 octets) is not legal be-
            cause the total length exceeds 253 octets (64+1+63+1+63+1+61)  and
            the first label exceeds 63 octets.

          o (63  octets).(63  octets).(63 octets).(62 octets) is not legal be-
            cause the total length of the DNS name (63+1+63+1+63+1+62) exceeds
            253 octets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --idempotency-token (string)
          Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls
          to RequestCertificate . Idempotency tokens time out after one  hour.
          Therefore,  if  you  call RequestCertificate multiple times with the
          same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you  are
          requesting  only  one  certificate  and  will issue only one. If you
          change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that  you
          are requesting multiple certificates.

       --domain-validation-options (list)
          The  domain name that you want ACM to use to send you emails so that
          you can validate domain ownership.

          (structure)
              Contains information about the domain names that you want ACM to
              use to send you emails that enable you to validate domain owner-
              ship.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the  certificate  re-
                 quest.

              ValidationDomain -> (string)
                 The  domain name that you want ACM to use to send you valida-
                 tion emails. This domain name is the suffix of the email  ad-
                 dresses  that  you  want ACM to use. This must be the same as
                 the DomainName value  or  a  superdomain  of  the  DomainName
                 value.  For  example,  if you request a certificate for test-
                 ing.example.com , you can specify example.com for this value.
                 In  that case, ACM sends domain validation emails to the fol-
                 lowing five addresses:

                 o admin@example.com

                 o administrator@example.com

                 o hostmaster@example.com

                 o postmaster@example.com

                 o webmaster@example.com

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainName=string,ValidationDomain=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "DomainName": "string",
              "ValidationDomain": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --options (structure)
          Currently, you can use this parameter to specify whether to add  the
          certificate to a certificate transparency log. Certificate transpar-
          ency makes it possible to detect SSL/TLS certificates that have been
          mistakenly  or  maliciously  issued. Certificates that have not been
          logged typically produce an error message in a browser. For more in-
          formation, see Opting Out of Certificate Transparency Logging .

          CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference -> (string)
              You  can opt out of certificate transparency logging by specify-
              ing the DISABLED option. Opt in by specifying ENABLED .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private certificate  authority
          (CA)  that will be used to issue the certificate. If you do not pro-
          vide an ARN and you are trying to request a private certificate, ACM
          will  attempt  to  issue  a public certificate. For more information
          about private CAs, see the Amazon Web Services  Private  Certificate
          Authority user guide. The ARN must have the following form:
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region:account:certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       --tags (list)
          One or more resource tags to associate with the certificate.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that identifies or specifies metadata about  an
              ACM resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --key-algorithm (string)
          Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your
          certificate uses to encrypt data. RSA is the default  key  algorithm
          for  ACM  certificates.  Elliptic  Curve Digital Signature Algorithm
          (ECDSA) keys are smaller, offering security comparable to  RSA  keys
          but  with  greater  computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not sup-
          ported by all network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services may
          require  RSA  keys, or only support ECDSA keys of a particular size,
          while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA  keys  to  ensure
          that  compatibility  is  not  broken. Check the requirements for the
          Amazon Web Services service where you plan to deploy  your  certifi-
          cate. For more information about selecting an algorithm, see Key al-
          gorithms .

          NOTE:
              Algorithms supported for an ACM certificate request include:

              o RSA_2048

              o EC_prime256v1

              o EC_secp384r1

              Other listed algorithms are for imported certificates only.

          NOTE:
              When you request a private PKI certificate signed by a  CA  from
              Amazon  Web Services Private CA, the specified signing algorithm
              family (RSA or ECDSA) must match the  algorithm  family  of  the
              CA's secret key.

          Default: RSA_2048

          Possible values:

          o RSA_1024

          o RSA_2048

          o RSA_3072

          o RSA_4096

          o EC_prime256v1

          o EC_secp384r1

          o EC_secp521r1

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To request a new ACM certificate

       The  following  request-certificate  command requests a new certificate
       for the www.example.com domain using DNS validation:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name www.example.com --validation-method DNS

       You can enter an idempotency token to distinguish between calls to  re-
       quest-certificate:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name www.example.com --validation-method DNS --idempotency-token 91adc45q

       You  can  enter one or more subject alternative names to request a cer-
       tificate that will protect more than one apex domain:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS --idempotency-token 91adc45q --subject-alternative-names www.example.net

       You can enter an alternative name that can also be used to  reach  your
       website:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS --idempotency-token 91adc45q --subject-alternative-names www.example.com

       You  can  use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to create a certificate for
       several subdomains in the same domain:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS --idempotency-token 91adc45q --subject-alternative-names *.example.com

       You can also enter multiple alternative names:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method DNS --subject-alternative-names b.example.com c.example.com d.example.com

       If you are using email for validation, you can enter domain  validation
       options  to  specify  the  domain to which the validation email will be
       sent:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --validation-method EMAIL --subject-alternative-names www.example.com --domain-validation-options DomainName=example.com,ValidationDomain=example.com

       The following command opts out of certificate transparency logging when
       you request a new certificate:

          aws acm request-certificate --domain-name www.example.com --validation-method DNS --options CertificateTransparencyLoggingPreference=DISABLED --idempotency-token 184627

OUTPUT
       CertificateArn -> (string)
          String that contains the ARN of the issued certificate. This must be
          of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
