OPTIONS
       --alias (string)
          An  alias that you assign to this workspace to help you identify it.
          It does not need to be unique.

          Blank spaces at the beginning or end of the alias that  you  specify
          will be trimmed from the value used.

       --client-token (string)
          A  unique  identifier that you can provide to ensure the idempotency
          of the request. Case-sensitive.

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          (optional) The ARN for a customer managed KMS key  to  use  for  en-
          crypting  data within your workspace. For more information about us-
          ing your own key in your workspace, see Encryption at  rest  in  the
          Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide .

       --tags (map)
          The list of tag keys and values to associate with the workspace.

          key -> (string)
              The key of the tag. Must not begin with aws: .

          value -> (string)
              The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       arn -> (string)
          The ARN for the new workspace.

       kmsKeyArn -> (string)
