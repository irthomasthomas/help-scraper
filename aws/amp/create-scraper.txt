CREATE-SCRAPER()                                              CREATE-SCRAPER()



NAME
       create-scraper -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateScraper  operation  creates  a scraper to collect metrics. A
       scraper pulls metrics from Prometheus-compatible sources within an Ama-
       zon  EKS  cluster,  and  sends  them to your Amazon Managed Service for
       Prometheus workspace. You can configure the  scraper  to  control  what
       metrics  are  collected,  and what transformations are applied prior to
       sending them to your workspace.

       If needed, an IAM role will be created for you that gives  Amazon  Man-
       aged  Service for Prometheus access to the metrics in your cluster. For
       more information, see Using roles for scraping metrics from EKS in  the
       Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User Guide .

       You cannot update a scraper. If you want to change the configuration of
       the scraper, create a new scraper and delete the old one.

       The scrapeConfiguration parameter contains the  base64-encoded  version
       of the YAML configuration file.

       NOTE:
          For  more  information  about collectors, including what metrics are
          collected, and how to configure the scraper, see Amazon Web Services
          managed collectors in the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus User
          Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command

       the string will be taken literally.

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
