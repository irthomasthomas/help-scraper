OPTIONS
       --contact-list-name (string)
          The name of the contact list.

       --filter (structure)
          A filter that can be applied to a list of contacts.

          FilteredStatus -> (string)
              The status by which you are filtering: OPT_IN or OPT_OUT .

          TopicFilter -> (structure)
              Used for filtering by a specific topic preference.

              TopicName -> (string)
                 The name of a topic on which you wish to apply the filter.

              UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable -> (boolean)
                 Notes  that the default subscription status should be applied
                 to a contact because the contact has not noted their  prefer-
                 ence for subscribing to a topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FilteredStatus=string,TopicFilter={TopicName=string,UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FilteredStatus": "OPT_IN"|"OPT_OUT",
            "TopicFilter": {
              "TopicName": "string",
              "UseDefaultIfPreferenceUnavailable": true|false
            }
          }

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of contacts that may be returned at once, which is depen-
          dent on if there are more or less contacts than the value of the Pa-
          geSize.  Use  this parameter to paginate results. If additional con-
          tacts exist beyond the specified limit,  the  NextToken  element  is
          sent in the response. Use the NextToken value in subsequent requests
          to retrieve additional contacts.

       --next-token (string)
          A string token indicating that there might  be  additional  contacts
          available  to  be  listed. Use the token provided in the Response to
          use in the subsequent call to ListContacts with the same  parameters
          to retrieve the next page of contacts.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       The formatting style for command output.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
