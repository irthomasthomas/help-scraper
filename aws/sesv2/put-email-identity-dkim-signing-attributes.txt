OPTIONS
       --email-identity (string)
          The email identity.

       --signing-attributes-origin (string)
          The method to use to configure DKIM for the identity. There are  the
          following possible values:

          o AWS_SES  Configure DKIM for the identity by using Easy DKIM .

          o EXTERNAL   Configure DKIM for the identity by using Bring Your Own
            DKIM (BYODKIM).

          Possible values:

          o AWS_SES

          o EXTERNAL

       --signing-attributes (structure)
          An object that contains information about the private key and selec-
          tor  that  you  want  to  use to configure DKIM for the identity for
          Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM) for the identity, or,  configures  the
          key length to be used for Easy DKIM .

          DomainSigningSelector -> (string)
              [Bring  Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a public
              key in the DNS configuration for a domain.

          DomainSigningPrivateKey -> (string)
              [Bring Your Own DKIM] A private key that's used  to  generate  a
              DKIM signature.

              The  private  key  must use 1024 or 2048-bit RSA encryption, and
              must be encoded using base64 encoding.

          NextSigningKeyLength -> (string)
              [Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM  key  pair  to  be
              generated. This can be changed at most once per day.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DomainSigningSelector=string,DomainSigningPrivateKey=string,NextSigningKeyLength=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DomainSigningSelector": "string",
            "DomainSigningPrivateKey": "string",
            "NextSigningKeyLength": "RSA_1024_BIT"|"RSA_2048_BIT"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       DkimStatus -> (string)
          The  DKIM  authentication  status of the identity. Amazon SES deter-
          mines the authentication status by searching for specific records in
          the  DNS configuration for your domain. If you used Easy DKIM to set
          up DKIM authentication, Amazon SES tries to find three unique  CNAME
          records in the DNS configuration for your domain.

          If  you provided a public key to perform DKIM authentication, Amazon
          SES tries to find a TXT record that uses the selector that you spec-
          ified.  The  value  of  the  TXT  record must be a public key that's
          paired with the private key that you specified  in  the  process  of
          creating the identity.

          The status can be one of the following:

          o PENDING   The  verification  process was initiated, but Amazon SES
            hasn't yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration  for
            the domain.

          o SUCCESS  The verification process completed successfully.

          o FAILED   The  verification  process  failed. This typically occurs
            when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configu-
            ration of the domain.

          o TEMPORARY_FAILURE  A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from
            determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.

          o NOT_STARTED  The DKIM verification process hasn't  been  initiated
            for the domain.

       DkimTokens -> (list)
          If  you  used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication for the do-
          main, then this object contains a set of unique strings that you use
          to  create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configura-
          tion for your domain. When Amazon SES detects these records  in  the
          DNS  configuration  for your domain, the DKIM authentication process
          is complete.

          If you configured DKIM authentication for the  domain  by  providing
          your  own public-private key pair, then this object contains the se-
          lector that's associated with your public key.

          Regardless of the DKIM authentication method  you  use,  Amazon  SES
          searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the
          domain for up to 72 hours.
