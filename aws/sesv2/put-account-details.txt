          o TRANSACTIONAL

          the type of content that you plan to send.

       --additional-contact-email-addresses (list)

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --production-access-enabled | --no-production-access-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates  whether or not your account should have production access
          in the current Amazon Web Services Region.

          If the value is false , then your account is in the sandbox  .  When
          your  account is in the sandbox, you can only send email to verified
          identities. Additionally, the maximum number of emails you can  send
          in  a  24-hour  period  (your sending quota) is 200, and the maximum
          number of emails you can send per second (your maximum sending rate)
          is 1.

          If the value is true , then your account has production access. When
          your account has production access, you can send email  to  any  ad-
          dress.  The  sending quota and maximum sending rate for your account
          vary based on your specific use case.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
