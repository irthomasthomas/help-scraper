NAME
       get-configuration-set-event-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a  list of event destinations that are associated with a con-
       figuration set.
          Events include message sends, deliveries,  opens,  clicks,  bounces,
          and  complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send in-
          formation about these events to. For example,  you  can  send  event
          data to Amazon EventBridge and associate a rule to send the event to
          the specified target.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set that contains the  event  destina-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       EventDestinations -> (list)
          An array that includes all of the events destinations that have been
          configured for the configuration set.

          (structure)
              In the Amazon SES API v2, events include message sends, deliver-
              ies,  opens,  clicks,  bounces,  complaints and delivery delays.
              Event destinations are places  that  you  can  send  information
              about  these  events to. For example, you can send event data to
              Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces  or
              complaints,  or  you  can  use  Amazon  Kinesis Data Firehose to
              stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name that identifies the event destination.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If true , the event destination is enabled.  When  the  event
                 destination is enabled, the specified event types are sent to
                 the destinations in this EventDestinationDefinition .

                 If false , the event destination is disabled. When the  event
                 destination  is disabled, events aren't sent to the specified
                 destinations.

              MatchingEventTypes -> (list)
                 The types of events that Amazon SES sends  to  the  specified
                 event destinations.

                 o SEND - The send request was successful and SES will attempt
                   to deliver the message to the recipients mail  server.  (If
                   account-level or global suppression is being used, SES will
                   still count it as a send, but delivery is suppressed.)

                 o REJECT - SES accepted the email,  but  determined  that  it
                   contained  a  virus  and didnt attempt to deliver it to the
                   recipients mail server.

                 o BOUNCE - (Hard bounce ) The recipient's mail server  perma-
                   nently  rejected the email. (Soft bounces are only included
                   when SES fails to deliver the email after  retrying  for  a
                   period of time.)

                 o COMPLAINT - The email was successfully delivered to the re-
                   cipients mail server, but the recipient marked it as spam.

                 o DELIVERY - SES successfully delivered the email to the  re-
                   cipient's mail server.

                 o OPEN  - The recipient received the message and opened it in
                   their email client.

                 o CLICK - The recipient clicked one  or  more  links  in  the
                   email.

                 o RENDERING_FAILURE - The email wasn't sent because of a tem-
                   plate rendering issue. This event type can occur when  tem-
                   plate  data is missing, or when there is a mismatch between
                   template parameters and data. (This event type only  occurs
                   when   you   send  email  using  the  `  SendTemplatedEmail
                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendTemplatedEmail.html`__
                   or                 `                 SendBulkTemplatedEmail
                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendBulkTemplatedEmail.html`__
                   API operations.)

                 o DELIVERY_DELAY - The email couldn't be delivered to the re-
                   cipients mail server because a  temporary  issue  occurred.
                   Delivery  delays  can  occur, for example, when the recipi-
                   ent's inbox is full, or when the receiving email server ex-
                   periences a transient issue.

                 o SUBSCRIPTION  -  The  email was successfully delivered, but
                   the recipient updated  their  subscription  preferences  by
                   clicking   on   an   unsubscribe   link  as  part  of  your
                   subscription management .

                 (string)
                     An email sending event type. For  example,  email  sends,
                     opens, and bounces are all email events.
