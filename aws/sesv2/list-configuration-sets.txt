LIST-CONFIGURATION-SETS()                            LIST-CONFIGURATION-SETS()



NAME
       list-configuration-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all of the configuration sets associated with your account in the
       current region.
          Configuration sets are groups of rules that you  can  apply  to  the
          emails  you  send.  You apply a configuration set to an email by in-
          cluding a reference to the configuration set in the headers  of  the
          email.  When  you  apply a configuration set to an email, all of the
          rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call  to  ListConfigurationSets  to
          indicate the position in the list of configuration sets.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  number  of  results  to show in a single call to ListConfigura-
          tionSets . If the number of results is larger than  the  number  you
          specified  in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken
          element, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationSets -> (list)

          SES account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.

          (string)

                 Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply  to
                 the  emails  you  send.  You  apply a configuration set to an
                 email by including a reference to the  configuration  set  in
                 the  headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set
                 to an email, all of the rules in that configuration  set  are
                 applied to the email.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token that indicates that there are additional configuration sets
          to list. To view additional configuration sets,  issue  another  re-
          quest  to ListConfigurationSets , and pass this token in the NextTo-
          ken parameter.
