OPTIONS
       --pool-name (string)
          The name of the IP pool that the dedicated IP address is  associated
          with.

       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call to GetDedicatedIps to indicate
          the position of the dedicated IP pool in the list of IP pools.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to GetDedicatedIpsRe-
          quest . If the number of results is larger than the number you spec-
          ified in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIps -> (list)
          A list of dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your  Ama-
          zon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about a dedicated IP address that is asso-
              ciated with your Amazon SES account.

              To learn more  about  requesting  dedicated  IP  addresses,  see
              Requesting  and Relinquishing Dedicated IP Addresses in the Ama-

                 have one of the following values:

                 o IN_PROGRESS   The IP address isn't ready to use because the
                   dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.

                 o DONE  The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the
                   IP address is ready to use.

              WarmupPercentage -> (integer)
                 Indicates  how  complete the dedicated IP warm-up process is.
                 When this value equals  1,  the  address  has  completed  the
                 warm-up process and is ready for use.

              PoolName -> (string)
                 The  name of the dedicated IP pool that the IP address is as-
                 sociated with.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that indicates that there are additional  dedicated  IP  ad-
          dresses to list. To view additional addresses, issue another request
          to GetDedicatedIps , passing this token in the NextToken parameter.
