OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous  call  to  ListCustomVerificationE-
          mailTemplates to indicate the position in the list of custom verifi-
          cation email templates.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to  ListCustomVerifi-
          cationEmailTemplates  .  If the number of results is larger than the
          number you specified in this parameter, then the response includes a
          NextToken element, which you can use to obtain additional results.

          The  value you specify has to be at least 1, and can be no more than
          50.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
