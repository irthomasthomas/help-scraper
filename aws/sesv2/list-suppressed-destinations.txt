OPTIONS
       --reasons (list)
          The factors that caused the email address to be added to .

          (string)
              The reason that the address was added to  the  suppression  list
              for your account. The value can be one of the following:

              o COMPLAINT   Amazon  SES added an email address to the suppres-
                sion list for your account because a message sent to that  ad-
                dress results in a complaint.

              o BOUNCE   Amazon  SES added an email address to the suppression
                list for your account because a message sent to  that  address
                results in a hard bounce.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            BOUNCE
            COMPLAINT

       --start-date (timestamp)
          Used  to filter the list of suppressed email destinations so that it
          only includes addresses that were added to the list after a specific
          date.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          Used  to filter the list of suppressed email destinations so that it
          only includes addresses that were added to the list  before  a  spe-
          cific date.

       --next-token (string)
          A  token returned from a previous call to ListSuppressedDestinations
          to indicate the position in the list of suppressed email addresses.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call to ListSuppressedDes-
          tinations  .  If the number of results is larger than the number you
          specified in this parameter, then the response includes a  NextToken
          element, which you can use to obtain additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
