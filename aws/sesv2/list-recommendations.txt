OPTIONS
       --filter (map)
          Filters applied when retrieving recommendations. Can eiter be an in-
          dividual  filter, or combinations of STATUS and IMPACT or STATUS and
          TYPE

          key -> (string)
              The ListRecommendations filter type. This can be one of the fol-
              lowing:

              o TYPE   The  recommendation type, with values like DKIM , SPF ,
                DMARC or BIMI .

              o IMPACT  The recommendation impact, with values  like  HIGH  or
                LOW .

              o STATUS   The  recommendation  status, with values like OPEN or
                FIXED .

              o RESOURCE_ARN  The resource  affected  by  the  recommendation,
                with   values   like  arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:iden-
                tity/example.com .

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          Where valid key names are:
            TYPE
            IMPACT
            STATUS
            RESOURCE_ARN

       JSON Syntax:

          {"TYPE"|"IMPACT"|"STATUS"|"RESOURCE_ARN": "string"
            ...}

       --next-token (string)
          A token returned from a previous call to ListRecommendations to  in-
          dicate the position in the list of recommendations.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  number  of  results to show in a single call to ListRecommenda-
          tions . If the number of results is larger than the number you spec-
          ified in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

          The value you specify has to be at least 1, and can be no more  than
          100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
