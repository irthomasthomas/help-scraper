OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A  token returned from a previous call to ListEmailIdentities to in-
          dicate the position in the list of identities.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of results to show in a single call  to  ListEmailIdenti-
          ties . If the number of results is larger than the number you speci-
          fied in this parameter, then the response includes a NextToken  ele-
          ment, which you can use to obtain additional results.

          The  value you specify has to be at least 0, and can be no more than
          1000.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       EmailIdentities -> (list)
          An  array  that includes all of the email identities associated with
          your Amazon Web Services account.

          (structure)
              Information about an email identity.

              IdentityType -> (string)
                 The email identity type. Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN type is not
                 supported for email identity types.

              IdentityName -> (string)
                 The address or domain of the identity.

              SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  or  not you can send email from the iden-
                 tity.

                 An identity is an email address or domain that you send email
                 from. Before you can send email from an identity, you have to
                 demostrate that you own the identity, and that you  authorize
                 Amazon SES to send email from that identity.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token that indicates that there are additional configuration sets
          to list. To view additional configuration sets,  issue  another  re-
          quest  to ListEmailIdentities , and pass this token in the NextToken
          parameter.
