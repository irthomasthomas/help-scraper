OPTIONS
       --ip (string)
          The  IP  address that you want to obtain more information about. The
          value you specify has to be a dedicated IP address that's assocaited
          with your Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       DedicatedIp -> (structure)
          An object that contains information about a dedicated IP address.

          Ip -> (string)
              An IPv4 address.

          WarmupStatus -> (string)
              The  warm-up  status  of  a dedicated IP address. The status can
              have one of the following values:

              o IN_PROGRESS  The IP address isn't ready  to  use  because  the
                dedicated IP warm-up process is ongoing.

              o DONE  The dedicated IP warm-up process is complete, and the IP
                address is ready to use.

          WarmupPercentage -> (integer)
              Indicates how complete the dedicated IP warm-up process is. When
              this  value  equals  1,  the  address  has completed the warm-up
              process and is ready for use.

          PoolName -> (string)
              The name of the dedicated IP pool that the IP address is associ-
              ated with.
