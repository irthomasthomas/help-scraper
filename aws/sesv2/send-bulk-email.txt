OPTIONS
       --from-email-address (string)
          The  email  address  to use as the "From" address for the email. The
          address that you specify has to be verified.

       --from-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the email address  specified  in  the
          FromEmailAddress parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com) attaches  a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use sender@example.com, then you
          would    specify    the    FromEmailAddressIdentityArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com,   and   the
          FromEmailAddress to be sender@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  "Reply-to"  email addresses for the message. When the recipient
          replies to the message, each Reply-to address receives the reply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address (string)
          The address that you want bounce and complaint notifications  to  be
          sent to.

       --feedback-forwarding-email-address-identity-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com)  attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use  feedback@example.com,  then
          you  would  specify the FeedbackForwardingEmailAddressIdentityArn to
          be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com, and  the
          FeedbackForwardingEmailAddress to be feedback@example.com.

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

          email  that  you send using the SendEmail operation. Tags correspond
          to characteristics of the email that you define,  so  that  you  can
          publish email sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that you apply to an email.

                   underscores (_), or dashes (-).

            ...
          ]

                 ables in the template. This object  is  a  set  of  key-value
                 pairs.  Each  key defines a message variable in the template.
                 The corresponding value defines the value  to  use  for  that
                 variable.

          (structure)
              Destination -> (structure)
                 Represents the destination of the message, consisting of To:,
                 CC:, and BCC: fields.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon  SES  does  not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as
                     described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of
                     a  destination  email  address (the part of the email ad-
                     dress that precedes the @ sign) may  only  contain  7-bit
                     ASCII  characters . If the domain part of an address (the
                     part after the @  sign)  contains  non-ASCII  characters,
                     they  must  be  encoded  using  Punycode, as described in
                     RFC3492 .

                     (carbon copy) recipients for the email.

                     (string)

                 BccAddresses -> (list)
                     An array that contains the email addresses of  the  "BCC"
                     (blind carbon copy) recipients for the email.

                 an email that you send using the SendBulkTemplatedEmail oper-
                 ation.  Tags  correspond to characteristics of the email that
                 you define, so that you can publish email sending events.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the name and value of a tag that you apply to an
                     email.  You  can  use message tags when you publish email

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the message tag. The message tag name  has
                        to meet the following criteria:

                        o It  can only contain ASCII letters (az, AZ), numbers
                          (09), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                        o It can contain no more than 256 characters.

                     Value -> (string)

                     ReplacementTemplateData -> (string)
                        A list of replacement values to apply to the template.
                        This  parameter is a JSON object, typically consisting
                        of key-value pairs in which the keys correspond to re-
                        placement tags in the email template.

              ReplacementHeaders -> (list)
                 The  list of message headers associated with the BulkEmailEn-
                 try data type.

                 o Headers Present in BulkEmailEntry : If a header  is  speci-
                   fied  in  BulkEmailEntry  ,  it  takes  precedence over any
                   header  of  the  same  name   specified   in   `   Template
                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_Template.html`__
                   :

                   o If the header is also defined within Template , the value
                     from  BulkEmailEntry  will  replace the header's value in
                     the email.

                   o If the header is not defined within Template  ,  it  will
                     simply be added to the email as specified in BulkEmailEn-
                     try .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
