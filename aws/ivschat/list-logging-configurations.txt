DESCRIPTION

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of logging configurations to return. Default: 50.

       --next-token (string)
          The first logging configurations to retrieve. This is used for pagi-
          nation; see the nextToken response field.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  get  summary  information  about all logging configurations for the
       user in the AWS region where the API request is processed

       The following  list-logging-configurations  example  lists  information
       about all LoggingConfiguration resources for the user in the AWS region
       where the API request is processed.

          aws ivschat list-logging-configurations \
              --max-results 2 \
              --next-token ""

OUTPUT
       loggingConfigurations -> (list)
          List  of  the  matching  logging configurations (summary information
          only). There is only one type of destination (cloudWatchLogs , fire-
          hose , or s3 ) in a destinationConfiguration .

              Summary information about a logging configuration.

              arn -> (string)
                 Logging-configuration ARN.

              createTime -> (timestamp)

                 where chat content will be logged.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: cloudWatchLogs,  firehose,
                     s3.

                 cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
                     An Amazon CloudWatch Logs destination configuration where

                     An  Amazon S3 destination configuration where chat activ-
                     ity will be logged.

                     bucketName -> (string)
                        Name of the Amazon S3 bucket where chat activity  will

                 Tags  to  attach  to the resource. Array of maps, each of the
                 form string:string (key:value) . See  Tagging  AWS  Resources
                 for  details,  including  restrictions that apply to tags and
                 "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has  no
