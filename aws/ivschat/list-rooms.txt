NAME
       list-rooms -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  summary  information about all your rooms in the AWS region where
       the API request is processed. Results are sorted in descending order of
       updateTime .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-rooms
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--message-review-handler-uri <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of rooms to return. Default: 50.

       --message-review-handler-uri (string)
          Filters the list to match the specified message review handler URI.

       --name (string)
          Filters the list to match the specified room name.

       --next-token (string)
          The  first  room  to  retrieve. This is used for pagination; see the
          nextToken response field.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get summary information about all your rooms in the current region

       The following list-rooms example gets summary information about all the
       rooms in the AWS region where the request  is  processed.  Results  are
       sorted in descending order of updateTime.

          aws ivschat list-rooms \
              --max-results 10 \
              --next-token page2

       Output:

          {
              "nextToken": "page3",
              "rooms": [
                  {
                      "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
                      "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
                      "id": "12345689012",
                      "name": "test-room-1",
                      "tags": {},
                      "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are more rooms than maxResults , use nextToken in  the  re-
          quest to get the next set.

       rooms -> (list)
          List of the matching rooms (summary information only).

          (structure)
              Summary information about a room.

              arn -> (string)
                 Room ARN.

              createTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  when  the  room  was created. This is an ISO 8601 time-
                 stamp; note that this is returned as a string .

              id -> (string)
                 Room ID, generated by the system. This is a relative  identi-
                 fier, the part of the ARN that uniquely identifies the room.

              messageReviewHandler -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for optional review of messages.

                 fallbackResult -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  fallback behavior (whether the message is
                     allowed or denied) if the handler does not return a valid
                     response,  encounters  an  error,  or times out. (For the
                     timeout period, see Service Quotas  .)  If  allowed,  the
                     message  is  delivered with returned content to all users
                     connected to the room. If denied, the message is not  de-
                     livered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

                 uri -> (string)
                     Identifier  of the message review handler. Currently this
                     must be an ARN of a lambda function.

              name -> (string)
                 Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags attached to the resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              updateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time of the rooms last update. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
                 note that this is returned as a string .
