OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of rooms to return. Default: 50.

       --message-review-handler-uri (string)
          Filters the list to match the specified message review handler URI.

       --name (string)
          Filters the list to match the specified room name.

       --next-token (string)
          The  first  room  to  retrieve. This is used for pagination; see the
          nextToken response field.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get summary information about all your rooms in the current region

       The following list-rooms example gets summary information about all the
       rooms  in  the  AWS  region where the request is processed. Results are
       sorted in descending order of updateTime.

          aws ivschat list-rooms \
              --max-results 10 \
              --next-token page2

       Output:

          {
              "nextToken": "page3",
              "rooms": [
                  {
                      "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
                      "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
                      "id": "12345689012",
                      "name": "test-room-1",
                      "tags": {},
                      "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          If  there  are more rooms than maxResults , use nextToken in the re-
          quest to get the next set.

       rooms -> (list)
          List of the matching rooms (summary information only).

          (structure)
              Summary information about a room.

              arn -> (string)
                 Room ARN.

              createTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time when the room was created. This is  an  ISO  8601  time-
                 stamp; note that this is returned as a string .

              id -> (string)
                 Room  ID, generated by the system. This is a relative identi-
                 fier, the part of the ARN that uniquely identifies the room.

              messageReviewHandler -> (structure)
                 Configuration information for optional review of messages.

                 fallbackResult -> (string)
                     Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the  message  is
                     allowed or denied) if the handler does not return a valid
                     response, encounters an error, or  times  out.  (For  the
                     timeout  period,  see  Service  Quotas .) If allowed, the
                     message is delivered with returned content to  all  users
                     connected  to the room. If denied, the message is not de-
                     livered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

                 uri -> (string)
                     Identifier of the message review handler. Currently  this
                     must be an ARN of a lambda function.

              name -> (string)
                 Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

              tags -> (map)
                 Tags  attached to the resource. See Tagging AWS Resources for
                 details, including restrictions that apply to tags  and  "Tag
                 naming  limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no con-
                 straints beyond what is documented there.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              updateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time of the rooms last update. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
                 note that this is returned as a string .
