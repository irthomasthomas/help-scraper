OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          Identifier of the logging configuration to be updated.

       --name (string)
          Logging-configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --destination-configuration (tagged union structure)
          A  complex  type that contains a destination configuration for where
          chat content will be logged. There can be only one type of  destina-
          tion (cloudWatchLogs , firehose , or s3 ) in a destinationConfigura-
          tion .

          NOTE:
              This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following  top
              level keys can be set: s3, cloudWatchLogs, firehose.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An  Amazon S3 destination configuration where chat activity will
              be logged.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the Amazon S3 bucket  where  chat  activity  will  be
                 logged.

          cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
              An  Amazon  CloudWatch Logs destination configuration where chat
              activity will be logged.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 Name of the Amazon Cloudwatch Logs destination where chat ac-
                 tivity will be logged.

          firehose -> (structure)
              An  Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose destination configuration where
              chat activity will be logged.

              deliveryStreamName -> (string)
                 Name of the Amazon Kinesis  Firehose  delivery  stream  where
                 chat activity will be logged.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string},cloudWatchLogs={logGroupName=string},firehose={deliveryStreamName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string"
            },
            "cloudWatchLogs": {
              "logGroupName": "string"
            },
            "firehose": {
              "deliveryStreamName": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              --destination-configuration s3={bucketName=demo-logging-bucket} \
