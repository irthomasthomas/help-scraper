GET-ROOM()                                                          GET-ROOM()



NAME
       get-room -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the specified room.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-room
          --identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          Identifier  of  the  room  for  which the configuration is to be re-
          trieved. Currently this must be an ARN.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the specified room

       The following get-room example gets  information  about  the  specified
       room.

          aws ivschat get-room \
              --identifier "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6"

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
              "id": "12345689012",
              "maximumMessageLength": 256,
              "maximumMessageRatePerSecond": 5,
              "name": "test-room-1",
              "tags": {},
              "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
          }

       Amazon Interactive Video Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       arn -> (string)
          Room ARN, from the request (if identifier was an ARN).

       createTime -> (timestamp)
          Time when the room was created. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;  note
          that this is returned as a string .

       id -> (string)
          Room ID, generated by the system. This is a relative identifier, the
          part of the ARN that uniquely identifies the room.

       maximumMessageLength -> (integer)
          Maximum number of characters in a single message. Messages  are  ex-
          pected  to  be  UTF-8 encoded and this limit applies specifically to
          rune/code-point count, not number of bytes. Default: 500.

       maximumMessageRatePerSecond -> (integer)
          Maximum number of messages per second that can be sent to  the  room
          (by all clients). Default: 10.

       messageReviewHandler -> (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of messages.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies  the fallback behavior (whether the message is allowed
              or denied) if the handler does not return a valid response,  en-
              counters  an  error,  or times out. (For the timeout period, see
              Service Quotas .) If allowed, the message is delivered with  re-
              turned  content  to  all users connected to the room. If denied,
              the message is not delivered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

       name -> (string)
          Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

       tags -> (map)
          Tags  attached  to  the  resource.  Array  of maps, each of the form
          string:string (key:value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       updateTime -> (timestamp)
          Time of the rooms last update. This is an ISO 8601  timestamp;  note
          that this is returned as a string .
