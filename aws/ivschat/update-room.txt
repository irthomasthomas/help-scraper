SYNOPSIS
            update-room
          --identifier <value>
          [--maximum-message-length <value>]
          [--maximum-message-rate-per-second <value>]
          [--message-review-handler <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          Identifier of the room to be updated. Currently this must be an ARN.

       --maximum-message-length (integer)
          The  maximum  number of characters in a single message. Messages are
          expected to be UTF-8 encoded and this limit applies specifically  to
          rune/code-point count, not number of bytes. Default: 500.

       --maximum-message-rate-per-second (integer)
          The  maximum number of messages per second that a client can send to
          the room. Default: 10.

       --message-review-handler (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of  messages.  Specify
          an  empty  uri  string to disassociate a message review handler from
          the specified room.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is  allowed
              or  denied) if the handler does not return a valid response, en-
              counters an error or times out. If allowed, the message  is  de-
              livered  with  returned  content  to  all users connected to the
              room. If denied, the message is not delivered to any  user.  De-
              fault: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fallbackResult=string,uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fallbackResult": "ALLOW"|"DENY",
            "uri": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          room, from the request.

       messageReviewHandler -> (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of messages.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is  allowed

              fault: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
