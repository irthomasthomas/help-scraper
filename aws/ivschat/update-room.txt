DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-room
          --identifier <value>
          [--maximum-message-length <value>]
          [--maximum-message-rate-per-second <value>]
          [--message-review-handler <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          Identifier of the room to be updated. Currently this must be an ARN.

       --maximum-message-length (integer)
          The  maximum  number of characters in a single message. Messages are
          expected to be UTF-8 encoded and this limit applies specifically  to
          rune/code-point count, not number of bytes. Default: 500.

       --maximum-message-rate-per-second (integer)
          Maximum  number  of messages per second that can be sent to the room
          (by all clients). Default: 10.

       --message-review-handler (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of  messages.  Specify
          an  empty  uri  string to disassociate a message review handler from
          the specified room.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is  allowed
              or  denied) if the handler does not return a valid response, en-
              counters an error, or times out. (For the  timeout  period,  see
              Service  Quotas .) If allowed, the message is delivered with re-
              turned content to all users connected to the  room.  If  denied,
              the message is not delivered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fallbackResult=string,uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fallbackResult": "ALLOW"|"DENY",
            "uri": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a room's configuration

       The following update-room example updates the specified room's configu-
       ration with the given data.

          aws ivschat update-room \
              --identifier "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6" \
              --name "chat-room-a" \
              --maximumMessageLength 256 \
              --maximumMessageRatePerSecond 5

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
              "id": "12345689012",
              "maximumMessageLength": 256,
              "maximumMessageRatePerSecond": 5,
              "name": "test-room-1",
              "tags": {},
              "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
          }
