       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-room
          [--maximum-message-length <value>]
          [--maximum-message-rate-per-second <value>]
          [--message-review-handler <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --maximum-message-length (integer)
          Maximum  number  of characters in a single message. Messages are ex-
          pected to be UTF-8 encoded and this limit  applies  specifically  to
          rune/code-point count, not number of bytes. Default: 500.

       --maximum-message-rate-per-second (integer)
          Maximum  number  of messages per second that can be sent to the room
          (by all clients). Default: 10.

       --message-review-handler (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of messages.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is  allowed
              or  denied) if the handler does not return a valid response, en-
              counters an error, or times out. (For the  timeout  period,  see
              Service  Quotas .) If allowed, the message is delivered with re-
              turned content to all users connected to the  room.  If  denied,
              the message is not delivered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fallbackResult=string,uri=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "fallbackResult": "ALLOW"|"DENY",
            "uri": "string"
          }

       --name (string)
          Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --tags (map)
          Tags to attach to the resource. Array of  maps,  each  of  the  form
          string:string (key:value) .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a room

       The following create-room example creates a new room.

          aws ivschat create-room \
              --name "test-room-1" \
              --maximumMessageLength 256 \
              --maximumMessageRatePerSecond 5

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "id": "g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
              "maximumMessageLength": 256,
              "maximumMessageRatePerSecond": 5,
              "name": "test-room-1",
              "tags": {}
              "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
          }

          that this is returned as a string .

       id -> (string)
          Room ID, generated by the system. This is a relative identifier, the
          part of the ARN that uniquely identifies the room.

       maximumMessageLength -> (integer)
          Maximum number of characters in a single message, from the request.

       maximumMessageRatePerSecond -> (integer)
          Maximum  number  of messages per second that can be sent to the room
          (by all clients), from the request.

       messageReviewHandler -> (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of messages.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is  allowed
              or  denied) if the handler does not return a valid response, en-
              counters an error, or times out. (For the  timeout  period,  see
              Service  Quotas .) If allowed, the message is delivered with re-
              turned content to all users connected to the  room.  If  denied,
              the message is not delivered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

       name -> (string)
          Room name, from the request (if specified).

       tags -> (map)
          Tags attached to the resource, from the request.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       updateTime -> (timestamp)
          Time of the rooms last update. This is an ISO 8601  timestamp;  note
