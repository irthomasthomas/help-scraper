OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Room name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --maximum-message-rate-per-second (integer)
          Maximum  number  of messages per second that can be sent to the room
          (by all clients). Default: 10.

       --maximum-message-length (integer)
          Maximum number of characters in a single message. Messages  are  ex-
          pected  to  be  UTF-8 encoded and this limit applies specifically to
          rune/code-point count, not number of bytes. Default: 500.

       --message-review-handler (structure)
          Configuration information for optional review of messages.

          uri -> (string)
              Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be
              an ARN of a lambda function.

          fallbackResult -> (string)
              Specifies  the fallback behavior (whether the message is allowed
              or denied) if the handler does not return a valid response,  en-
              counters  an  error,  or times out. (For the timeout period, see
              Service Quotas .) If allowed, the message is delivered with  re-
              turned  content  to  all users connected to the room. If denied,
              the message is not delivered to any user. Default: ALLOW .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          uri=string,fallbackResult=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "uri": "string",
            "fallbackResult": "ALLOW"|"DENY"
          }

       --tags (map)
          Tags to attach to the resource. Array of  maps,  each  of  the  form
          string:string  (key:value)  .  See  Best practices and strategies in
          Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag  Editor  for  details,
          including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
          requirements"; Amazon IVS Chat has no  constraints  beyond  what  is
          documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --logging-configuration-identifiers (list)
          Array of logging-configuration identifiers attached to the room.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a room

       The following create-room example creates a new room.

          aws ivschat create-room \
              --name "test-room-1" \
              --logging-configuration-identifiers "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:123456789012:logging-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ" \
              --maximum-message-length 256 \
              --maximum-message-rate-per-second 5

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:12345689012:room/g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "id": "g1H2I3j4k5L6",
              "createTime": "2022-03-16T04:44:09+00:00",
              "loggingConfigurationIdentifiers": ["arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:123456789012:logging-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ"],
              "maximumMessageLength": 256,
              "maximumMessageRatePerSecond": 5,
              "name": "test-room-1",
              "tags": {}
              "updateTime": "2022-03-16T07:22:09+00:00"
          }
