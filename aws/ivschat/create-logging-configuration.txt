OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Logging-configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.

       --destination-configuration (tagged union structure)
          A complex type that contains a destination configuration  for  where
          chat  content will be logged. There can be only one type of destina-
          tion (cloudWatchLogs , firehose , or s3 ) in a destinationConfigura-
          tion .

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: s3, cloudWatchLogs, firehose.

          s3 -> (structure)
              An Amazon S3 destination configuration where chat activity  will
              be logged.

              bucketName -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  Amazon  S3  bucket where chat activity will be
                 logged.

          cloudWatchLogs -> (structure)
              An Amazon CloudWatch Logs destination configuration  where  chat
              activity will be logged.

              logGroupName -> (string)
                 Name of the Amazon Cloudwatch Logs destination where chat ac-
                 tivity will be logged.

          firehose -> (structure)
              An Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose destination configuration  where
              chat activity will be logged.

              deliveryStreamName -> (string)
                 Name  of  the  Amazon  Kinesis Firehose delivery stream where
                 chat activity will be logged.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          s3={bucketName=string},cloudWatchLogs={logGroupName=string},firehose={deliveryStreamName=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "s3": {
              "bucketName": "string"
            },
            "cloudWatchLogs": {
              "logGroupName": "string"
            },
            "firehose": {
              "deliveryStreamName": "string"
            }
          }

       --tags (map)
          Tags to attach to the resource. Array of  maps,  each  of  the  form
          string:string  (key:value)  . See Tagging AWS Resources for details,
          including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
          requirements";  Amazon  IVS  Chat  has no constraints on tags beyond
          what is documented there.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a chat LoggingConfiguration resource

       The following create-logging-configuration example creates  a  Logging-
       Configuration  resource  that  allows  clients to store and record sent
       messages.

          aws ivschat create-logging-configuration \
              --destination-configuration s3={bucketName=demo-logging-bucket} \
              --name "test-logging-config" \
              --tags "key1=value1, key2=value2"

       Output:

          {
              "arn": "arn:aws:ivschat:us-west-2:123456789012:logging-configuration/ABcdef34ghIJ",
              "createTime": "2022-09-14T17:48:00.653000+00:00",
              "destinationConfiguration": {
                  "s3": {
                      "bucketName": "demo-logging-bucket"
                  }
              },
              "id": "ABcdef34ghIJ",
              "name": "test-logging-config",
              "state": "ACTIVE",
              "tags": { "key1" : "value1", "key2" : "value2" },
              "updateTime": "2022-09-14T17:48:01.104000+00:00"
