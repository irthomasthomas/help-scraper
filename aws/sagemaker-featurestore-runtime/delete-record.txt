DELETE-RECORD()                                                DELETE-RECORD()



NAME
       delete-record -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a Record from a FeatureGroup in the OnlineStore . Feature Store
       supports both SoftDelete and HardDelete  .  For  SoftDelete  (default),
       feature columns are set to null and the record is no longer retrievable
       by GetRecord or BatchGetRecord . For HardDelete , the  complete  Record
       is  removed from the OnlineStore . In both cases, Feature Store appends
       the deleted record marker to the  OfflineStore  .  The  deleted  record
       marker  is  a record with the same RecordIdentifer as the original, but
       with is_deleted value set to True , EventTime set to the  delete  input
       EventTime , and other feature values set to null .

       Note  that  the EventTime specified in DeleteRecord should be set later
       than the EventTime of the existing record in the OnlineStore  for  that
       RecordIdentifer . If it is not, the deletion does not occur:

       o For SoftDelete , the existing (not deleted) record remains in the On-
         lineStore , though the delete record marker is still written  to  the
         OfflineStore .

       o HardDelete  returns  EventTime  : 400 ValidationException to indicate
         that the delete operation failed. No delete record marker is  written
         to the OfflineStore .

       When  a  record  is  deleted  from the OnlineStore , the deleted record
       marker is appended to the OfflineStore . If you have the Iceberg  table
       format  enabled for your OfflineStore , you can remove all history of a
       record from the OfflineStore using Amazon Athena or Apache  Spark.  For
       information  on  how to hard delete a record from the OfflineStore with
       the Iceberg table format enabled, see Delete records from  the  offline
       store .

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the feature group to
          delete the record from.

       --record-identifier-value-as-string (string)
          The value for the  RecordIdentifier  that  uniquely  identifies  the
          record, in string format.

       --event-time (string)
          Timestamp indicating when the deletion event occurred. EventTime can
          be used to query data at a certain point in time.

       --target-stores (list)
          A list of stores from which you're deleting the record. By  default,
          Feature  Store deletes the record from all of the stores that you're
          using for the FeatureGroup .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            OnlineStore
            OfflineStore

       --deletion-mode (string)
          The name of the deletion mode for deleting the record.  By  default,
          the deletion mode is set to SoftDelete .

          Possible values:

          o SoftDelete

          o HardDelete

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.
