DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()                  DISCONNECT-RECOVERY-INSTANCE()



NAME
       disconnect-recovery-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Disconnect  a  Recovery  Instance  from Elastic Disaster Recovery. Data
       replication is stopped immediately. All AWS resources created by  Elas-
       tic  Disaster Recovery for enabling the replication of the Recovery In-
       stance will be terminated / deleted within 90 minutes. If the agent  on
       the  Recovery  Instance  has not been prevented from communicating with
       the Elastic Disaster Recovery service, then it will receive  a  command
       to  uninstall  itself  (within approximately 10 minutes). The following
       properties of  the  Recovery  Instance  will  be  changed  immediately:
       dataReplicationInfo.dataReplicationState  will  be set to DISCONNECTED;
       The totalStorageBytes property for each  of  dataReplicationInfo.repli-
       catedDisks  will  be  set  to zero; dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration and
       dataReplicationInfo.lagDuration will be nullified.

OPTIONS
       --recovery-instance-id (string)
          The ID of the Recovery Instance to disconnect.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.
