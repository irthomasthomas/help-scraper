RETRY-DATA-REPLICATION()                              RETRY-DATA-REPLICATION()



NAME
       retry-data-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Causes  the  data  replication initiation sequence to begin immediately
       upon next Handshake for the specified Source Server ID,  regardless  of
       when  the  previous  initiation started. This command will work only if
       the Source Server is stalled or is in a DISCONNECTED or STOPPED state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            retry-data-replication
          --source-server-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-server-id (string)
          The ID of the Source Server whose data  replication  should  be  re-
          tried.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
