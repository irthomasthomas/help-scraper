NAME
       describe-connector-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of connector-profile details matching the provided con-
       nector-profile names and connector-types . Both  input  lists  are  op-
       tional, and you can use them to filter the result.

       If no names or connector-types are provided, returns all connector pro-
       files in a paginated form. If there is no match, this operation returns
       an empty list.

       --connector-label (string)
          The name of the connector. The name is unique for each ConnectorReg-
          istration  in your Amazon Web Services account. Only needed if call-
          ing for CUSTOMCONNECTOR connector type/.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the
          result  set. The default for maxResults is 20 (for all paginated API
          operations).

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

                        rization  calls  to  Salesforce.  Amazon AppFlow sends
                        private calls through Amazon Web Services PrivateLink.

                        Amazon  AppFlow sends all calls to Salesforce over the
                        private network.

                        These private calls are:

                        o Calls to get metadata about your Salesforce records.
                          This  metadata describes your Salesforce objects and
                          their fields.

                        o Calls to get or refresh  access  tokens  that  allow
                          Amazon AppFlow to access your Salesforce records.

                        o Calls to transfer your Salesforce records as part of
                          a flow run.

                          false

                        The default value. Amazon AppFlow sends some calls  to
                        Salesforce  privately  and other calls over the public
                        internet.

                        The public calls are:

                        o Calls to get metadata about your Salesforce records.

                        o Calls to get or refresh access tokens.

                        The private calls are:

                        o Calls to transfer your Salesforce records as part of
                          a flow run.

                            The authorization code url required to redirect to
                            SAP Login Page to  fetch  authorization  code  for
                            OAuth type authentication.

                        oAuthScopes -> (list)
                            The OAuth scopes required for OAuth type authenti-
                            cation.

                            (string)

                     disableSSO -> (boolean)
                        If you set this parameter to true , Amazon AppFlow by-
                        passes  the  single sign-on (SSO) settings in your SAP
                        account when it accesses your SAP OData instance.

                        Whether you need this option depends on the  types  of
                        credentials that you applied to your SAP OData connec-
                        tion profile. If your profile uses  basic  authentica-
                        tion  credentials,  SAP SSO can prevent Amazon AppFlow
                        from connecting to your account with your username and
                        password.  In this case, bypassing SSO makes it possi-
                        ble for Amazon AppFlow to connect  successfully.  How-
                        ever, if your profile uses OAuth credentials, this pa-
                        rameter has no affect.
