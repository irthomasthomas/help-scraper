OPTIONS
       --flow-name (string)
          The  specified  name of the flow. Spaces are not allowed. Use under-
          scores (_) or hyphens (-) only.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the maximum number of items that should be returned in the
          result  set. The default for maxResults is 20 (for all paginated API
          operations).

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                            GLUE

                        The metadata catalog is provided by the Glue Data Cat-
                        alog. Glue includes the Glue Data Catalog as a  compo-
                        nent.

                     tableName -> (string)
                        The name of the table that stores the metadata for the
                        associated flow run. The table  stores  metadata  that
                        represents  the data that the flow transferred. Amazon
                        AppFlow stores the table in the metadata catalog.

                     tableRegistrationOutput -> (structure)
                        Describes  the  status  of  the  attempt  from  Amazon
                        AppFlow  to register the metadata table with the meta-
                        data catalog. Amazon AppFlow creates or  updates  this

                            from Amazon AppFlow. If  the  attempt  fails,  the
                            message explains why.

                        result -> (string)
                            Indicates  the  number  of  resources  that Amazon
                            AppFlow created or updated. Possible resources in-
                            clude metadata tables and data partitions.

                        status -> (string)
                            Indicates  the  status of the registration attempt

                        AppFlow to register the data partitions with the meta-
                        data catalog. The data partitions  organize  the  flow
                        output into a hierarchical path, such as a folder path
                        in an S3 bucket. Amazon AppFlow creates the partitions
                        (if  they don't already exist) based on your flow con-
                        figuration.

                        message -> (string)

                            from Amazon AppFlow.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.
