          query the downstream connector.

          The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on.

          Possible values:

       --entities-path (string)
          This  optional  parameter  is  specific to connector implementation.
          Some connectors support multiple levels or categories  of  entities.
          You  can  find out the list of roots for such providers by sending a
          request without the entitiesPath parameter. If  the  connector  sup-
          ports  entities at different roots, this initial request returns the
          list of roots. Otherwise, this request  returns  all  entities  sup-
          ported by the provider.

       --api-version (string)
          The version of the API that's used by the connector.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of items that the operation returns in the re-
          sponse.

       --next-token (string)
          A token that was provided by your prior ListConnectorEntities opera-
          tion if the response was too big for the page size. You specify this
          token to get the next page of results in paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       connectorEntityMap -> (map)
          The response of ListConnectorEntities lists entities grouped by cat-
          egory.  This map's key represents the group name, and its value con-
          tains the list of entities belonging to that group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 The high-level entity that can be queried in Amazon  AppFlow.
                 For  example,  a Salesforce entity might be an Account or Op-
                 portunity , whereas a ServiceNow entity might be an  Incident
                 .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the connector entity.

                 label -> (string)
                     The label applied to the connector entity.

                 hasNestedEntities -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the connector entity is a parent or a
                     category and has more entities nested underneath  it.  If
                     another call is made with entitiesPath = "the_current_en-
                     tity_name_with_hasNestedEntities_true" , then it  returns
                     the nested entities underneath it. This provides a way to
                     retrieve all supported entities in a recursive fashion.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that you specify in your next  ListConnectorEntities  opera-
          tion  to  get  the  next  page of results in paginated response. The
          ListConnectorEntities operation provides this token if the  response
          is too big for the page size.
