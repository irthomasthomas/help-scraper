START-FLOW()                                                      START-FLOW()



NAME
       start-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Activates  an  existing  flow. For on-demand flows, this operation runs
       the flow immediately. For schedule and event-triggered flows, this  op-
       eration activates the flow.

OPTIONS
       --flow-name (string)
          The  specified  name of the flow. Spaces are not allowed. Use under-
          scores (_) or hyphens (-) only.

       --client-token (string)
          The clientToken parameter is an idempotency token. It  ensures  that
          your  StartFlow request completes only once. You choose the value to
          pass. For example, if you don't receive a  response  from  your  re-
          quest,  you  can  safely retry the request with the same clientToken
          parameter value.

          If you omit a clientToken value, the Amazon Web  Services  SDK  that
          you  are using inserts a value for you. This way, the SDK can safely
          retry requests multiple times after a network error. You  must  pro-
          vide your own value for other use cases.

          If you specify input parameters that differ from your first request,
          an error occurs for flows that run on a  schedule  or  based  on  an
          event.  However,  the  error doesn't occur for flows that run on de-
          mand. You set the conditions that initiate your flow for  the  trig-
          gerConfig parameter.

          If  you  use a different value for clientToken , Amazon AppFlow con-
          siders it a new call to StartFlow . The token is active for 8 hours.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       flowArn -> (string)
          The flow's Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       flowStatus -> (string)
          Indicates the current status of the flow.

       executionId -> (string)
          Returns the internal execution ID of an on-demand flow when the flow
          is  started.  For  scheduled or event-triggered flows, this value is
          null.
