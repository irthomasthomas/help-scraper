OPTIONS
       --flow-name (string)
          The  specified  name of the flow. Spaces are not allowed. Use under-
          scores (_) or hyphens (-) only.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

                              when it writes to Amazon S3. For example, an in-
                              teger or 1 in your source data is still an inte-
                              ger in your output.

                              source  data  becomes the string "1" in the out-
                              put.

                        For  example,  this  setting  would determine where to
                        write the response from a destination connector upon a
                        successful insert operation.

                        bucketPrefix -> (string)

                     errorHandlingConfig -> (structure)
                        The settings that determine how Amazon AppFlow handles
                        an error when placing data in the destination. For ex-
                        ample, this setting would determine if the flow should
                        fail  after  one  insertion error, or continue and at-
                        tempt to insert every record regardless of the initial
                        failure. ErrorHandlingConfig is a part of the destina-
                        tion connector details.

                        nector. When this value is not provided, this defaults

          triggerProperties -> (structure)
              Specifies the configuration details of a schedule-triggered flow
              as defined by the user. Currently, these settings only apply  to

                     The  time  at  which the scheduled flow ends. The time is
                     formatted as a timestamp that follows the ISO 8601  stan-
                     dard, such as 2022-04-27T13:00:00-07:00 .

                     affect how Amazon AppFlow interprets the timestamps  that
                     you specify to schedule the flow.

                     If  you  want to schedule a flow by using times in a par-
                     ticular time zone, indicate the time zone as a UTC offset
                     in  your timestamps. For example, the UTC offsets for the
                     America/New_York timezone are -04:00 EDT and -05:00 EST .

                 scheduleOffset -> (long)
                     Specifies the optional offset that is added to  the  time
                     interval for a schedule-triggered flow.

                 firstExecutionFrom -> (timestamp)
                     Specifies  the  date range for the records to import from
                     the connector in the first flow run.

                     Defines how many times a scheduled  flow  fails  consecu-
