OPTIONS
       --flow-name (string)
          The  specified  name of the flow. Spaces are not allowed. Use under-
          scores (_) or hyphens (-) only.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                 dataTransferApi -> (string)
                     Specifies which Salesforce API is used by Amazon  AppFlow
                     when your flow transfers data from Salesforce.
                        AUTOMATIC

                     The  default.  Amazon  AppFlow  selects  which API to use
                     based on the number of records that your  flow  transfers
                     from  Salesforce.  If  your  flow  transfers  fewer  than
                     1,000,000 records, Amazon AppFlow  uses  Salesforce  REST
                     API.  If  your  flow transfers 1,000,000 records or more,
                     Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0.

                     Each of these Salesforce  APIs  structures  data  differ-
                     ently.  If  Amazon AppFlow selects the API automatically,
                     be aware that, for recurring flows, the data output might
                     vary  from  one  flow  run to the next. For example, if a
                     flow runs daily, it might use REST  API  on  one  day  to
                     transfer  900,000  records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0
                     on the next day to transfer 1,100,000 records.  For  each
                     of these flow runs, the respective Salesforce API formats
                     the data differently. Some of the differences include how
                     dates  are  formatted  and  null  values are represented.
                     Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer  Salesforce  compound
                     fields.

                     By  choosing  this  option, you optimize flow performance
                     for both small and large data transfers, but the tradeoff
                     is inconsistent formatting in the output.
                        BULKV2

                     Amazon  AppFlow  uses  only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This
                     API runs asynchronous data transfers,  and  it's  optimal
                     for  large sets of data. By choosing this option, you en-
                     sure that your flow writes consistent output, but you op-
                     timize performance only for large data transfers.

                     Note  that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce com-
                     pound fields.
                        REST_SYNC

                     Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing
                     this  option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent
                     output, but  you  decrease  performance  for  large  data
                     transfers  that  are  better  suited for Bulk API 2.0. In
                     some cases, if your flow  attempts  to  transfer  a  vary
                     large set of data, it might fail wituh a timed out error.

                        The  Amazon  S3  bucket  name  in which Amazon AppFlow
                        places the transferred data.

                     bucketPrefix -> (string)
                        The object key for the  destination  bucket  in  which
                        Amazon AppFlow places the files.

                     s3OutputFormatConfig -> (structure)
                        The  configuration  that determines how Amazon AppFlow
                        should format the flow output data when Amazon  S3  is
                        used as the destination.

                        fileType -> (string)
                            Indicates the file type that Amazon AppFlow places
                            in the Amazon S3 bucket.

                        prefixConfig -> (structure)
                            Determines the prefix that Amazon AppFlow  applies
                            to  the  folder  name in the Amazon S3 bucket. You
                            can name folders according to the  flow  frequency
                            and date.

                            prefixType -> (string)
                               Determines   the  format  of  the  prefix,  and
                               whether it applies to the file name, file path,
                               or both.

                            prefixFormat -> (string)
                               Determines  the  level  of  granularity for the
                               date and time that's included in the prefix.

                            pathPrefixHierarchy -> (list)
                               Specifies whether the destination file path in-
                               cludes  either  or  both  of the following ele-
                               ments:
                                   EXECUTION_ID

                               The ID that Amazon AppFlow assigns to the  flow
                               run.
                                   SCHEMA_VERSION

                               The  version number of your data schema. Amazon
                               AppFlow assigns this version number.  The  ver-
                               sion  number  increases  by one when you change
                               any of the following settings in your flow con-
                               figuration:

                               o Source-to-destination field mappings

                               o Field data types

                               o Partition keys

                               (string)

                        aggregationConfig -> (structure)
                            The  aggregation settings that you can use to cus-
                            tomize the output format of your flow data.

                            aggregationType -> (string)
                               Specifies whether Amazon AppFlow aggregates the
                               flow  records into a single file, or leave them
                               unaggregated.

                            targetFileSize -> (long)
                               The desired file size, in MB, for  each  output
                               file  that  Amazon  AppFlow  writes to the flow
                               destination. For each file, Amazon AppFlow  at-
                               tempts  to  achieve  the size that you specify.
                               The actual file sizes might  differ  from  this
                               target  based  on  the  number  and size of the
                               records that each file contains.

                        preserveSourceDataTyping -> (boolean)
                            If your file output format is  Parquet,  use  this
                            parameter  to set whether Amazon AppFlow preserves
                            the data types in your source data when it  writes
                            the output to Amazon S3.

                            o true  :  Amazon AppFlow preserves the data types
                              when it writes to Amazon S3. For example, an in-
                              teger or 1 in your source data is still an inte-
                              ger in your output.

                            o false :  Amazon  AppFlow  converts  all  of  the
                              source  data into strings when it writes to Ama-
                              zon S3. For example, an integer  of  1  in  your
                              source  data  becomes the string "1" in the out-
                              put.

                 Salesforce -> (structure)
                     The properties required to query Salesforce.

                     object -> (string)
                        The object specified in the Salesforce  flow  destina-
                        tion.

                     idFieldNames -> (list)
                        The  name  of the field that Amazon AppFlow uses as an
                        ID when performing a write operation such as update or
                        delete.

                        (string)

                     errorHandlingConfig -> (structure)
                        The settings that determine how Amazon AppFlow handles
                        an error when placing data in the Salesforce  destina-
                        tion. For example, this setting would determine if the
                        flow should fail after one insertion  error,  or  con-
                        tinue and attempt to insert every record regardless of
                        the initial failure. ErrorHandlingConfig is a part  of
                        the destination connector details.

                        failOnFirstDestinationError -> (boolean)
                            Specifies  if the flow should fail after the first
                            instance of a failure  when  attempting  to  place
                            data in the destination.

                        bucketPrefix -> (string)
                            Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket prefix.

                        bucketName -> (string)
                            Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket.

                     writeOperationType -> (string)
                        This  specifies the type of write operation to be per-
                        formed in Salesforce. When the value is UPSERT ,  then
                        idFieldNames is required.

                     dataTransferApi -> (string)
                        Specifies  which  Salesforce  API  is  used  by Amazon
                        AppFlow when your flow transfers data to Salesforce.
                            AUTOMATIC

                        The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API  to  use
                        based  on  the number of records that your flow trans-
                        fers to Salesforce. If your flow transfers fewer  than
                        1,000  records,  Amazon  AppFlow  uses Salesforce REST
                        API. If your flow transfers  1,000  records  or  more,
                        Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0.

                        Each  of these Salesforce APIs structures data differ-
                        ently. If Amazon AppFlow  selects  the  API  automati-
                        cally,  be  aware  that, for recurring flows, the data
                        output might vary from one flow run to the  next.  For
                        example,  if  a flow runs daily, it might use REST API
                        on one day to transfer 900 records, and it  might  use
                        Bulk  API  2.0  on  the  next  day  to  transfer 1,100
                        records. For each of these flow runs,  the  respective
                        Salesforce  API  formats the data differently. Some of
                        the differences include how dates  are  formatted  and
                        null  values  are  represented.  Also,  Bulk  API  2.0
                        doesn't transfer Salesforce compound fields.

                        By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance
                        for  both  small  and  large  data  transfers, but the
                        tradeoff is inconsistent formatting in the output.
                            BULKV2

                        Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This
                        API runs asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal
                        for large sets of data. By choosing this  option,  you
                        ensure  that  your  flow writes consistent output, but
                        you optimize performance only for  large  data  trans-
                        fers.

                        Note  that  Bulk  API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce
                        compound fields.
                            REST_SYNC

                        Amazon AppFlow  uses  only  Salesforce  REST  API.  By
                        choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes
                        consistent output, but you  decrease  performance  for
                        large  data  transfers that are better suited for Bulk
                        API 2.0. In some  cases,  if  your  flow  attempts  to
                        transfer  a vary large set of data, it might fail with
                        a timed out error.

                        tion. For example, this setting would determine if the
                        flow should fail after one insertion  error,  or  con-
                        tinue and attempt to insert every record regardless of

                        an error when placing data in the destination. For ex-
                        ample, this setting would determine if the flow should
                        fail  after  one  insertion error, or continue and at-
                        tempt to insert every record regardless of the initial
                        failure. ErrorHandlingConfig is a part of the destina-
                        tion connector details.

                        failOnFirstDestinationError -> (boolean)

                 Describes the status of the attempt from  Amazon  AppFlow  to
                 register  the  data partitions with the metadata catalog. The
                 data partitions organize the flow output into a  hierarchical
                 path,  such  as a folder path in an S3 bucket. Amazon AppFlow
                 creates the partitions (if they don't already exist) based on
                 your flow configuration.

                 message -> (string)
