NAME
       describe-connectors -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the connectors vended by Amazon AppFlow for specified connec-
       tor types. If you don't specify a connector type,  this  operation  de-
       scribes all connectors vended by Amazon AppFlow. If there are more con-
       nectors than can be returned in one page, the response contains a next-
       Token  object,  which  can  be be passed in to the next call to the De-
       scribeConnectors API operation to retrieve the next page.

          set. The default is 20.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token for the next page of data.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        from Salesforce. You provide these credentials to Ama-
                        zon AppFlow when you define  the  connection  to  your

                        requests the access token from Salesforce. You provide
