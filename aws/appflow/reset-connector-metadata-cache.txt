RESET-CONNECTOR-METADATA-CACHE()              RESET-CONNECTOR-METADATA-CACHE()



NAME
       reset-connector-metadata-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Resets  metadata  about  your  connector  entities  that Amazon AppFlow
       stored in its cache. Use this action when you want  Amazon  AppFlow  to
       return  the latest information about the data that you have in a source
       application.

       Amazon AppFlow returns metadata about your entities when  you  use  the
       ListConnectorEntities  or  DescribeConnectorEntities actions. Following
       these actions, Amazon AppFlow caches the metadata to reduce the  number
       of  API  requests  that  it must send to the source application. Amazon
       AppFlow automatically resets the cache once every hour, but you can use
       this action when you want to get the latest metadata right away.

OPTIONS
       --connector-profile-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  connector  profile that you want to reset cached
          metadata for.

          You can omit this parameter if you're resetting the cache for any of
          the following connectors: Amazon Connect, Amazon EventBridge, Amazon
          Lookout for Metrics, Amazon S3, or Upsolver. If you're resetting the
          cache  for  any  other connector, you must include this parameter in
          your request.

       --connector-type (string)
          The type of connector to reset cached metadata for.

          You must include this parameter in your request if you're  resetting
          the  cache for any of the following connectors: Amazon Connect, Ama-
          zon EventBridge, Amazon Lookout for Metrics, Amazon S3, or Upsolver.
          If  you're resetting the cache for any other connector, you can omit
          this parameter from your request.

          Possible values:

          o Salesforce

          o Singular

          o Slack

          o Redshift

          o S3

       --connector-entity-name (string)
          Use this parameter if you want to reset cached  metadata  about  the
          details for an individual entity.

          If  you don't include this parameter in your request, Amazon AppFlow
          only resets cached metadata about entity names, not entity details.

       --entities-path (string)
          Use this parameter only if youre resetting the cached metadata about
          a  nested  entity.  Only  some connectors support nested entities. A
          nested entity is one that has another entity as  a  parent.  To  use
          this parameter, specify the name of the parent entity.

          To look up the parent-child relationship of entities, you can send a
          ListConnectorEntities request that omits the entitiesPath parameter.
          Amazon  AppFlow  will  return a list of top-level entities. For each
          one, it indicates whether the entity has nested entities. Then, in a
          subsequent  ListConnectorEntities  request, you can specify a parent
          entity name for the entitiesPath parameter. Amazon AppFlow will  re-
          turn a list of the child entities for that parent.

       --api-version (string)
          The  API  version  that  you specified in the connector profile that
          youre resetting cached metadata for. You  must  use  this  parameter
          only  if the connector supports multiple API versions or if the con-
          nector type is CustomConnector.

          To look up how many versions  a  connector  supports,  use  the  De-
          scribeConnectors action. In the response, find the value that Amazon
          AppFlow returns for the connectorVersion parameter.

          To look up the connector type, use the DescribeConnectorProfiles ac-
          tion.  In  the  response, find the value that Amazon AppFlow returns
          for the connectorType parameter.

          To look up the API version that you specified in  a  connector  pro-
          file, use the DescribeConnectorProfiles action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
