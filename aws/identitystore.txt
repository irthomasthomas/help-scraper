NAME
       identitystore -

DESCRIPTION
       The  Identity  Store service used by AWS IAM Identity Center (successor
       to AWS Single Sign-On) provides a single place to retrieve all of  your
       identities  (users and groups). For more information, see the IAM Iden-
       tity Center User Guide .

       NOTE:
          Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso  and  identitystore
          API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for back-
          ward compatibility purposes. For more information, see IAM  Identity
          Center rename .

       This  reference  guide describes the identity store operations that you
       can call programatically and  includes  detailed  information  on  data
       types and errors.
