DESCRIPTION
       The  Identity  Store service used by Amazon Web Services Single Sign On
       provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities  (users  and
       groups).  For  more  information,  see the Amazon Web Services SSO User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          Although Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On was renamed, the sso and
          identitystore  API namespaces will continue to retain their original
          name for backward compatibility purposes. For more information,  see
          Amazon Web Services SSO rename .

       This  reference  guide describes the identity store operations that you
       can call programatically and  includes  detailed  information  on  data
       types and errors.
