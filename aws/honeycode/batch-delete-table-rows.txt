OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook where the rows are being deleted.

          If  a  workbook  with  the specified id could not be found, this API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table where the rows are being deleted.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --row-ids (list)
          The list of row ids to delete from the table. You need to specify at
          least one row id in this list.

          Note that if one of the row ids provided in the request does not ex-
          ist  in  the  table,  then the request fails and no rows are deleted
          from the table.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-request-token (string)
          The request token for performing the delete action.  Request  tokens
          help  to  identify  duplicate requests. If a call times out or fails
          due to a transient error like a failed network connection,  you  can
          retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that
          if the first call using that  request  token  is  successfully  per-
          formed, the second call will not perform the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after deleting the rows from the table.

       failedBatchItems -> (list)
          The  list  of  row ids in the request that could not be deleted from
          the table. Each element in this list contains one row  id  from  the
          request  that  could  not  be deleted along with the reason why that
          item could not be deleted.

          (structure)
              A single item in a batch that failed to perform the intended ac-
              tion because of an error preventing it from succeeding.

              id -> (string)
                 The  id of the batch item that failed. This is the batch item
                 id for the BatchCreateTableRows and BatchUpsertTableRows  op-
                 erations  and  the  row  id  for the BatchUpdateTableRows and
                 BatchDeleteTableRows operations.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that indicates why the batch item failed.
