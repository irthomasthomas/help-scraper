INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()                          INVOKE-SCREEN-AUTOMATION()



NAME
       invoke-screen-automation -

DESCRIPTION
       The  InvokeScreenAutomation  API allows invoking an action defined in a
       screen in a Honeycode app. The  API  allows  setting  local  variables,
       which can then be used in the automation being invoked. This allows au-
       tomating the Honeycode app interactions to write, update or delete data
       in the workbook.

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook that contains the screen automation.

       --app-id (string)
          The ID of the app that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-id (string)
          The ID of the screen that contains the screen automation.

       --screen-automation-id (string)
          The ID of the automation action to be performed.

       --variables (map)
          Variables  are  specified  as a map where the key is the name of the
          variable as defined on the screen. The value is an object which cur-
          rently has only one property, rawValue, which holds the value of the
          variable to be passed to the screen.  Any  variables  defined  in  a
          screen are required to be passed in the call.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              The input variables to the app to be used by the InvokeScreenAu-
              tomation action request.

              rawValue -> (string)
                 Raw value of the variable.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=rawValue=string,KeyName2=rawValue=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "rawValue": "string"
              }
            ...}

       --row-id (string)
          The row ID for the automation if the automation is defined inside  a
          block with source or list.

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  request token for performing the automation action. Request to-
          kens help to identify duplicate requests. If a  call  times  out  or
          fails due to a transient error like a failed network connection, you
          can retry the call with the same request token. The service  ensures
          that if the first call using that request token is successfully per-
          formed, the second call will return the  response  of  the  previous
          call rather than performing the action again.

          Note  that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
