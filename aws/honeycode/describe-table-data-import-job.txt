OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook into which data was imported.

          If a workbook with the specified id could not  be  found,  this  API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table into which data was imported.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job that was returned by  the  StartTableDataImportJob
          request.

          If  a  job with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
