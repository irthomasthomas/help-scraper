BATCH-UPDATE-TABLE-ROWS()                            BATCH-UPDATE-TABLE-ROWS()



NAME
       batch-update-table-rows -

DESCRIPTION
       The BatchUpdateTableRows API allows you to update one or more rows in a
       table in a workbook.

       You can specify the values to set in some or all of the columns in  the
       table  for  the specified rows. If a column is not explicitly specified
       in a particular row, then that column will not be updated for that row.
       To  clear out the data in a specific cell, you need to set the value as
       an empty string ("").

OPTIONS
       --workbook-id (string)
          The ID of the workbook where the rows are being updated.

          If a workbook with the specified id could not  be  found,  this  API
          throws ResourceNotFoundException.

       --table-id (string)
          The ID of the table where the rows are being updated.

          If a table with the specified id could not be found, this API throws
          ResourceNotFoundException.

       --rows-to-update (list)
          The list of rows to update in the table.  Each  item  in  this  list
          needs  to  contain the row id to update along with the map of column
          id to cell values for each column in that row that needs to  be  up-
          dated.  You  need  to specify at least one row in this list, and for
          each row, you need to specify at least one column to update.

          Note that if one of the row or column ids in the  request  does  not
          exist  in  the table, then the request fails and no updates are made
          to the table.

          (structure)
              Data needed to create a single row in a table  as  part  of  the
              BatchCreateTableRows request.

              rowId -> (string)
                 The id of the row that needs to be updated.

              cellsToUpdate -> (map)
                 A  map representing the cells to update in the given row. The
                 key is the column id  of  the  cell  and  the  value  is  the
                 CellInput  object  that  represents  the  data to set in that
                 cell.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     CellInput object contains the data needed  to  create  or
                     update cells in a table.

                     NOTE:
                        CellInput  object  has  only  a  facts field or a fact
                        field, but not both. A 400 bad request will be  thrown
                        if both fact and facts field are present.

                     fact -> (string)
                        Fact  represents the data that is entered into a cell.
                        This data can be free text or a formula. Formulas need
                        to start with the equals (=) sign.

                     facts -> (list)
                        A list representing the values that are entered into a
                        ROWSET cell. Facts list can have either only values or
                        rowIDs, and rowIDs should from the same table.

                        (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          rowId=string,cellsToUpdate={KeyName1={fact=string,facts=[string,string]},KeyName2={fact=string,facts=[string,string]}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "rowId": "string",
              "cellsToUpdate": {"string": {
                    "fact": "string",
                    "facts": ["string", ...]
                  }
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          The  request  token for performing the update action. Request tokens
          help to identify duplicate requests. If a call times  out  or  fails
          due  to  a transient error like a failed network connection, you can
          retry the call with the same request token. The service ensures that
          if  the  first  call  using  that request token is successfully per-
          formed, the second call will not perform the action again.

          Note that request tokens are valid only for a few minutes. You  can-
          not use request tokens to dedupe requests spanning hours or days.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       workbookCursor -> (long)
          The updated workbook cursor after adding the new rows at the end  of

       failedBatchItems -> (list)
          The  list of batch items in the request that could not be updated in

          why that item could not be updated.

          (structure)

                 The  id of the batch item that failed. This is the batch item
                 id for the BatchCreateTableRows and BatchUpsertTableRows  op-
                 erations  and  the  row  id  for the BatchUpdateTableRows and
                 BatchDeleteTableRows operations.

              errorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message that indicates why the batch item failed.
