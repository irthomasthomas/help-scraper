LIST-LAUNCH-PROFILES()                                  LIST-LAUNCH-PROFILES()



NAME
       list-launch-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       List all the launch profiles a studio.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-launch-profiles  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: launchProfiles

OPTIONS
       --principal-id (string)
          The principal ID. This currently  supports  a  IAM  Identity  Center
          UserId.

       --states (list)
          Filter this request to launch profiles in any of the given states.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CREATE_IN_PROGRESS
            READY
            UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETE_IN_PROGRESS
            DELETED
            DELETE_FAILED
            CREATE_FAILED
            UPDATE_FAILED

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       launchProfiles -> (list)
          A collection of launch profiles.

          (structure)
              A launch profile controls your artist workforces access to  stu-
              dio components, like compute farms, shared file systems, managed
              file systems, and license server configurations, as well as  in-
              stance types and Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

              Studio  administrators create launch profiles in the Nimble Stu-
              dio console. Artists can use their launch profiles to launch  an
              instance  from  the Nimble Studio portal. Each users launch pro-
              file defines how they can launch a  streaming  session.  By  de-
              fault, studio admins can use all launch profiles.

              arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that is assigned to a studio
                 resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are  unique  across
                 all Regions.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  ISO  timestamp in seconds for when the resource was cre-
                 ated.

              createdBy -> (string)
                 The user ID of the user that created the launch profile.

              description -> (string)
                 A human-readable description of the launch profile.

              ec2SubnetIds -> (list)
                 Unique identifiers for a collection of EC2 subnets.

                     profile should be terminated  automatically  or  retained
                     without termination after being in a STOPPED state.

                     o When ACTIVATED , the streaming session is scheduled for
                       termination after being in the STOPPED  state  for  the
                       time specified in maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes .

                     o When  DEACTIVATED , the streaming session can remain in
                       the STOPPED state indefinitely.

                     This parameter is only allowed  when  sessionPersistence-
                     Mode  is  ACTIVATED . When allowed, the default value for
                     this parameter is DEACTIVATED .

                     (string)

                 maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  length of time, in minutes, that a streaming session
                     can be active before it is stopped or  terminated.  After
                     this  point,  Nimble  Studio  automatically terminates or
                     stops the session. The default length of time is 690 min-
                     utes, and the maximum length of time is 30 days.

                 maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                     Integer  that  determines  if you can start and stop your
                     sessions and how long a session can stay in  the  STOPPED
                     state. The default value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

                     This field is allowed only when sessionPersistenceMode is
                     ACTIVATED and automaticTerminationMode is ACTIVATED .

                     If the value is set to 0, your sessions cant be STOPPED .
                     If  you  then  call  StopStreamingSession  ,  the session
                     fails. If the time that a  session  stays  in  the  READY
                     state  exceeds  the  maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the
                     session will  automatically  be  terminated  (instead  of
                     STOPPED ).

                     If the value is set to a positive number, the session can
                     be stopped. You can  call  StopStreamingSession  to  stop
                     sessions  in  the READY state. If the time that a session
                     stays in the READY state exceeds the  maxSessionLengthIn-
                     Minutes  value, the session will automatically be stopped
                     (instead of terminated).

                        Configures  backups  for  streaming  sessions launched
                        with this launch profile. The default value is DEACTI-
                        VATED  ,  which means that backups are deactivated. To
                        allow backups, set this value to AUTOMATIC .
