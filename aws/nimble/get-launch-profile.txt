OPTIONS
       --launch-profile-id (string)
          The ID of the launch profile used to control access from the stream-
          ing session.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              The status message for the launch profile.

          streamConfiguration -> (structure)
              A configuration for a streaming session.

              automaticTerminationMode -> (string)
                 Indicates  if  a  streaming  session created from this launch
                 profile should be terminated automatically or retained  with-
                 out termination after being in a STOPPED state.

                 o When  ACTIVATED  ,  the  streaming session is scheduled for
                   termination after being in the STOPPED state for  the  time
                   specified in maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes .

                 o When  DEACTIVATED , the streaming session can remain in the
                   STOPPED state indefinitely.

                 This parameter is only allowed when sessionPersistenceMode is
                 ACTIVATED  . When allowed, the default value for this parame-
                 ter is DEACTIVATED .

              clipboardMode -> (string)
                 Allows or deactivates the use of the system clipboard to copy
                 and paste between the streaming session and streaming client.

              ec2InstanceTypes -> (list)
                 The  EC2  instance  types  that  users  can  select from when
                 launching a streaming session with this launch profile.

                 (string)

              maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The length of time, in minutes, that a streaming session  can
                 be  active  before  it  is  stopped or terminated. After this
                 point, Nimble Studio automatically terminates  or  stops  the
                 session.  The  default length of time is 690 minutes, and the
                 maximum length of time is 30 days.

              maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Integer that determines if you can start and stop  your  ses-
                 sions  and  how long a session can stay in the STOPPED state.
                 The default value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

                 This field is allowed only when sessionPersistenceMode is AC-
                 TIVATED and automaticTerminationMode is ACTIVATED .

                 If  the value is set to 0, your sessions cant be STOPPED . If
                 you then call StopStreamingSession , the  session  fails.  If
                 the  time that a session stays in the READY state exceeds the
                 maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the session  will  automati-
                 cally be terminated (instead of STOPPED ).

                 If  the value is set to a positive number, the session can be
                 stopped. You can call StopStreamingSession to  stop  sessions
                 in  the  READY state. If the time that a session stays in the
                 READY state exceeds the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value,  the
                 session  will  automatically  be  stopped  (instead of termi-
                 nated).

              sessionBackup -> (structure)
                 Information about the streaming session backup.

                 maxBackupsToRetain -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of backups that each streaming session
                     created from this launch profile can have.

                 mode -> (string)
                     Specifies how artists sessions are backed up.

                     Configures  backups  for streaming sessions launched with
                     this launch profile. The default value is  DEACTIVATED  ,
                     which  means that backups are deactivated. To allow back-
                     ups, set this value to AUTOMATIC .

              sessionPersistenceMode -> (string)
                 Determine if a streaming session  created  from  this  launch
                 profile  can  configure  persistent  storage. This means that
                 volumeConfiguration and automaticTerminationMode are  config-
                 ured.

              sessionStorage -> (structure)
                 The upload storage for a streaming session.

                 mode -> (list)
                     Allows artists to upload files to their workstations. The
                     only valid option is UPLOAD .

                     (string)

                 root -> (structure)
                     The configuration for the  upload  storage  root  of  the
                     streaming session.

                        The  folder path in Linux workstations where files are
                        uploaded.

                     windows -> (string)
                        The folder path in Windows  workstations  where  files
                        are uploaded.

              streamingImageIds -> (list)
                 The  streaming images that users can select from when launch-
                 ing a streaming session with this launch profile.
