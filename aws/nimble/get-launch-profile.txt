NAME
       get-launch-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Get a launch profile.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-launch-profile
          --launch-profile-id <value>
          --studio-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --launch-profile-id (string)
          The Launch Profile ID.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          launchProfileProtocolVersions -> (list)
              The  version  number  of the protocol that is used by the launch
              profile. The only valid version is "2021-03-31".

              (string)
                 The version number of the protocol that is used by the launch
                 profile. The only valid version is "2021-03-31".

          name -> (string)
              A friendly name for the launch profile.

          state -> (string)
              The current state.

          statusCode -> (string)
              The status code.

          statusMessage -> (string)
              The status message for the launch profile.

          streamConfiguration -> (structure)
              A configuration for a streaming session.

              clipboardMode -> (string)
                 Enable or disable the use of the system clipboard to copy and
                 paste between the streaming session and streaming client.

              ec2InstanceTypes -> (list)
                 The EC2 instance  types  that  users  can  select  from  when
                 launching a streaming session with this launch profile.

                 (string)

              maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  length of time, in minutes, that a streaming session can
                 be active before it is  stopped  or  terminated.  After  this
                 point,  Nimble  Studio  automatically terminates or stops the
                 session. The default length of time is 690 minutes,  and  the
                 maximum length of time is 30 days.

              maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Integer  that  determines if you can start and stop your ses-
                 sions and how long a session can stay in the  STOPPED  state.
                 The default value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

                 If  the  value  is missing or set to 0, your sessions cant be
                 stopped. If you then call StopStreamingSession , the  session
                 fails.  If  the  time that a session stays in the READY state
                 exceeds the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the session will
                 automatically be terminated by AWS (instead of stopped).

                 If  the value is set to a positive number, the session can be
                 stopped. You can call StopStreamingSession to  stop  sessions
                 in  the  READY state. If the time that a session stays in the
                 READY state exceeds the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value,  the
                 session will automatically be stopped by AWS (instead of ter-
                 minated).

              sessionStorage -> (structure)
                 (Optional) The upload storage for a streaming session.

                 mode -> (list)
                     Allows artists to upload files to their workstations. The

                 root -> (structure)
                     The  configuration  for  the  upload  storage root of the
                     streaming session.

                     linux -> (string)
                        The folder path in Linux workstations where files  are
                        uploaded.

                     windows -> (string)
                        The  folder  path  in Windows workstations where files
                        are uploaded.

              streamingImageIds -> (list)
                 The streaming images that users can select from when  launch-

              Unique  identifiers  for  a collection of studio components that
              can be used with this launch profile.

          tags -> (map)
              A collection of labels, in the form of key:value pairs, that ap-
              ply to this resource.
