OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the backup.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          Amazon  Web  Services SDK automatically generates a client token and
          uses it for the request to ensure idempotency.

       --session-id (string)
          The streaming session ID for the StartStreamingSessionRequest .

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID for the StartStreamingSessionRequest.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

              Indicates if a streaming session created from this  launch  pro-
              file should be terminated automatically or retained without ter-
              mination after being in a STOPPED state.

              o When ACTIVATED , the streaming session is scheduled for termi-
                nation after being in the STOPPED state for the time specified

                STOPPED state indefinitely.

              This  parameter  is  only allowed when sessionPersistenceMode is
              ACTIVATED . When allowed, the default value for  this  parameter
