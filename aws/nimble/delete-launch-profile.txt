OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          Amazon  Web  Services SDK automatically generates a client token and
          uses it for the request to ensure idempotency.

       --launch-profile-id (string)
          The ID of the launch profile used to control access from the stream-
          ing session.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                 profile  should be terminated automatically or retained with-
                 out termination after being in a STOPPED state.

                 o When ACTIVATED , the streaming  session  is  scheduled  for
                   termination  after  being in the STOPPED state for the time
                   specified in maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes .

                 o When DEACTIVATED , the streaming session can remain in  the
                   STOPPED state indefinitely.

                 This parameter is only allowed when sessionPersistenceMode is
                 ACTIVATED . When allowed, the default value for this  parame-
                 ter is DEACTIVATED .

              clipboardMode -> (string)
                 Allows or deactivates the use of the system clipboard to copy
                 and paste between the streaming session and streaming client.

                 The EC2 instance  types  that  users  can  select  from  when
                 launching a streaming session with this launch profile.

                 (string)

              maxSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  length of time, in minutes, that a streaming session can
                 be active before it is  stopped  or  terminated.  After  this
                 point,  Nimble  Studio  automatically terminates or stops the
                 session. The default length of time is 690 minutes,  and  the
                 maximum length of time is 30 days.

              maxStoppedSessionLengthInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Integer  that  determines if you can start and stop your ses-
                 sions and how long a session can stay in the  STOPPED  state.
                 The default value is 0. The maximum value is 5760.

                 This field is allowed only when sessionPersistenceMode is AC-
                 TIVATED and automaticTerminationMode is ACTIVATED .

                 If the value is set to 0, your sessions cant be STOPPED .  If
                 you  then  call  StopStreamingSession , the session fails. If
                 the time that a session stays in the READY state exceeds  the
                 maxSessionLengthInMinutes  value,  the session will automati-
                 cally be terminated (instead of STOPPED ).

                 If the value is set to a positive number, the session can  be
                 stopped.  You  can call StopStreamingSession to stop sessions
                 in the READY state. If the time that a session stays  in  the
                 READY  state exceeds the maxSessionLengthInMinutes value, the
                 session will automatically  be  stopped  (instead  of  termi-
                 nated).

              sessionBackup -> (structure)
                 Information about the streaming session backup.

                 maxBackupsToRetain -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of backups that each streaming session
                     created from this launch profile can have.

                 mode -> (string)
                     Specifies how artists sessions are backed up.

                     Configures backups for streaming sessions  launched  with
                     this  launch  profile. The default value is DEACTIVATED ,
                     which means that backups are deactivated. To allow  back-
                     ups, set this value to AUTOMATIC .

              sessionPersistenceMode -> (string)
                 Determine  if  a  streaming  session created from this launch
                 profile can configure persistent  storage.  This  means  that
                 volumeConfiguration  and automaticTerminationMode are config-
                 ured.

              sessionStorage -> (structure)

                        are uploaded.

              streamingImageIds -> (list)
                 The streaming images that users can select from when  launch-
