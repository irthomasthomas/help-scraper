START-STUDIO-SSO-CONFIGURATION-REPAIR()START-STUDIO-SSO-CONFIGURATION-REPAIR()



NAME
       start-studio-sso-configuration-repair -

DESCRIPTION
       Repairs the IAM Identity Center configuration for a given studio.

       If  the  studio has a valid IAM Identity Center configuration currently
       associated with it, this operation will fail with a validation error.

       If the studio does not have a valid IAM Identity  Center  configuration
       currently  associated  with it, then a new IAM Identity Center applica-
       tion is created for the studio and the studio is changed to  the  READY
       state.

       After the IAM Identity Center application is repaired, you must use the
       Amazon Nimble Studio console to add administrators and  users  to  your
       studio.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request. If you dont specify a client token,  the
          AWS  SDK  automatically generates a client token and uses it for the
          request to ensure idempotency.

       --studio-id (string)
          The studio ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)
