GET-FINDINGS()                                                  GET-FINDINGS()



NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of findings that match the specified criteria.

       If  finding aggregation is enabled, then when you call GetFindings from
       the aggregation Region, the results include all of the  matching  find-
       ings from both the aggregation Region and the linked Regions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Findings

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          The finding attributes used to define a condition to filter the  re-
          turned findings.

          You  can  filter by up to 10 finding attributes. For each attribute,
          you can provide up to 20 filter values.

          Note that in the available filter fields,  WorkflowState  is  depre-
          cated.  To  search  for  a finding based on its workflow status, use
          WorkflowStatus .

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID in which a finding is  gener-
              ated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the

                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          GeneratorId -> (list)
              The identifier for the solution-specific component  (a  discrete
              unit  of  logic)  that  generated a finding. In various security
              findings providers' solutions, this generator can  be  called  a
              rule, a check, a detector, a plugin, etc.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Type -> (list)
              A  finding  type  in the format of namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

              A  timestamp  that indicates when the security findings provider
              first observed the potential security issue that a finding  cap-

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Confidence -> (list)
              A  finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood
              that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue  that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

                 Lt -> (double)
                     The less-than condition to be applied to a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The level of importance assigned  to  the  resources  associated
              with the finding.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Gt -> (double)
                     The  greater-than  condition  to  be  applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Lt -> (double)
                     The less-than condition to be applied to a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Description -> (list)
              A finding's description.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding

                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A URL that links to a page about the current finding in the  se-
              curity findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A data type where security findings providers can include  addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for filtering Security Hub  findings.  Each  map
                 filter  provides  the  field to check for, the value to check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to the key value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter  Department  CONTAINS  Security matches findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                       field, the filter Department  EQUALS  Security  matches
                       findings  that  have the value Security for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS and EQUALS filters  on  the  same  field  are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of those filters. For example, the filters  Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To  search  for  values that don't have the filter value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  find-
                       ings  that  dont have the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same  field
                        are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department   NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND  Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS Finance match  a  finding  that  excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS  filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
                        filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only  be  used  with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly, you cant  have  both
                     an  EQUALS  filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The  name of the findings provider (company) that owns the solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          UserDefinedFields -> (list)
              A  list  of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
              These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for filtering Security Hub  findings.  Each  map
                 filter  provides  the  field to check for, the value to check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to the key value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter  Department  CONTAINS  Security matches findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                       field, the filter Department  EQUALS  Security  matches
                       findings  that  have the value Security for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS and EQUALS filters  on  the  same  field  are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of those filters. For example, the filters  Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To  search  for  values that don't have the filter value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  find-
                       ings  that  dont have the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same  field
                        are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department   NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND  Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS Finance match  a  finding  that  excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS  filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
                        filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only  be  used  with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly, you cant  have  both
                     an  EQUALS  filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          MalwareType -> (list)
              The type of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          MalwarePath -> (list)
              The filesystem path of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates the direction of network  traffic  associated  with  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NetworkProtocol -> (list)
              The protocol of network-related information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
              The source media access control (MAC) address of network-related
              information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)

          NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
              The destination domain of network-related  information  about  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProcessPath -> (list)
              The path to the process executable.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-

                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub

                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorType -> (list)
              The type of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ThreatIntelIndicatorValue -> (list)
              The value of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ThreatIntelIndicatorCategory -> (list)
              The category of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

                     can end with Z or ("+" / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute]
                     . The time-secfrac after seconds is limited to a  maximum
                     of  9 digits. The offset is bounded by +/-18:00. Here are
                     valid timestamp formats with examples:

                       )

                     o YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmmmmmZ       (for      example,
                       2019-01-31T23:00:00.123456789Z )

                     o YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+HH:MM         (for         example,

                 End -> (string)
                     A  timestamp that provides the end date for the date fil-
                     ter.

                     This field accepts only the specified formats. Timestamps
                     can end with Z or ("+" / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute]

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)
              The URL for more details from the source of the threat  intelli-
              gence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-

                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

          ResourceId -> (list)
              The canonical identifier for the given resource type.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the Region
              is assigned to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The  canonical  Amazon  Web  Services external Region name where
              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding

                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for filtering Security Hub  findings.  Each  map
                 filter  provides  the  field to check for, the value to check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to the key value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter  Department  CONTAINS  Security matches findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                       field, the filter Department  EQUALS  Security  matches
                       findings  that  have the value Security for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS and EQUALS filters  on  the  same  field  are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of those filters. For example, the filters  Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To  search  for  values that don't have the filter value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  find-
                       ings  that  dont have the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same  field
                        are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department   NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND  Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS Finance match  a  finding  that  excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS  filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
                        filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only  be  used  with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly, you cant  have  both
                     an  EQUALS  filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For

              The key name associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIamInstanceProfileArn -> (list)
              The IAM profile ARN of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceVpcId -> (list)
              The identifier of the VPC that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding

              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

                     This field accepts only the specified formats. Timestamps
                     can end with Z or ("+" / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute]
                     .  The time-secfrac after seconds is limited to a maximum
                     of 9 digits. The offset is bounded by +/-18:00. Here  are
                     valid timestamp formats with examples:

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)
              The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyUserName -> (list)
              The user associated with the IAM access key related to  a  find-
              ing.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
              The name of the principal that is associated with an IAM  access
              key.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have

                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.

                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter

                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-

                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsIamUserUserName -> (list)
              The name of an IAM user.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceContainerName -> (list)
              The name of the container related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-

                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the

                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceContainerImageName -> (list)
              The name of the image related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that

                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              A timestamp that identifies when the container was started.

              This field accepts only the specified  formats.  Timestamps  can
              end  with  Z  or  ("+"  / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute] . The
              time-secfrac after seconds is limited to a maximum of 9  digits.
              The offset is bounded by +/-18:00. Here are valid timestamp for-
              mats with examples:

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the start  date  for  the  date
                     filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The status of the investigation into a finding.  Allowed  values
              are the following.

              o NEW  -  The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed.
                Security Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED  or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED to either WARNING ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about  the  security  issue. Used when the initial reviewer is
                not the resource owner, and needs intervention  from  the  re-
                source  owner.  If  one  of the following occurs, the workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING  ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED  -  Indicates  that you reviewed the finding and do
                not believe that any action is needed. The workflow status  of
                a  SUPPRESSED  finding  does not change if RecordState changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is  now
                considered  resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING  ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In  those  cases,  the workflow status is automatically reset to
              NEW .

              For findings from controls, if  Compliance.Status  is  PASSED  ,
              then  Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to RE-
              SOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RecordState -> (list)
              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The solution-generated identifier for a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NoteText -> (list)
              The text of a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A  timestamp  that  provides  the start date for the date
                     filter.

                     This field accepts only the specified formats. Timestamps
                     can end with Z or ("+" / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute]
                     . The time-secfrac after seconds is limited to a  maximum
                     of  9 digits. The offset is bounded by +/-18:00. Here are
                     valid timestamp formats with examples:

                 End -> (string)
                     A  timestamp that provides the end date for the date fil-

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the  finding  confidence.  Confi-
              dence  is  defined  as  the likelihood that a finding accurately
              identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended  to  iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)

                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the level of importance  assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

              (structure)

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The finding identifier of a related finding that  is  identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding that is
              identified by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the severity label.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only

                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityOriginal -> (list)
              The finding provider's original value for the severity.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsTypes -> (list)
              One or more finding types that the finding provider assigned  to
              the  finding.  Uses  the format of namespace/category/classifier
              that classify a finding.

              Valid namespace values are: Software and Configuration Checks  |
              TTPs  | Effects | Unusual Behaviors | Sensitive Data Identifica-
              tions

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub

                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Sample -> (list)
              Indicates  whether  or  not  sample findings are included in the
              filter results.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          VulnerabilitiesExploitAvailable -> (list)
              Indicates  whether  a software vulnerability in your environment
              has a known exploit. You can filter findings by this field  only
              if you use Security Hub and Amazon Inspector.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding

          VulnerabilitiesFixAvailable -> (list)
              Indicates whether a vulnerability is fixed in a newer version of
              the  affected software packages. You can filter findings by this
              field only if you use Security Hub and Amazon Inspector.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceSecurityControlParametersName -> (list)
              The name of a security control parameter.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceSecurityControlParametersValue -> (list)
              The current value of a security control parameter.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with

                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceApplicationName -> (list)
              The name of the application that is related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceApplicationArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the application that is related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS

                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The finding attributes used to sort the list of returned findings.

          (structure)
              A collection of finding attributes used to sort findings.

              Field -> (string)
                 The finding attribute used to sort findings.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order used to sort findings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Field=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Field": "string",
              "SortOrder": "asc"|"desc"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

       Example 1: To return findings generated for a specific standard

       The following get-findings example returns findings  for  the  PCI  DSS
       standard.

          aws securityhub get-findings \
              --filters '{"GeneratorId":[{"Value": "pci-dss","Comparison":"PREFIX"}]}' \

OUTPUT
       Findings -> (list)
          The findings that matched the filters specified in the request.

          (structure)
              Provides a consistent format for Security Hub findings. AwsSecu-
              rityFinding format allows you to share findings  between  Amazon
              Web Services security services and third-party solutions.

              NOTE:
                 A  finding  is a potential security issue generated either by
                 Amazon Web Services services or by the integrated third-party
                 solutions and standards checks.

              SchemaVersion -> (string)
                 The schema version that a finding is formatted for.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  security  findings  provider-specific  identifier  for a
                 finding.

              ProductArn -> (string)
                 The ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies  a
                 product  that  generates  findings. This can be the ARN for a
                 third-party product that is integrated with Security Hub,  or
                 the ARN for a custom integration.

              ProductName -> (string)
                 The name of the product that generated the finding.

                 Security  Hub populates this attribute automatically for each
                 finding. You  cannot  update  this  attribute  with  BatchIm-
                 portFindings  or  BatchUpdateFindings . The exception to this
                 is a custom integration.

                 When you use the Security Hub console or API to filter  find-
                 ings by product name, you use this attribute.

              CompanyName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the company for the product that generated the
                 finding.

                 Security Hub populates this attribute automatically for  each
                 finding.  You  cannot  update  this  attribute  with BatchIm-
                 portFindings or BatchUpdateFindings . The exception  to  this
                 is a custom integration.

                 When  you use the Security Hub console or API to filter find-
                 ings by company name, you use this attribute.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region from which the finding was generated.

                 Security Hub populates this attribute automatically for  each
                 finding.  You  cannot  update it using BatchImportFindings or
                 BatchUpdateFindings .

              GeneratorId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the solution-specific  component  (a  dis-
                 crete unit of logic) that generated a finding. In various se-
                 curity findings providers' solutions, this generator  can  be
                 called a rule, a check, a detector, a plugin, etc.

              AwsAccountId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that a finding is gener-
                 ated in.

              Types -> (list)
                 One or more finding types in the  format  of  namespace/cate-
                 gory/classifier that classify a finding.

                 Valid namespace values are: Software and Configuration Checks
                 | TTPs | Effects | Unusual Behaviors | Sensitive Data Identi-
                 fications

                 (string)

              FirstObservedAt -> (string)
                 Indicates  when the security findings provider first observed
                 the potential security issue that a finding captured.

                 This field accepts only the specified formats. Timestamps can
                 end  with  Z or ("+" / "-") time-hour [":" time-minute] . The
                 time-secfrac after seconds is limited to a maximum of 9  dig-
                 its.  The offset is bounded by +/-18:00. Here are valid time-
                 stamp formats with examples:

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Specifies how you want  WAF  to  re-
                                          spond  to  requests  that  match the
                                          settings in a rule.

                                          Valid settings include  the  follow-
                                          ing:

                                          o ALLOW - WAF allows requests

                                          o BLOCK - WAF blocks requests

                                          o COUNT  -  WAF increments a counter
                                            of the requests that match all  of
                                            the  conditions  in  the rule. WAF
                                            then continues to inspect the  web
                                            request  based  on  the  remaining
                                            rules in the web  ACL.  You  can't
                                            specify  COUNT for the default ac-
                                            tion for a web ACL.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules to exclude from a rule group.

                                      (structure)
                                          Details about a rule to exclude from
                                          a rule group.

                                          RuleId -> (string)
                                             The  unique  identifier  for  the
                                             rule to  exclude  from  the  rule
                                             group.

                                   OverrideAction -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  OverrideAction  to  test  your
                                      RuleGroup .

                                      Any rule in a RuleGroup can  potentially
                                      block  a  request.  If you set the Over-
                                      rideAction  to  None  ,  the   RuleGroup
                                      blocks  a request if any individual rule
                                      in the RuleGroup matches the request and
                                      is configured to block that request.

                                      However,  if  you first want to test the
                                      RuleGroup , set  the  OverrideAction  to
                                      Count . The RuleGroup then overrides any
                                      block  action  specified  by  individual
                                      rules  contained  within  the group. In-
                                      stead  of  blocking  matching  requests,
                                      those requests are counted.
                                          ActivatedRule

                                          OverrideAction applies only when up-
                                          dating or adding a  RuleGroup  to  a
                                          web ACL. In this case you do not use
                                          ActivatedRule   Action  .  For   all
                                          other update requests, ActivatedRule
                                          Action is used instead of  Activate-
                                          dRule  OverrideAction .

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Specifies  the  order in which the rules
                                      in a web ACL are evaluated. Rules with a

                                      The field to apply the placement  strat-
                                      egy against.

                                      For the spread placement strategy, valid
                                      values are instanceId (or host  ,  which
                                      has the same effect), or any platform or

                               on Fargate. If a platform version is not speci-
                               fied,  the  LATEST  platform version is used by
                               default.

                            PropagateTags -> (string)

                               the  task  definition  to  the task or from the
                               service to the task. If no value  is  provided,
                               then tags are not propagated.

                               the service. The role  allows  the  Amazon  ECS
                               container agent to register container instances
                               with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

                            SchedulingStrategy -> (string)

                               The  REPLICA  scheduling  strategy  places  and
                               maintains  the  desired  number of tasks across
                               the cluster. By default, the service  scheduler
                               spreads  tasks  across Availability Zones. Task
                               placement strategies and constraints  are  used
                               to customize task placement decisions.

                               The  DAEMON scheduling strategy deploys exactly
                               one task on each active container instance that
                               meets  all  of  the  task placement constraints
                               that are specified in the cluster. The  service
                               scheduler  also  evaluates  the  task placement
                               constraints for running tasks and  stops  tasks
                               that do not meet the placement constraints.

                               For an alarm based on a metric, you must  spec-
                               ify  either  Statistic or ExtendedStatistic but
                               not both.

                                      value of Priority . WAF processes  rules
                                      with  lower  priority first. The priori-
                                      ties don't need to be  consecutive,  but
                                      they must all be different.

                     o NOTIFIED  -  Indicates  that  you notified the resource
                       owner about the security issue. Used when  the  initial
                       reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs interven-
                       tion from the resource owner.

                     o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you  reviewed  the  finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The find-
                       ing is no longer updated.
