NAME
       batch-get-configuration-policy-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  associations between an Security Hub configuration and a batch
       of target accounts, organizational units, or the root. Only  the  Secu-
       rity  Hub  delegated  administrator  can invoke this operation from the
       home Region. A configuration can refer to a configuration policy or  to
       a self-managed configuration.

OPTIONS
       --configuration-policy-association-identifiers (list)
          Specifies  one  or more target account IDs, organizational unit (OU)
          IDs, or the root ID to retrieve associations for.

          (structure)
              Provides details about the association between an  Security  Hub
              configuration  and a target account, organizational unit, or the
              root. An association can exist between a target and a configura-
              tion policy, or between a target and self-managed behavior.

              Target -> (tagged union structure)
                 The target account, organizational unit, or the root.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set:  AccountId,  Organization-
                     alUnitId, RootId.

                 AccountId -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID of the target account.

                 OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                     The  organizational  unit ID of the target organizational
                     unit.

                 RootId -> (string)
                     The ID of the organization root.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Target={AccountId=string,OrganizationalUnitId=string,RootId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Target": {
                "AccountId": "string",
                "OrganizationalUnitId": "string",
                "RootId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get configuration association details for a batch of targets
