OPTIONS
       --security-control-ids (list)
          A list of security controls (identified with SecurityControlId , Se-
          curityControlArn  ,  or a mix of both parameters). The security con-
          trol ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is the same across standards.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SecurityControls -> (list)
          An  array  that  returns the identifier, Amazon Resource Name (ARN),
          and other details about a security control. The same information  is
          returned whether the request includes SecurityControlId or Security-
          ControlArn .

          (structure)
              A security control in Security Hub  describes  a  security  best
              practice related to a specific resource.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of a security control across standards.
                 Values for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vice name and a number, such as APIGateway.3.

              SecurityControlArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a security control across
                 standards,      such      as      arn:aws:securityhub:eu-cen-
                 tral-1:123456789012:security-control/S3.1  .  This  parameter
                 doesn't mention a specific standard.

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of a security control.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of a security control across standards.  This
                 typically  summarizes  how Security Hub evaluates the control
                 and the conditions under which it produces a failed  finding.
                 This parameter doesn't reference a specific standard.

              RemediationUrl -> (string)
                 A link to Security Hub documentation that explains how to re-
                 mediate a failed finding for a security control.

              SeverityRating -> (string)
                 The severity of a  security  control.  For  more  information
                 about  how  Security  Hub  determines  control  severity, see
                 Assigning severity to control findings in  the  Security  Hub
                 User Guide .

              SecurityControlStatus -> (string)
                 The status of a security control based on the compliance sta-
                 tus of its findings. For more information about  how  control
                 status is determined, see Determining the overall status of a
                 control from its findings in the Security Hub User Guide .

       UnprocessedIds -> (list)
          A security control (identified with SecurityControlId , SecurityCon-
          trolArn  ,  or a mix of both parameters) for which details cannot be
          returned.

          (structure)
              Provides details about a security control for which  a  response
              couldn't be returned.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 The control (identified with SecurityControlId , SecurityCon-
                 trolArn , or a mix of both parameters) for which  a  response
                 couldn't be returned.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code for the unprocessed security control.

              ErrorReason -> (string)
                 The reason why the security control was unprocessed.
