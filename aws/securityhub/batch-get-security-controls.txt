OPTIONS
       --security-control-ids (list)
          A list of security controls (identified with SecurityControlId , Se-
          curityControlArn  ,  or a mix of both parameters). The security con-
          trol ID or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) is the same across standards.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following batch-get-security-controls example gets details for Con-
       fig.1 and IAM.1 in the current AWS account and AWS Region.

OUTPUT
       SecurityControls -> (list)
          An array that returns the identifier, Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN),
          and  other details about a security control. The same information is

              practice related to a specific resource.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of a security control across standards.
                 Values for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vice name and a number, such as APIGateway.3.

              SecurityControlArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a security control  across
                 standards,      such      as      arn:aws:securityhub:eu-cen-
                 tral-1:123456789012:security-control/S3.1  .  This  parameter
                 doesn't mention a specific standard.

                 The title of a security control.

              Description -> (string)

                 typically summarizes how Security Hub evaluates  the  control
                 and  the conditions under which it produces a failed finding.
                 This parameter doesn't reference a specific standard.

              RemediationUrl -> (string)
                 A link to Security Hub documentation that explains how to re-

                 The  severity  of  a  security  control. For more information
                 about how  Security  Hub  determines  control  severity,  see

                 The control (identified with SecurityControlId , SecurityCon-
                 trolArn  ,  or a mix of both parameters) for which a response
                 couldn't be returned.
