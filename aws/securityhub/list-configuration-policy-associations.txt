LIST-CONFIGURATION-POLICY-ASSOCIATIONSLIST-CONFIGURATION-POLICY-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-configuration-policy-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  information  about  the  associations  for your configuration
       policies and self-managed behavior. Only the Security Hub delegated ad-
       ministrator can invoke this operation from the home Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-configuration-policy-associations is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions:  ConfigurationPolicyAssociationSum-
       maries

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          Options  for  filtering  the ListConfigurationPolicyAssociations re-
          sponse. You can filter by the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or  univer-
          sally unique identifier (UUID) of a configuration, AssociationType ,
          or AssociationStatus .

          ConfigurationPolicyId -> (string)
              The ARN or UUID of the configuration policy.

          AssociationType -> (string)
              Indicates whether the association between a target and a config-
              uration  was  directly applied by the Security Hub delegated ad-
              ministrator or inherited from a parent.

          AssociationStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the association between  a  target  and  a
              configuration policy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigurationPolicyId=string,AssociationType=string,AssociationStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigurationPolicyId": "string",
            "AssociationType": "INHERITED"|"APPLIED",
            "AssociationStatus": "PENDING"|"SUCCESS"|"FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following list-configuration-policy-associations  example  lists  a
       summary  of  configuration  associations  for the organization. The re-
       sponse include associations with configuration policies  and  self-man-
       aged behavior.
