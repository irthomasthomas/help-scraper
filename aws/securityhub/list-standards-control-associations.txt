NAME
       list-standards-control-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Specifies  whether  a  control is currently enabled or disabled in each
       enabled standard in the calling account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-standards-control-associations is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: StandardsControlAssociationSummaries

OPTIONS
       --security-control-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the control (identified with SecurityControlId ,
          SecurityControlArn , or a mix of both parameters) that you  want  to
          determine the enablement status of in each enabled standard.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       StandardsControlAssociationSummaries -> (list)
          An  array  that provides the enablement status and other details for
          each security control that applies to each enabled standard.

          (structure)
              An array that provides the enablement status and  other  details
              for each control that applies to each enabled standard.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a standard.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 A  unique  standard-agnostic identifier for a control. Values
                 for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Service and
                 a  number, such as APIGateway.5. This field doesn't reference
                 a specific standard.

              SecurityControlArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a  control,  such  as  arn:aws:securityhub:eu-cen-
                 tral-1:123456789012:security-control/S3.1  .  This  parameter
                 doesn't mention a specific standard.

              AssociationStatus -> (string)
                 The enablement status of a control in a specific standard.

              RelatedRequirements -> (list)

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  last time that a control's enablement status in a speci-
                 fied standard was updated.

              UpdatedReason -> (string)
                 The reason for updating the control's enablement status in  a
                 specified standard.

              StandardsControlTitle -> (string)

              StandardsControlDescription -> (string)
                 The  description  of a control. This typically summarizes how
                 Security Hub evaluates the control and the  conditions  under

                 ence a specific standard.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination parameter that's included in the response  only  if  it
