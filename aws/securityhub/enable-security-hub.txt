ENABLE-SECURITY-HUB()                                    ENABLE-SECURITY-HUB()



NAME
       enable-security-hub -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  Security Hub for your account in the current Region or the Re-
       gion you specify in the request.

       When you enable Security Hub, you grant to Security Hub the permissions
       necessary  to  gather  findings from other services that are integrated
       with Security Hub.

       When you use the EnableSecurityHub operation to  enable  Security  Hub,
       you also automatically enable the following standards:

       o Center  for  Internet  Security (CIS) Amazon Web Services Foundations
         Benchmark v1.2.0

       o Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices

       Other standards are not automatically enabled.

       To opt out of automatically enabled standards,  set  EnableDefaultStan-
       dards to false .

       After  you  enable Security Hub, to enable a standard, use the BatchEn-
       ableStandards operation. To disable a standard, use  the  BatchDisable-
       Standards operation.

       To learn more, see the setup information in the Security Hub User Guide
       .

OPTIONS
       --tags (map)
          The tags to add to the hub resource when you enable Security Hub.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --enable-default-standards | --no-enable-default-standards (boolean)
          Whether to enable the security standards that Security Hub has  des-
          ignated  as automatically enabled. If you do not provide a value for
          EnableDefaultStandards , it is set to true . To not enable the auto-
          matically enabled standards, set EnableDefaultStandards to false .

       --control-finding-generator (string)
          This  field,  used when enabling Security Hub, specifies whether the
          calling account has consolidated control findings turned on. If  the
          value  for this field is set to SECURITY_CONTROL , Security Hub gen-
          erates a single finding for a control check even when the check  ap-
          plies to multiple enabled standards.

          If  the  value  for this field is set to STANDARD_CONTROL , Security
          Hub generates separate findings for a control check when  the  check
          applies to multiple enabled standards.

          The  value  for  this field in a member account matches the value in
          the administrator account. For accounts that aren't part of an orga-
          nization, the default value of this field is SECURITY_CONTROL if you
          enabled Security Hub on or after February 23, 2023.

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD_CONTROL

          o SECURITY_CONTROL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable AWS Security Hub

       The  following enable-security-hub example enables AWS Security Hub for
       the requesting account. It configures Security Hub to  enable  the  de-
       fault standards. For the hub resource, it assigns the value Security to
       the tag Department.

          aws securityhub enable-security-hub \
              --enable-default-standards \
              --tags '{"Department": "Security"}'

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see Enabling Security Hub in the AWS Security Hub
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
