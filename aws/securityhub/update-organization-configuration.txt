OPTIONS
       --auto-enable | --no-auto-enable (boolean)
          Whether to automatically enable Security Hub in new member  accounts
          when they join the organization.

          If  set  to true , then Security Hub is automatically enabled in new
          accounts. If set to false , then Security Hub isn't enabled  in  new
          accounts automatically. The default value is false .

          If  the  ConfigurationType  of your organization is set to CENTRAL ,
          then this field is set to false and can't be changed in the home Re-
          gion and linked Regions. However, in that case, the delegated admin-
          istrator can create a configuration policy in which Security Hub  is
          enabled and associate the policy with new organization accounts.

       --auto-enable-standards (string)
          Whether  to  automatically  enable Security Hub default standards in
          new member accounts when they join the organization.

          The default value of this parameter is equal to DEFAULT .

          If equal to DEFAULT , then Security Hub default standards are  auto-
          matically  enabled  for new member accounts. If equal to NONE , then
          default standards are not automatically enabled for new  member  ac-
          counts.

          If  the  ConfigurationType  of your organization is set to CENTRAL ,
          then this field is set to NONE and can't be changed in the home  Re-
          gion and linked Regions. However, in that case, the delegated admin-
          istrator can create a configuration policy in which  specific  secu-
          rity standards are enabled and associate the policy with new organi-
          zation accounts.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o DEFAULT

       --organization-configuration (structure)
          Provides information about the way an organization is configured  in
          Security Hub.

          ConfigurationType -> (string)
              Indicates whether the organization uses local or central config-
              uration.

              If you use local configuration, the Security Hub  delegated  ad-
              ministrator  can  set AutoEnable to true and AutoEnableStandards
              to DEFAULT . This automatically enables Security Hub and default
              security  standards  in new organization accounts. These new ac-
              count settings must be set separately in each  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices Region, and settings may be different in each Region.

              If  you  use  central configuration, the delegated administrator
              can create configuration policies. Configuration policies can be
              used to configure Security Hub, security standards, and security
              controls in multiple accounts and Regions. If you want new orga-
              nization  accounts to use a specific configuration, you can cre-
              ate a configuration policy and associate it  with  the  root  or
              specific  organizational  units (OUs). New accounts will inherit
              the policy from the root or their assigned OU.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes whether central configuration could be enabled as  the
              ConfigurationType  for  the  organization.  If  your  Configura-
              tionType is local configuration, then the value of Status is al-
              ways ENABLED .

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              Provides  an  explanation  if  the  value  of Status is equal to
              FAILED when ConfigurationType is equal to CENTRAL .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigurationType=string,Status=string,StatusMessage=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigurationType": "CENTRAL"|"LOCAL",
            "Status": "PENDING"|"ENABLED"|"FAILED",
            "StatusMessage": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
