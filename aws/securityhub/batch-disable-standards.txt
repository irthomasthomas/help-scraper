NAME
       batch-disable-standards -

DESCRIPTION
       Disables  the  standards  specified  by the provided StandardsSubscrip-
       tionArns .

       For more information, see Security Standards section  of  the  Security
       Hub User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-disable-standards
          --standards-subscription-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --standards-subscription-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the standards subscriptions to disable.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To disable a standard

       The following batch-disable-standards example disables the standard as-
       sociated with the specified subscription ARN.

          aws securityhub batch-disable-standards \
              --standards-subscription-arns "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"

       Output:

          {
              "StandardsSubscriptions": [
                  {
                      "StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:eu-central-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1",
                      "StandardsInput": { },
                      "StandardsStatus": "DELETING",
                      "StandardsSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StandardsSubscriptions -> (list)
          The details of the standards subscriptions that were disabled.

          (structure)
              A  resource  that  represents  your  subscription to a supported
              standard.

              StandardsSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource that represents your subscription to  a
                 supported standard.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              StandardsStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the standard subscription.

                 The status values are as follows:

                 o PENDING - Standard is in the process of being enabled.

                 o READY - Standard is enabled.

                 o INCOMPLETE - Standard could not be enabled completely. Some

                 o DELETING - Standard is in the process of being disabled.

                 o FAILED - Standard could not be disabled.

              StandardsStatusReason -> (structure)
                 The reason for the current status.

                 StatusReasonCode -> (string)
                     The reason code that represents the reason for  the  cur-
