GET-INSIGHTS()                                                  GET-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       get-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists and describes insights for the specified insight ARNs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-insights is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Insights

OPTIONS
       --insight-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the insights to describe. If you do not provide any  in-
          sight ARNs, then GetInsights returns all of your custom insights. It
          does not return any managed insights.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve details about an insight

       The  following get-insights example retrieves the configuration details
       for the insight with the specified ARN.

OUTPUT
       Insights -> (list)
          The insights returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a Security Hub insight.

              InsightArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a Security Hub insight.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of a Security Hub insight.

              Filters -> (structure)
                 One  or  more attributes used to filter the findings included
                 in the insight. The insight only includes findings that match
                 the criteria defined in the filters.

                 ProductArn -> (list)
                     The  ARN  generated by Security Hub that uniquely identi-
                     fies a third-party company (security  findings  provider)
                     after  this  provider's  product (solution that generates
                     findings) is registered with Security Hub.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 AwsAccountId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID that a finding is gen-
                     erated in.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 Id -> (list)
                     The  security findings provider-specific identifier for a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,

                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or

                 GeneratorId -> (list)
                     The identifier for  the  solution-specific  component  (a
                     discrete unit of logic) that generated a finding. In var-
                     ious security findings providers' solutions, this genera-
                     tor  can be called a rule, a check, a detector, a plugin,
                     etc.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-

                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 Region -> (list)
                     The Region from which the finding was generated.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a

                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 Confidence -> (list)
                     A finding's confidence.  Confidence  is  defined  as  the
                     likelihood  that  a finding accurately identifies the be-
                     havior or issue that it was intended to identify.

                     Confidence is scored on  a  0-100  basis  using  a  ratio
                     scale,  where  0  means  zero  percent confidence and 100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     The level of importance assigned to the resources associ-
                     ated with the finding.

                     A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have  no
                     criticality,  and a score of 100 is reserved for the most
                     critical resources.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub

                 Description -> (list)
                     A finding's description.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 RecommendationText -> (list)
                     The  recommendation  of  what  to  do about the issue de-
                     scribed in a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,

                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It

                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     A URL that links to a page about the current  finding  in
                     the security findings provider's solution.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ProductFields -> (list)
                     A data type where security findings providers can include
                     additional solution-specific details that aren't part  of
                     the defined AwsSecurityFinding format.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map filter provides the field to check for, the  value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to the key value when  fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample,  a  finding with a value of Security team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter  Department  EQUALS
                              Security  matches  findings  that have the value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS and EQUALS filters on the  same  field
                               are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                               matches any one of those filters. For  example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment CONTAINS Finance match a finding  that
                               includes  either  Security  , Finance , or both
                               values.

                            To search for values that don't  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use  NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the
                              ResourceTags  field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches findings that ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags   field,   the   filter    Department
                              NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings that dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field  are  joined  by  AND . A finding matches
                               only if it matches all of  those  filters.  For
                               example,  the  filters  Department NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS filters can only be  used  with  other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you  cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and   a
                            NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same field. Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ProductName -> (list)
                     The  name  of the solution (product) that generates find-
                     ings.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 CompanyName -> (list)
                     The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the
                     solution (product) that generates findings.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 UserDefinedFields -> (list)
                     A  list  of  name/value  string pairs associated with the
                     finding. These are custom, user-defined fields added to a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map filter provides the field to check for, the  value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to the key value when  fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample,  a  finding with a value of Security team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter  Department  EQUALS
                              Security  matches  findings  that have the value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS and EQUALS filters on the  same  field
                               are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                               matches any one of those filters. For  example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment CONTAINS Finance match a finding  that
                               includes  either  Security  , Finance , or both
                               values.

                            To search for values that don't  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use  NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the
                              ResourceTags  field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches findings that ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags   field,   the   filter    Department
                              NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings that dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field  are  joined  by  AND . A finding matches
                               only if it matches all of  those  filters.  For
                               example,  the  filters  Department NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS filters can only be  used  with  other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you  cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and   a
                            NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same field. Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 MalwareName -> (list)
                     The name of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-

                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a

                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                 MalwarePath -> (list)
                     The filesystem path of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 NetworkProtocol -> (list)
                     The protocol of network-related information about a find-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,

                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
                     The source media access control  (MAC)  address  of  net-
                     work-related information about a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,

                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter

                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the

                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a

                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                            field when querying for findings.

                        Gt -> (double)
                            The greater-than condition to be applied to a sin-
                            gle field when querying for findings.

                        Lt -> (double)
                            The less-than condition to be applied to a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
                     The  destination  domain  of  network-related information
                     about a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,

                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorType -> (list)
                     The type of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorValue -> (list)
                     The value of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-

                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorLastObservedAt -> (list)
                     A  timestamp  that  identifies  the last observation of a
                     threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that  provides  the end date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
                     The source of the threat intelligence.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)
                     The URL for more details from the source  of  the  threat
                     intelligence.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter

                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceType -> (list)
                     Specifies  the type of the resource that details are pro-
                     vided for.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource

                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                 ResourceId -> (list)
                     The canonical identifier for the given resource type.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches

                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR

                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 ResourcePartition -> (list)
                     The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the
                     Region is assigned to.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource

                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-

                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the

                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 ResourceTags -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a  re-
                     source at the time the finding was processed.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map filter provides the field to check for, the  value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to the key value when  fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample,  a  finding with a value of Security team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter  Department  EQUALS
                              Security  matches  findings  that have the value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS and EQUALS filters on the  same  field
                               are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                               matches any one of those filters. For  example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment CONTAINS Finance match a finding  that
                               includes  either  Security  , Finance , or both
                               values.

                            To search for values that don't  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use  NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the
                              ResourceTags  field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches findings that ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags   field,   the   filter    Department
                              NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings that dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field  are  joined  by  AND . A finding matches
                               only if it matches all of  those  filters.  For
                               example,  the  filters  Department NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS filters can only be  used  with  other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you  cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and   a
                            NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same field. Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
                     The instance type of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter

                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are

                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a

                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceVpcId -> (list)
                     The  identifier of the VPC that the instance was launched
                     in.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
                     The identifier  of  the  subnet  that  the  instance  was

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-

                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A

                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceLaunchedAt -> (list)
                     The date and time the instance was launched.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that provides the start date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the  end  date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
                     The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)
                     The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,

                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyUserName -> (list)
                     The  user associated with the IAM access key related to a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-

                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyStatus -> (list)
                     The status of the IAM access key related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyCreatedAt -> (list)
                     The creation date/time of the IAM access key related to a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that  provides  the end date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceAwsIamUserUserName -> (list)
                     The name of an IAM user.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceContainerName -> (list)
                     The name of the container related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used

                 ResourceContainerImageId -> (list)
                     The identifier of the image related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)

                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceContainerImageName -> (list)
                     The name of the image related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
                     A  timestamp  that  identifies  when  the  container  was
                     started.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that  provides  the end date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
                     The details of a resource that doesn't  have  a  specific
                     subfield for the resource type defined.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map filter provides the field to check for, the  value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to the key value when  fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample,  a  finding with a value of Security team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter  Department  EQUALS
                              Security  matches  findings  that have the value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS and EQUALS filters on the  same  field
                               are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                               matches any one of those filters. For  example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment CONTAINS Finance match a finding  that
                               includes  either  Security  , Finance , or both
                               values.

                            To search for values that don't  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use  NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the
                              ResourceTags  field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches findings that ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags   field,   the   filter    Department
                              NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings that dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field  are  joined  by  AND . A finding matches
                               only if it matches all of  those  filters.  For
                               example,  the  filters  Department NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS filters can only be  used  with  other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you  cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and   a
                            NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same field. Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ComplianceStatus -> (list)
                     Exclusive to findings that are generated as the result of
                     a check run against a specific rule in a supported  stan-
                     dard,  such  as CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Con-
                     tains security standard-related finding details.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 VerificationState -> (list)
                     The veracity of a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter

                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-

                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a

                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 WorkflowState -> (list)
                     The workflow state of a finding.

                     Note that this field is deprecated. To search for a find-
                     ing based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 WorkflowStatus -> (list)
                     The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed
                     values are the following.

                     o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it is  re-
                       viewed.  Security  Hub  also resets the workflow status
                       from NOTIFIED or  RESOLVED  to  NEW  in  the  following
                       cases:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to either WARN-
                         ING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner  has  been
                       notified  about  the security issue. Used when the ini-
                       tial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs  in-
                       tervention  from the resource owner. If one of the fol-
                       lowing occurs, the workflow status is changed automati-
                       cally from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you  reviewed  the  finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The work-
                       flow status of a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if
                       RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                     o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and
                       is now considered resolved.  The  finding  remains  RE-
                       SOLVED unless one of the following occurs:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     In those cases, the workflow status is automatically  re-
                     set to NEW .

                     For  findings  from  controls,  if  Compliance.Status  is
                     PASSED , then Security Hub automatically sets  the  work-
                     flow status to RESOLVED .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 RecordState -> (list)
                     The updated record state for the finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource

                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 NoteText -> (list)
                     The text of a note.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
                     The principal that created a note.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub

                     The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence.
                     Confidence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding
                     accurately  identifies  the behavior or issue that it was
                     intended to identify.

                     Confidence is scored on  a  0-100  basis  using  a  ratio
                     scale,  where  0  means  zero  percent confidence and 100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN of the solution that generated a related  finding
                     that is identified by the finding provider.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                 FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
                     The finding provider value for the severity label.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string

                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or

                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 FindingProviderFieldsSeverityOriginal -> (list)
                     The finding provider's original value for the severity.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 FindingProviderFieldsTypes -> (list)
                     One  or  more finding types that the finding provider as-
                     signed to the finding. Uses the format of namespace/cate-
                     gory/classifier that classify a finding.

                     Valid  namespace  values  are: Software and Configuration
                     Checks | TTPs | Effects | Unusual Behaviors  |  Sensitive
                     Data Identifications

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-

                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter

                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a

                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                 Sample -> (list)
                     Indicates  whether or not sample findings are included in
                     the filter results.

                     (structure)
                        Boolean filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (boolean)
                            The value of the boolean.

                 ComplianceSecurityControlId -> (list)
                     The unique identifier of a control across standards. Val-
                     ues  for  this  field  typically consist of an Amazon Web
                     Service and a number, such as APIGateway.5.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                 ComplianceAssociatedStandardsId -> (list)
                     The unique identifier of a standard in which a control is
                     enabled.  This  field consists of the resource portion of
                     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) returned for a standard in
                     the DescribeStandards API response.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter

                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a

                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 VulnerabilitiesFixAvailable -> (list)
                     Indicates whether a vulnerability is  fixed  in  a  newer
                     version of the affected software packages. You can filter
                     findings by this field only if you use Security  Hub  and
                     Amazon Inspector.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter

                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter

                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a

                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and

                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ComplianceSecurityControlParametersValue -> (list)
                     The current value of a security control parameter.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

              GroupByAttribute -> (string)
                 The  grouping attribute for the insight's findings. Indicates
                 how to group the matching findings, and identifies  the  type
                 of  item  that the insight applies to. For example, if an in-
                 sight is grouped by resource  identifier,  then  the  insight
                 produces a list of resource identifiers.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to request the next page of results.
