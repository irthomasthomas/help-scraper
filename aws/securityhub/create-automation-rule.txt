OPTIONS
       --tags (map)
          User-defined tags that help you label the purpose of a rule.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --rule-status (string)
          Whether the rule is active after it is created. If this parameter is
          equal to ENABLED , Security Hub starts applying the rule to findings
          and  finding  updates after the rule is created. To change the value
          of this parameter after creating a rule,  use  `  BatchUpdateAutoma-
          tionRules
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateAutomationRules.html`__
          .

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --rule-order (integer)
          An integer ranging from 1 to 1000 that represents the order in which
          the rule action is applied to findings. Security Hub  applies  rules
          with lower values for this parameter first.

       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --description (string)
          A description of the rule.

       --is-terminal | --no-is-terminal (boolean)
          Specifies whether a rule is the last to be applied with respect to a
          finding that matches the rule criteria. This is useful when a  find-
          ing  matches the criteria for multiple rules, and each rule has dif-
          ferent actions. If a rule is terminal, Security Hub applies the rule
          action to a finding that matches the rule criteria and doesn't eval-
          uate other rules for the finding. By default, a rule isn't terminal.

       --criteria (structure)
          A set of ASFF finding field attributes  and  corresponding  expected
          values  that  Security Hub uses to filter findings. If a rule is en-
          abled and a finding matches the conditions specified in this parame-
          ter, Security Hub applies the rule action to the finding.

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) for a third-party product that
              generated a finding in Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID in which a finding was gener-
              ated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding

                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only

                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Id -> (list)
              The product-specific identifier for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          GeneratorId -> (list)
              The identifier for the solution-specific component  that  gener-
              ated a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Type -> (list)
              One or more finding  types  in  the  format  of  namespace/cate-
              gory/classifier  that  classify  a  finding. For a list of name-
              spaces, classifiers, and categories, see Types taxonomy for ASFF
              in the Security Hub User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FirstObservedAt -> (list)
              A timestamp that indicates when  the  potential  security  issue
              captured  by  a finding was first observed by the security find-
              ings product.

              Uses the date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section 5.6, In-
              ternet  Date/Time  Format . The value cannot contain spaces. For
              example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the start  date  for  the  date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the end date for the date  fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 DateRange -> (structure)

          Confidence -> (list)
              The likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the behavior
              or issue that it was intended to identify. Confidence is  scored
              on  a  0100 basis using a ratio scale. A value of 0 means 0 per-
              cent confidence, and a value of 100  means  100  percent  confi-
              dence.  For  example,  a  data exfiltration detection based on a
              statistical deviation of network traffic has low confidence  be-
              cause  an actual exfiltration hasn't been verified. For more in-
              formation, see Confidence in the Security Hub User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The  level  of importance that is assigned to the resources that
              are associated with a finding. Criticality is scored on  a  0100
              basis,  using  a ratio scale that supports only full integers. A
              score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no critical-
              ity,  and  a  score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources. For more information, see Criticality in  the  Security
              Hub User Guide .

                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Description -> (list)
              A finding's description.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              Provides a URL that links to a page about the current finding in
              the finding product.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub

                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProductName -> (list)
              Provides the name of the product that generated the finding. For
              control-based findings, the product name is Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the company for the product that generated the find-

                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with

                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          SeverityLabel -> (list)
              The severity value of the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceType -> (list)
              The type of resource that the finding pertains to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceId -> (list)
              The  identifier for the given resource type. For Amazon Web Ser-
              vices resources that are identified  by  Amazon  Resource  Names
              (ARNs),  this is the ARN. For Amazon Web Services resources that
              lack ARNs, this is the identifier as defined by the  Amazon  Web
              Service  that  created the resource. For non-Amazon Web Services
              resources, this is a unique identifier that is  associated  with
              the resource.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The partition in which the resource that the finding pertains to
              is  located.  A  partition is a group of Amazon Web Services Re-
              gions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one  parti-
              tion.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services Region where the resource that a finding
              pertains to is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion

                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              Custom  fields and values about the resource that a finding per-
              tains to.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for filtering Security Hub  findings.  Each  map
                 filter  provides  the  field to check for, the value to check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to the key value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter  Department  CONTAINS  Security matches findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                       field, the filter Department  EQUALS  Security  matches
                       findings  that  have the value Security for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS and EQUALS filters  on  the  same  field  are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of those filters. For example, the filters  Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To  search  for  values that don't have the filter value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  find-
                       ings  that  dont have the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same  field
                        are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department   NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND  Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS Finance match  a  finding  that  excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS  filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
                        filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only  be  used  with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly, you cant  have  both
                     an  EQUALS  filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              The result of a security check. This  field  is  only  used  for
              findings generated from controls.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceSecurityControlId -> (list)
              The security control ID for which a finding was generated. Secu-
              rity control IDs are the same across standards.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceAssociatedStandardsId -> (list)
              The unique identifier of a standard in which a  control  is  en-
              abled. This field consists of the resource portion of the Amazon
              Resource  Name  (ARN)   returned   for   a   standard   in   the
              DescribeStandards API response.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub

                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          VerificationState -> (list)
              Provides the veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RecordState -> (list)
              Provides the current state of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN for the product that generated a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

          RelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The product-generated identifier for a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NoteText -> (list)
              The text of a user-defined note that's added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The  timestamp  of when the note was updated. Uses the date-time
              format specified in RFC 3339  section  5.6,  Internet  Date/Time
              Format   .   The  value  cannot  contain  spaces.  For  example,
              2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the start  date  for  the  date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the end date for the date  fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          UserDefinedFields -> (list)
              A  list  of  user-defined name and value string pairs added to a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for filtering Security Hub  findings.  Each  map
                 filter  provides  the  field to check for, the value to check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to the key value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter  Department  CONTAINS  Security matches findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                       field, the filter Department  EQUALS  Security  matches
                       findings  that  have the value Security for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS and EQUALS filters  on  the  same  field  are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of those filters. For example, the filters  Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To  search  for  values that don't have the filter value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  find-
                       ings  that  dont have the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same  field
                        are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department   NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND  Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS Finance match  a  finding  that  excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS  filters can only be used with other CONTAINS
                        filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only  be  used  with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly, you cant  have  both
                     an  EQUALS  filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

       --actions (list)
          One or more actions to update finding fields if  a  finding  matches
          the conditions specified in Criteria .

          (structure)
              One  or  more  actions  to  update  finding  fields if a finding
              matches the defined criteria of the rule.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies that the rule action should update the Types  find-
                 ing field. The Types finding field classifies findings in the
                 format of namespace/category/classifier.  For  more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Types  taxonomy for ASFF in the Security Hub User
                 Guide .

                     Normalized -> (integer)
                        The  normalized  severity for the finding. This attri-
                        bute is to be deprecated in favor of Label .

                        If you provide Normalized and do not provide  Label  ,
                        Label is set automatically as follows.

                        o 0 - INFORMATIONAL

                        o 139 - LOW

                     Label -> (string)
                        The  severity value of the finding. The allowed values
                        are the following.

                        o INFORMATIONAL - No issue was found.

                        o LOW - The issue does not require action on its own.

                        o MEDIUM - The issue must be  addressed  but  not  ur-
                          gently.

                        o HIGH - The issue must be addressed as a priority.

                        o CRITICAL  - The issue must be remediated immediately
                          to avoid it escalating.

                 VerificationState -> (string)

                 Criticality -> (integer)
                     The rule action updates the Criticality field of a  find-
                     ing.

                 Types -> (list)
                     The rule action updates the Types field of a finding.

                     (string)

                 UserDefinedFields -> (map)

                     Status -> (string)
                        The  status of the investigation into the finding. The
                        workflow status is specific to an individual  finding.
                        It does not affect the generation of new findings. For
                        example, setting the workflow status to SUPPRESSED  or
                        RESOLVED  does  not prevent a new finding for the same
                        issue.

                        The allowed values are the following.

                        o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before  it  is
                          reviewed.  Security  Hub  also resets WorkFlowStatus
                          from NOTIFIED or RESOLVED to NEW  in  the  following
                          cases:

                          o The record state changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                          o The  compliance  status changes from PASSED to ei-
                            ther WARNING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                        o NOTIFIED - Indicates that you notified the  resource
                          owner  about  the security issue. Used when the ini-
                          tial reviewer is not the resource owner,  and  needs
                          intervention from the resource owner.

                        o RESOLVED  -  The finding was reviewed and remediated
                          and is now considered resolved.

                        o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the finding
                          and  do  not  believe that any action is needed. The
                          finding is no longer updated.

                 RelatedFindings -> (list)
                     The rule action updates the RelatedFindings  field  of  a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        Details about a related finding.

                        ProductArn -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the product that generated a related
                            finding.

                        Id -> (string)
                            The product-generated  identifier  for  a  related
                            finding.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an automation rule

       The following create-automation-rule example creates an automation rule
       in the current AWS account and AWS Region. Security  Hub  filters  your
       findings  based  on  the  specified criteria and applies the actions to
       matching findings. Only the Security Hub administrator account can  run
       this command.

          aws securityhub create-automation-rule \
              --actions '[{ \
                  "Type": "FINDING_FIELDS_UPDATE", \
