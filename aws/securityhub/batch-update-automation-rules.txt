OPTIONS
       --update-automation-rules-request-items (list)
          An array of ARNs for the rules that are to be  updated.  Optionally,
          you can also include RuleStatus and RuleOrder .

          (structure)
              Specifies  the  parameters  to  update in an existing automation
              rule.

              RuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the rule.

              RuleStatus -> (string)
                 Whether the rule is active after it is created. If  this  pa-
                 rameter  is  equal  to ENABLED , Security Hub starts applying
                 the rule to findings and finding updates after  the  rule  is
                 created. To change the value of this parameter after creating
                 a      rule,      use      `       BatchUpdateAutomationRules
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateAutomationRules.html`__
                 .

              RuleOrder -> (integer)
                 An integer ranging from 1 to 1000 that represents  the  order
                 in which the rule action is applied to findings. Security Hub
                 applies rules with lower values for this parameter first.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the rule.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              IsTerminal -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a rule is the last to be applied  with  re-
                 spect  to  a  finding that matches the rule criteria. This is
                 useful when a  finding  matches  the  criteria  for  multiple
                 rules,  and  each rule has different actions. If the value of
                 this field is set to true for a rule,  Security  Hub  applies
                 the  rule  action to a finding that matches the rule criteria
                 and doesn't evaluate other rules for the finding. The default
                 value of this field is false .

              Criteria -> (structure)
                 A  set of ASFF finding field attributes and corresponding ex-
                 pected values that Security Hub uses to filter findings. If a
                 rule  is  enabled and a finding matches the conditions speci-
                 fied in this parameter, Security Hub applies the rule  action
                 to the finding.

                 ProductArn -> (list)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a third-party product
                     that generated a finding in Security Hub.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 AwsAccountId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID in which a finding was
                     generated.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-

                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-

                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Id -> (list)
                     The product-specific identifier for a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 GeneratorId -> (list)
                     The  identifier  for the solution-specific component that
                     generated a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Type -> (list)
                     One or more finding types in the format of namespace/cat-
                     egory/classifier  that  classify a finding. For a list of

                 FirstObservedAt -> (list)
                     A  timestamp  that  indicates when the potential security
                     issue captured by a finding was first observed by the se-
                     curity findings product.

                     Uses  the  date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section
                     5.6, Internet Date/Time Format . The value cannot contain
                     spaces. For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that provides the start date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 Confidence -> (list)
                     The  likelihood  that a finding accurately identifies the
                     behavior or issue that it was intended to identify.  Con-
                     fidence  is scored on a 0100 basis using a ratio scale. A
                     value of 0 means 0 percent confidence, and a value of 100
                     means  100 percent confidence. For example, a data exfil-
                     tration detection based on  a  statistical  deviation  of
                     network  traffic has low confidence because an actual ex-
                     filtration hasn't been verified.  For  more  information,

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Criticality -> (list)
                     The level of importance that is assigned to the resources
                     that are associated with a finding. Criticality is scored
                     on a 0100 basis, using a ratio scale that  supports  only
                     full integers. A score of 0 means that the underlying re-
                     sources have no criticality, and a score of  100  is  re-
                     served for the most critical resources. For more informa-
                     tion, see Criticality in the Security Hub User Guide .

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The greater-than-equal condition to be applied  to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Title -> (list)
                     A finding's title.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Description -> (list)
                     A finding's description.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 SourceUrl -> (list)
                     Provides  a  URL  that  links to a page about the current
                     finding in the finding product.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-

                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,

                              matches findings that have a resource type other

                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 SeverityLabel -> (list)
                     The severity value of the finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                     unique identifier that is associated with the resource.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourcePartition -> (list)
                     The partition in which the resource that the finding per-
                     tains to is located. A partition is a group of Amazon Web
                     Services Regions. Each Amazon  Web  Services  account  is
                     scoped to one partition.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-

                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceTags -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a  re-
                     source at the time the finding was processed.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches findings that do not have  the  value  Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
                     Custom fields and values about the resource that a  find-
                     ing pertains to.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches findings that do not have  the  value  Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ComplianceStatus -> (list)
                     The result of a security check. This field is  only  used
                     for findings generated from controls.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ComplianceSecurityControlId -> (list)
                     The  security  control  ID for which a finding was gener-
                     ated. Security control IDs are the same across standards.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ComplianceAssociatedStandardsId -> (list)
                     The unique identifier of a standard in which a control is
                     enabled.  This  field consists of the resource portion of
                     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) returned for a standard in
                     the DescribeStandards API response.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-

                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that

                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RecordState -> (list)
                     Provides the current state of a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN for the product that generated a related finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-

                               any one of those filters.

                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NoteText -> (list)
                     The text of a user-defined note that's added to  a  find-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
                     The  timestamp  of  when  the  note was updated. Uses the
                     date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section  5.6,  In-
                     ternet  Date/Time  Format . The value cannot contain spa-
                     ces. For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that  provides  the end date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
                     The principal that created a note.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-

                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 UserDefinedFields -> (list)
                     A list of user-defined name and value string pairs  added
                     to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches findings that do not have  the  value  Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

              Actions -> (list)

                            UpdatedBy -> (string)
                               The principal that updated the note.

                        Severity -> (structure)
                            Updates to the severity information for a finding.

                            Normalized -> (integer)
                               The  normalized  severity for the finding. This
                               attribute is to be deprecated in favor of Label
                               .

                               If  you  provide  Normalized and do not provide
                               Label , Label is set automatically as follows.

                               o CRITICAL - The issue must be remediated imme-
                                 diately to avoid it escalating.

                        VerificationState -> (string)
                            The  rule  action  updates  the  VerificationState
                            field of a finding.

                        Confidence -> (integer)

                            ing.

                            (string)

                        UserDefinedFields -> (map)
                            The  rule  action  updates  the  UserDefinedFields
                            field of a finding.

                               dividual finding. It does not affect the gener-
                               ation of new findings. For example, setting the
                               workflow  status to SUPPRESSED or RESOLVED does
                               not prevent a new finding for the same issue.

                               The allowed values are the following.

                               o NEW - The initial state of a finding,  before
                                 it  is  reviewed.  Security  Hub  also resets

                                 NEW in the following cases:

                                 o The  record  state changes from ARCHIVED to
                                   ACTIVE .

                                 o The compliance status changes  from  PASSED
                                   to  either WARNING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAIL-
                                   ABLE .

                               o NOTIFIED - Indicates that  you  notified  the
                                 resource owner about the security issue. Used
                                 when the initial reviewer is not the resource
                                 owner,  and  needs  intervention from the re-
                                 source owner.

                               o RESOLVED - The finding was reviewed and reme-
                                 diated and is now considered resolved.

                               o SUPPRESSED  - Indicates that you reviewed the
                                 finding and do not believe that any action is
                                 needed. The finding is no longer updated.

                        RelatedFindings -> (list)
                            The  rule action updates the RelatedFindings field
                            of a finding.

                            (structure)
                               Details about a related finding.

                               ProductArn -> (string)
                                   The ARN of the product that generated a re-
                                   lated finding.

                               Id -> (string)
                                   The  product-generated identifier for a re-
                                   lated finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
