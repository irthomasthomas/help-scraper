OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A  token  to specify where to start paginating the response. This is
          the NextToken from a previously truncated response.  On  your  first
          call to the ListAutomationRules API, set the value of this parameter
          to NULL .

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of rules to return in  the  response.  This  cur-
          rently ranges from 1 to 100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a list of automation rules

       The  following list-automation-rules example lists the automation rules
       for an AWS account. Only the Security Hub administrator account can run
       this command.

          aws securityhub list-automation-rules \
              --max-results 3 \
              --next-token NULL

OUTPUT
       AutomationRulesMetadata -> (list)
          Metadata for rules in the calling  account.  The  response  includes
          rules with a RuleStatus of ENABLED and DISABLED .

          (structure)
              Metadata  for  automation  rules in the calling account. The re-
              sponse includes rules with a RuleStatus of ENABLED and  DISABLED
              .

              RuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the rule.

              RuleStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule is active after it is created. If this pa-
                 rameter is equal to ENABLED , Security  Hub  starts  applying
                 the  rule  to  findings and finding updates after the rule is
                 created. To change the value of this parameter after creating
                 a       rule,      use      `      BatchUpdateAutomationRules
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateAutomationRules.html`__
                 .

              RuleOrder -> (integer)
                 An  integer  ranging from 1 to 1000 that represents the order
                 in which the rule action is applied to findings. Security Hub
                 applies rules with lower values for this parameter first.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the rule.

              IsTerminal -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether  a rule is the last to be applied with re-
                 spect to a finding that matches the rule  criteria.  This  is
                 useful  when  a  finding  matches  the  criteria for multiple
                 rules, and each rule has different actions. If a rule is ter-
                 minal, Security Hub applies the rule action to a finding that
                 matches the rule criteria and doesn't  evaluate  other  rules
                 for the finding. By default, a rule isn't terminal.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that indicates when the rule was created.

                 Uses  the date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section 5.6,
                 Internet Date/Time Format . The value cannot contain  spaces.
                 For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that  indicates when the rule was most recently
                 updated.

                 Uses the date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section  5.6,
                 Internet  Date/Time Format . The value cannot contain spaces.
                 For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

              CreatedBy -> (string)
                 The principal that created a rule.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token for the response.
