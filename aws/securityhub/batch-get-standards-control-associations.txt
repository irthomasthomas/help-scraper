OPTIONS
       --standards-control-association-ids (list)
          An array with one or more objects that includes a  security  control
          (identified  with  SecurityControlId , SecurityControlArn , or a mix
          of both parameters) and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  a  stan-
          dard. This field is used to query the enablement status of a control
          in a specified standard. The security control ID or ARN is the  same
          across standards.

          (structure)
              An  array with one or more objects that includes a security con-
              trol (identified with SecurityControlId ,  SecurityControlArn  ,
              or  a mix of both parameters) and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
              of a standard. The security control ID or ARN is the same across
              standards.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 The  unique  identifier  (identified with SecurityControlId ,
                 SecurityControlArn , or a mix of both parameters) of a  secu-
                 rity control across standards.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SecurityControlId=string,StandardsArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "SecurityControlId": "string",
              "StandardsArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the enablement status of a control

       The following batch-get-standards-control-associations example  identi-
       fies  whether the specified controls are enabled in the specified stan-
       dards.

              UpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the enablement status of the control in the
                 specified standard was last updated.

              UpdatedReason -> (string)
                 The reason for updating the enablement status of a control in
                 a specified standard.

              StandardsControlDescription -> (string)
                 The description of a control. This typically  summarizes  how
                 Security  Hub  evaluates the control and the conditions under
                 which it produces a failed finding. This parameter may refer-

              Provides   details   about  which  control's  enablement  status
              couldn't be retrieved  in  a  specified  standard  when  calling
              BatchUpdateStandardsControlAssociations  .  This  parameter also
