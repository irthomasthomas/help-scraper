OPTIONS
       --region-linking-mode (string)
          Indicates  whether  to  aggregate findings from all of the available
          Regions in the current partition. Also determines whether  to  auto-
          matically  aggregate  findings from new Regions as Security Hub sup-
          ports them and you opt into them.

          The selected option also determines how to use the Regions  provided
          in the Regions list.

          The options are as follows:

          o ALL_REGIONS  - Indicates to aggregate findings from all of the Re-
            gions where Security Hub is enabled. When you choose this  option,
            Security  Hub  also automatically aggregates findings from new Re-
            gions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.

          o ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED -  Indicates  to  aggregate  findings
            from  all of the Regions where Security Hub is enabled, except for
            the Regions listed in the Regions parameter. When you choose  this
            option,  Security  Hub also automatically aggregates findings from
            new Regions as Security Hub supports them and you opt into them.

          o SPECIFIED_REGIONS - Indicates to aggregate findings only from  the
            Regions listed in the Regions parameter. Security Hub does not au-
            tomatically aggregate findings from new Regions.

       --regions (list)
          If RegionLinkingMode is ALL_REGIONS_EXCEPT_SPECIFIED , then this  is
          a  space-separated list of Regions that do not aggregate findings to
          the aggregation Region.

          If  RegionLinkingMode  is  SPECIFIED_REGIONS  ,  then  this   is   a
          space-separated  list  of  Regions that do aggregate findings to the
          aggregation Region.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable finding aggregation

       The following create-finding-aggregator example configures finding  ag-
       gregation.  It is run from US East (Virginia), which designates US East
       (Virginia) as the aggregation Region. It indicates to only link  speci-
       fied  Regions, and to not automatically link new Regions. It selects US
       West (N. California) and US West (Oregon) as the linked Regions.

          aws securityhub create-finding-aggregator \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --region-linking-mode SPECIFIED_REGIONS \
              --regions us-west-1,us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "FindingAggregatorArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-east-1:222222222222:finding-aggregator/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000",
              "FindingAggregationRegion": "us-east-1",
              "RegionLinkingMode": "SPECIFIED_REGIONS",
              "Regions": "us-west-1,us-west-2"
          }

       rity Hub User Guide.

OUTPUT
       FindingAggregatorArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the finding aggregator. You use the finding aggregator
          ARN to retrieve details for, update, and stop finding aggregation.

          The aggregation Region.

       RegionLinkingMode -> (string)
          Indicates whether to link all Regions, all Regions except for a list
          of excluded Regions, or a list of included Regions.

       Regions -> (list)
          The list of excluded Regions or included Regions.

          (string)
