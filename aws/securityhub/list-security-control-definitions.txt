NAME
       list-security-control-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of the security controls that apply to a specified standard.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-security-control-definitions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: SecurityControlDefinitions

OPTIONS
       --standards-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the standard that you want to view
          controls for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       SecurityControlDefinitions -> (list)
          An array of controls that apply to the specified standard.

          (structure)
              Provides  metadata  for a security control, including its unique
              standard-agnostic  identifier,  title,  description,   severity,
              availability in Amazon Web Services Regions, and a link to reme-
              diation steps.

              SecurityControlId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of a security control across standards.
                 Values for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Ser-
                 vice name and a number (for example, APIGateway.3). This  pa-
                 rameter  differs  from SecurityControlArn , which is a unique
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to  a  control.  The  ARN
                 references  the security control ID (for example, arn:aws:se-
                 curityhub:eu-central-1:123456789012:security-control/APIGate-
                 way.3).

              Title -> (string)
                 The title of a security control.

              Description -> (string)
                 The  description of a security control across standards. This
                 typically summarizes how Security Hub evaluates  the  control
                 and  the conditions under which it produces a failed finding.
                 This parameter doesn't reference a specific standard.

              RemediationUrl -> (string)
                 A link to Security Hub documentation that explains how to re-
                 mediate a failed finding for a security control.

              SeverityRating -> (string)
                 The  severity  of  a  security  control. For more information
                 about how  Security  Hub  determines  control  severity,  see
                 Assigning  severity  to  control findings in the Security Hub
                 User Guide .

              CurrentRegionAvailability -> (string)
                 Specifies whether a security control is available in the cur-
                 rent Amazon Web Services Region.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  pagination  parameter  that's included in the response only if it
          was included in the request.
