OPTIONS
       --insight-arn (string)
          The ARN of the insight that you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The updated name for the insight.

       --filters (structure)
          The updated filters that define this insight.

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The Amazon Web Services account ID in which a finding is  gener-
              ated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have

                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.

                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the

                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-

                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          GeneratorId -> (list)
              The identifier for the solution-specific component  (a  discrete
              unit  of  logic)  that  generated a finding. In various security
              findings providers' solutions, this generator can  be  called  a
              rule, a check, a detector, a plugin, etc.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Type -> (list)
              A  finding  type  in the format of namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with

                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Confidence -> (list)
              A finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the  likelihood
              that  a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

                 Gt -> (double)
                     The  greater-than  condition  to  be  applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Lt -> (double)
                     The less-than condition to be applied to a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The  level  of  importance  assigned to the resources associated
              with the finding.

              A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no  criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

                 Lt -> (double)
                     The less-than condition to be applied to a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Description -> (list)
              A finding's description.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A  URL that links to a page about the current finding in the se-
              curity findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A  data type where security findings providers can include addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the  solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          UserDefinedFields -> (list)
              A list of name/value string pairs associated with  the  finding.
              These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          MalwareType -> (list)
              The type of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

          MalwarePath -> (list)
              The filesystem path of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-

                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates  the  direction  of  network traffic associated with a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

          NetworkProtocol -> (list)
              The protocol of network-related information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single

                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

                 Gt -> (double)

                     field when querying for findings.

                 Lt -> (double)

          NetworkSourceDomain -> (list)
              The  source  domain of network-related information about a find-
              ing.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have

                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProcessName -> (list)
              The name of the process.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ProcessPath -> (list)
              The path to the process executable.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)

          ThreatIntelIndicatorType -> (list)
              The type of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ThreatIntelIndicatorValue -> (list)
              The value of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub

          ThreatIntelIndicatorCategory -> (list)
              The category of a threat intelligence indicator.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ThreatIntelIndicatorLastObservedAt -> (list)

                 Start -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the start  date  for  the  date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the end date for the date  fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't

                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other

                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceType -> (list)
              Specifies  the  type  of  the resource that details are provided
              for.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceId -> (list)
              The canonical identifier for the given resource type.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering

                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other

                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services  external  Region  name  where
              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIpV4Addresses -> (list)
              The IPv4 addresses associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 The IP filter for querying findings.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     A finding's CIDR value.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIpV6Addresses -> (list)
              The IPv6 addresses associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 The IP filter for querying findings.

                 Cidr -> (string)
                     A finding's CIDR value.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceKeyName -> (list)
              The key name associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIamInstanceProfileArn -> (list)
              The IAM profile ARN of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceVpcId -> (list)
              The identifier of the VPC that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceLaunchedAt -> (list)
              The date and time the instance was launched.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A  timestamp  that  provides  the start date for the date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time
                     should be separated by T . For more information, see  RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A  timestamp that provides the end date for the date fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)
              The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyStatus -> (list)
              The status of the IAM access key related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyCreatedAt -> (list)
              The creation date/time of the IAM access key related to a  find-
              ing.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A  timestamp  that  provides  the start date for the date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time
                     should be separated by T . For more information, see  RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A  timestamp that provides the end date for the date fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time
                     should be separated by T . For more information, see  RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsIamUserUserName -> (list)
              The name of an IAM user.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceContainerName -> (list)
              The name of the container related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceContainerImageId -> (list)
              The identifier of the image related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide

                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only

          ResourceContainerImageName -> (list)
              The name of the image related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              A timestamp that identifies when the container was started.

              A  correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The
              value cannot contain spaces, and date and time should  be  sepa-
              rated by T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section 5.6, In-
              ternet Date/Time Format .

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the start  date  for  the  date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A timestamp that provides the end date for the date  fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     . The value cannot contain  spaces,  and  date  and  time
                     should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map  filter  for filtering Security Hub findings. Each map
                 filter provides the field to check for, the  value  to  check
                 for, and the comparison operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key  value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                       filter Department CONTAINS  Security  matches  findings
                       that include the value Security for the Department tag.
                       In the same example, a finding with a value of Security
                       team for the Department tag is a match.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, for  the  ResourceTags
                       field,  the  filter  Department EQUALS Security matches
                       findings that have the value Security for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        CONTAINS  and  EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                        joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one
                        of  those filters. For example, the filters Department
                        CONTAINS Security OR Department CONTAINS Finance match
                        a finding that includes either Security , Finance , or
                        both values.

                     To search for values that don't have  the  filter  value,
                     use one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the ResourceTags field,
                       the  filter  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches
                       findings that exclude the value Finance for the Depart-
                       ment tag.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the  ResourceTags  field,
                       the  filter Department NOT_EQUALS Finance matches find-
                       ings that dont have the value Finance for  the  Depart-
                       ment tag.
                        NOT_CONTAINS  and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field
                        are joined by AND .  A  finding  matches  only  if  it
                        matches all of those filters. For example, the filters
                        Department  NOT_CONTAINS   Security   AND   Department
                        NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  match  a  finding that excludes
                        both the Security and Finance values.

                        CONTAINS filters can only be used with other  CONTAINS
                        filters.  NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can only be used with
                        other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the same field. Similarly, you cant have both
                     an EQUALS filter and a  NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same
                     field. Combining filters in this way returns an error.
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The status of the investigation into a finding.  Allowed  values
              are the following.

              o NEW  -  The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed.
                Security Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED  or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED to either WARNING ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about  the  security  issue. Used when the initial reviewer is
                not the resource owner, and needs intervention  from  the  re-
                source  owner.  If  one  of the following occurs, the workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING  ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED  -  Indicates  that you reviewed the finding and do
                not believe that any action is needed. The workflow status  of
                a  SUPPRESSED  finding  does not change if RecordState changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is  now
                considered  resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING  ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In  those  cases,  the workflow status is automatically reset to
              NEW .

              For findings from controls, if  Compliance.Status  is  PASSED  ,
              then  Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to RE-
              SOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RecordState -> (list)
              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

          RelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The solution-generated identifier for a related finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide

                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub

                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The timestamp of when the note was updated.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A  timestamp  that  provides  the start date for the date
                     filter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time
                     should be separated by T . For more information, see  RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 End -> (string)
                     A  timestamp that provides the end date for the date fil-
                     ter.

                     A correctly formatted example is 2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z
                     .  The  value  cannot  contain  spaces, and date and time
                     should be separated by T . For more information, see  RFC
                     3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A keyword filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value for the keyword.

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the  finding  confidence.  Confi-
              dence  is  defined  as  the likelihood that a finding accurately
              identifies the behavior or issue that it was intended  to  iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gt -> (double)
                     The greater-than condition to  be  applied  to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Lt -> (double)
                     The  less-than  condition to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the level of importance  assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

              The finding identifier of a related finding that  is  identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding that is
              identified by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the severity label.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-

                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see

                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          FindingProviderFieldsTypes -> (list)
              One or more finding types that the finding provider assigned  to
              the  finding.  Uses  the format of namespace/category/classifier
              that classify a finding.

              Valid namespace values are: Software and Configuration Checks  |

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceAssociatedStandardsId -> (list)
              The  unique  identifier  of a standard in which a control is en-
              abled. This field consists of the resource portion of the Amazon
              Resource   Name   (ARN)   returned   for   a   standard  in  the
              DescribeStandards API response.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          VulnerabilitiesExploitAvailable -> (list)
              Indicates  whether  a software vulnerability in your environment
              has a known exploit. You can filter findings by this field  only
              if you use Security Hub and Amazon Inspector.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

          VulnerabilitiesFixAvailable -> (list)
              Indicates whether a vulnerability is fixed in a newer version of
              the  affected software packages. You can filter findings by this
              field only if you use Security Hub and Amazon Inspector.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one

                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with

                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceSecurityControlParametersName -> (list)
              The name of a security control parameter.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ComplianceSecurityControlParametersValue -> (list)
              The current value of a security control parameter.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding

          AwsAccountName -> (list)
              The  name  of the Amazon Web Services account in which a finding
              is generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-

                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with

                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-

                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide
                     both   an   EQUALS   filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.  Combining  fil-
                     ters  in  this way returns an error. CONTAINS filters can
                     only be used with other  CONTAINS  filters.  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for  the  following  filters,  Security  Hub
                     first  identifies  findings that have resource types that
                     start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2  .  It  then  excludes
                     findings  that  have  a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS  and  NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceApplicationName -> (list)
              The name of the application that is related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string value  when  filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To  search for values that have the filter value, use one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS  .  For  example,  the  filter  Title CONTAINS
                       CloudFront matches findings that have a Title that  in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter  AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX  .  For  example, the filter ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX us matches findings that have  a  ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a different value, such as af , ap , or  ca  ,  doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS  ,  and PREFIX filters on the same
                        field are joined by OR  .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                        matches  any  one  of  those filters. For example, the
                        filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront  OR  Title  CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the filter  Title  NOT_CON-
                       TAINS  CloudFront  matches  findings  that have a Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values other than the filter  value,  use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To  search  for values that don't start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceRegion  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches findings
                       with a ResourceRegion that starts with  a  value  other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters on the same field are joined by AND .  A  finding
                        matches  only  if it matches all of those filters. For
                        example, the filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND
                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You cant have both a CONTAINS filter and  a  NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter  on  the  same field. Similarly, you can't provide
                     both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a   NOT_EQUALS   or   PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter  on the same field. Combining fil-
                     ters in this way returns an error. CONTAINS  filters  can
                     only  be  used  with other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS
                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,  and   then   the
                     NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For  example,  for  the  following  filters, Security Hub
                     first identifies findings that have resource  types  that
                     start  with  either  AwsIam  or AwsEc2 . It then excludes
                     findings that have a resource type  of  AwsIamPolicy  and
                     findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInter-
                     face .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                        CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be  used  only
                        with  automation  rules.  For  more  information,  see
                        Automation rules in the Security Hub User Guide .

          ResourceApplicationArn -> (list)
              The ARN of the application that is related to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter value, there's no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to apply to a string value when filtering
                     Security Hub findings.

                     To search for values that have the filter value, use  one
                     of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that include the filter value, use
                       CONTAINS .  For  example,  the  filter  Title  CONTAINS
                       CloudFront  matches findings that have a Title that in-
                       cludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use EQUALS . For example, the filter AwsAccoun-
                       tId EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID of 123456789012 .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For  example,  the  filter  ResourceRegion
                       PREFIX  us  matches findings that have a ResourceRegion
                       that starts with us . A ResourceRegion that starts with
                       a  different  value,  such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't
                       match.
                        CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX  filters  on  the  same
                        field  are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                        matches any one of those  filters.  For  example,  the
                        filters  Title  CONTAINS  CloudFront OR Title CONTAINS
                        CloudWatch match a finding that includes either Cloud-
                        Front , CloudWatch , or both strings in the title.

                     To search for values that dont have the filter value, use
                     one of the following comparison operators:

                     o To search for values that exclude the filter value, use
                       NOT_CONTAINS  .  For example, the filter Title NOT_CON-
                       TAINS CloudFront matches findings  that  have  a  Title
                       that excludes the string CloudFront.

                     o To  search  for values other than the filter value, use
                       NOT_EQUALS  .  For  example,  the  filter  AwsAccountId
                       NOT_EQUALS 123456789012 only matches findings that have
                       an account ID other than 123456789012 .

                     o To search for values that don't start with  the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  us  matches  findings
                       with  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with a value other
                       than us .
                        NOT_CONTAINS , NOT_EQUALS , and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                        ters  on  the same field are joined by AND . A finding
                        matches only if it matches all of those  filters.  For

                        Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that ex-
                        cludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the title.

                     You  cant  have both a CONTAINS filter and a NOT_CONTAINS
                     filter on the same field. Similarly,  you  can't  provide

                     filters can only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first   processes   the  PREFIX  filters,  and  then  the

       --group-by-attribute (string)
          The updated GroupBy attribute that defines this insight.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To change the filter for a custom insight

       The  following  update-insight example changes the filters for a custom
       insight. The updated insight looks for findings with  a  high  severity
       that are related to AWS roles.

          aws securityhub update-insight \
              --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --filters '{"ResourceType": [{ "Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "AwsIamRole"}], "SeverityLabel": [{"Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "HIGH"}]}' \
              --name "High severity role findings"

       Example 2: To change the grouping attribute for a custom insight

       The following update-insight example changes the grouping attribute for
       the custom insight with the specified ARN. The new  grouping  attribute
       is the resource ID.

          aws securityhub update-insight \
              --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --group-by-attribute "ResourceId" \
              --name "Critical role findings"

       Output:

          {
              "Insights": [
                  {
                      "InsightArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Name": "Critical role findings",
                      "Filters": {
                          "SeverityLabel": [
                              {
                                  "Value": "CRITICAL",
                                  "Comparison": "EQUALS"
                              }
                          ],
                          "ResourceType": [
                              {
                                  "Value": "AwsIamRole",
                                  "Comparison": "EQUALS"
                              }
                          ]
                      },
                      "GroupByAttribute": "ResourceId"
                  }
              ]
          }
