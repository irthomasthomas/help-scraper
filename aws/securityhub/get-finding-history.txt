GET-FINDING-HISTORY()                                    GET-FINDING-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-finding-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  history  for  a  Security Hub finding in the last 90 days. The
       history includes changes made to any fields in the Amazon Web  Services
       Security Finding Format (ASFF).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-finding-history is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Records

OPTIONS
       --finding-identifier (structure)
          Identifies which finding to get the finding history for.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier of the finding that was specified by the  finding
              provider.

          ProductArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  generated  by  Security Hub that uniquely identifies a
              product that generates findings. This  can  be  the  ARN  for  a
              third-party product that is integrated with Security Hub, or the
              ARN for a custom integration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,ProductArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Id": "string",
            "ProductArn": "string"
          }

       --start-time (timestamp)
          An ISO 8601-formatted timestamp that indicates the start time of the
          requested   finding   history.  A  correctly  formatted  example  is
          2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value cannot contain spaces, and date
          and  time  should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
          3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

          If you provide values for both StartTime and EndTime , Security  Hub
          returns  finding  history for the specified time period. If you pro-
          vide a value for StartTime but not for EndTime ,  Security  Hub  re-
          turns  finding  history  from the StartTime to the time at which the
          API is called. If you provide a value for EndTime but not for Start-
          Time , Security Hub returns finding history from the CreatedAt time-
          stamp of the finding to the EndTime . If you provide neither  Start-
          Time  nor  EndTime  ,  Security Hub returns finding history from the
          CreatedAt timestamp of the finding to the time at which the  API  is
          called.  In  all  of these scenarios, the response is limited to 100
          results, and the maximum time period is limited to 90 days.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          An ISO 8601-formatted timestamp that indicates the end time  of  the
          requested   finding   history.  A  correctly  formatted  example  is
          2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value cannot contain spaces, and date
          and  time  should  be separated by T . For more information, see RFC
          3339 section 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

          If you provide values for both StartTime and EndTime , Security  Hub
          returns  finding  history for the specified time period. If you pro-
          vide a value for StartTime but not for EndTime ,  Security  Hub  re-
          turns  finding  history  from the StartTime to the time at which the
          API is called. If you provide a value for EndTime but not for Start-
          Time , Security Hub returns finding history from the CreatedAt time-
          stamp of the finding to the EndTime . If you provide neither  Start-
          Time  nor  EndTime  ,  Security Hub returns finding history from the
          CreatedAt timestamp of the finding to the time at which the  API  is
          called.  In  all  of these scenarios, the response is limited to 100
          results, and the maximum time period is limited to 90 days.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get finding history

       The  following  get-finding-history example gets up to the last 90 days
       of history for the specified finding. In this example, the results  are
       limited to two records of finding history.

OUTPUT
       Records -> (list)
          A list of events that altered the specified finding during the spec-
          ified time period.

          (structure)
              A  list  of events that changed the specified finding during the
              specified time period. Each record represents a  single  finding
              change event.

              FindingIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Identifies which finding to get the finding history for.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  identifier  of the finding that was specified by the
                     finding provider.

                 ProductArn -> (string)
                     The ARN generated by Security Hub that  uniquely  identi-
                     fies  a  product that generates findings. This can be the
                     ARN for a third-party product that is integrated with Se-
                     curity Hub, or the ARN for a custom integration.

              UpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 An  ISO 8601-formatted timestamp that indicates when Security
                 Hub processed the updated finding record.

                 A correctly formatted example is  2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .
                 The  value cannot contain spaces, and date and time should be
                 separated by T . For more information, see RFC  3339  section
                 5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

              FindingCreated -> (boolean)
                 Identifies  whether  the  event  marks  the creation of a new
                 finding. A value of True means that the finding is newly cre-
                 ated. A value of False means that the finding isnt newly cre-
                 ated.

              UpdateSource -> (structure)
                 Identifies the source of the event that changed the  finding.
                 For  example, an integrated Amazon Web Service or third-party
                 partner   integration   may   call   `    BatchImportFindings
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html`__
                 , or an Security Hub customer may call `  BatchUpdateFindings
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html`__
                 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Describes the type of finding change  event,  such  as  a
                     call           to          `          BatchImportFindings
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html`__
                     (by an integrated Amazon Web Service or third party part-
                     ner     integration)     or     `     BatchUpdateFindings
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html`__
                     (by a Security Hub customer).

                 Identity -> (string)
                     The identity of the source  that  initiated  the  finding
                     change event. For example, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                     of a partner that calls BatchImportFindings or of a  cus-
                     tomer that calls BatchUpdateFindings.

              Updates -> (list)
                 An  array  of objects that provides details about the finding
                 change event, including  the  Amazon  Web  Services  Security
                 Finding  Format  (ASFF)  field that changed, the value of the
                 field before the change, and the value of the field after the
                 change.

                 (structure)
                     An  array of objects that provides details about a change
                     to a finding, including the Amazon Web Services  Security
                     Finding  Format  (ASFF)  field that changed, the value of
                     the field before the change, and the value of  the  field
                     after the change.

                     UpdatedField -> (string)
                        The  ASFF field that changed during the finding change
                        event.

                     OldValue -> (string)
                        The value of the ASFF field before the finding  change
