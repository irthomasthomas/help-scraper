NAME
       batch-enable-standards -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables  the  standards specified by the provided StandardsArn . To ob-

       For more information, see the Security Standards section of  the  Secu-
       rity Hub User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-enable-standards
          --standards-subscription-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --standards-subscription-requests (list)
          The list of standards checks to enable.

          (structure)
              The standard that you want to enable.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the standard that you want to enable. To view the
                 list of available standards and their ARNs, use the Describe-
                 Standards operation.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StandardsArn=string,StandardsInput={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StandardsArn": "string",
              "StandardsInput": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable a standard

       The  following batch-enable-standards example enables the PCI DSS stan-
       dard for the requesting account.

          aws securityhub batch-enable-standards \
              --standards-subscription-requests '{"StandardsArn":"arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"}'

       Output:

          {
              "StandardsSubscriptions": [
                  {
                      "StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1",
                      "StandardsInput": { },
                      "StandardsStatus": "PENDING",
                      "StandardsSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StandardsSubscriptions -> (list)
          The details of the standards subscriptions that were enabled.

          (structure)

              standard.

              StandardsSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource that represents your subscription to  a
                 supported standard.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              StandardsStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the standard subscription.

                 The status values are as follows:

                 o PENDING - Standard is in the process of being enabled.

                 o INCOMPLETE - Standard could not be enabled completely. Some

                 o DELETING - Standard is in the process of being disabled.

                 o FAILED - Standard could not be disabled.

              StandardsStatusReason -> (structure)
                 The reason for the current status.

                 StatusReasonCode -> (string)
                     The reason code that represents the reason for  the  cur-
                     rent status of a standard subscription.
