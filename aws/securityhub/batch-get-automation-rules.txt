OPTIONS
       --automation-rules-arns (list)
          A list of rule ARNs to get details for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details for automation rules

       The following batch-get-automation-rules example gets details  for  the
       specified  automation rule. You can get details for one or more automa-
       tion rules with a single command.

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          A list of rule details for the provided rule ARNs.

          (structure)
              Defines the configuration of an automation rule.

              RuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a rule.

              RuleStatus -> (string)
                 Whether  the  rule is active after it is created. If this pa-
                 rameter is equal to ENABLED , Security  Hub  starts  applying
                 the  rule  to  findings and finding updates after the rule is
                 created.

              RuleOrder -> (integer)
                 An integer ranging from 1 to 1000 that represents  the  order
                 in which the rule action is applied to findings. Security Hub
                 applies rules with lower values for this parameter first.

              RuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the rule.

              IsTerminal -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether a rule is the last to be applied  with  re-
                 spect  to  a  finding that matches the rule criteria. This is
                 useful when a  finding  matches  the  criteria  for  multiple
                 rules, and each rule has different actions. If a rule is ter-
                 minal, Security Hub applies the rule action to a finding that
                 matches  the  rule  criteria and doesn't evaluate other rules
                 for the finding. By default, a rule isn't terminal.

              Criteria -> (structure)
                 A set of Amazon Web Services Security Finding Format  finding
                 field attributes and corresponding expected values that Secu-
                 rity Hub uses to filter findings. If a rule is enabled and  a
                 finding  matches  the conditions specified in this parameter,
                 Security Hub applies the rule action to the finding.

                 ProductArn -> (list)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a third-party  product
                     that generated a finding in Security Hub.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource

                 AwsAccountId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID in which a finding was
                     generated.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 100 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 Id -> (list)
                     The product-specific identifier for a finding.

                     Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.  Maximum  number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,

                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource

                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource

                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 FirstObservedAt -> (list)
                     A  timestamp  that  indicates when the potential security
                     issue captured by a finding was first observed by the se-
                     curity findings product.

                     Uses  the  date-time format specified in RFC 3339 section
                     5.6, Internet Date/Time Format . The value cannot contain
                     spaces. For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)

                     means  100 percent confidence. For example, a data exfil-
                     tration detection based on  a  statistical  deviation  of
                     network  traffic has low confidence because an actual ex-

                     The level of importance that is assigned to the resources
                     that are associated with a finding. Criticality is scored
                     on  a  0100 basis, using a ratio scale that supports only
                     full integers. A score of 0 means that the underlying re-
                     sources  have  no  criticality, and a score of 100 is re-

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub

                 Description -> (list)
                     A finding's description.

                     Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.  Maximum  number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security

                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter

                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-

                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter

                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 SeverityLabel -> (list)
                     The severity value of the finding.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                               User Guide .

                 ResourceType -> (list)
                     The type of resource that the finding pertains to.

                     Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.  Maximum  number

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,

                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 ResourceId -> (list)
                     The  identifier  for  the given resource type. For Amazon
                     Web Services resources that are identified by Amazon  Re-
                     source Names (ARNs), this is the ARN. For Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices resources that lack ARNs, this is the identifier as
                     defined  by  the  Amazon Web Service that created the re-
                     source. For non-Amazon Web Services resources, this is  a
                     unique identifier that is associated with the resource.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                 ResourcePartition -> (list)
                     The partition in which the resource that the finding per-
                     tains to is located. A partition is a group of Amazon Web
                     Services Regions. Each Amazon  Web  Services  account  is
                     scoped to one partition.

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter

                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-

                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string

                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a

                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ResourceTags -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a  re-
                     source at the time the finding was processed.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map  filter provides the field to check for, the value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key of the map filter. For  example,  for  Re-
                            sourceTags  ,  Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For UserDefinedFields , Key is  the  name  of  the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values  for a tag called Department might be Secu-
                            rity . If  you  provide  security  as  the  filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition to apply to the key value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For example, for  the  Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample, a finding with a value of  Security  team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags  field,  the filter Department EQUALS
                              Security matches findings that  have  the  value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS  and  EQUALS filters on the same field
                               are joined by OR .  A  finding  matches  if  it
                               matches  any one of those filters. For example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment  CONTAINS Finance match a finding that
                               includes either Security , Finance  ,  or  both
                               values.

                            To  search  for  values that don't have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example,  for  the
                              ResourceTags   field,   the   filter  Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS Finance matches findings  that  ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags    field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  findings  that  dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field are joined by AND  .  A  finding  matches
                               only  if  it  matches all of those filters. For
                               example, the  filters  Department  NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security  AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS  filters  can  only be used with other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you   cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on  the  same  field.  Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                               matches  any one of those filters. For example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment  CONTAINS Finance match a finding that
                               includes either Security , Finance  ,  or  both
                               values.

                            To  search  for  values that don't have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example,  for  the
                              ResourceTags   field,   the   filter  Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS Finance matches findings  that  ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags    field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_EQUALS Finance matches  findings  that  dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field are joined by AND  .  A  finding  matches
                               only  if  it  matches all of those filters. For
                               example, the  filters  Department  NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security  AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS  filters  can  only be used with other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you   cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on  the  same  field.  Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                 ComplianceStatus -> (list)
                     The result of a security check. This field is  only  used
                     for findings generated from controls.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ComplianceSecurityControlId -> (list)
                     The security control ID for which a  finding  was  gener-
                     ated. Security control IDs are the same across standards.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 ComplianceAssociatedStandardsId -> (list)
                     The unique identifier of a standard in which a control is
                     enabled.  This  field consists of the resource portion of
                     the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) returned for a standard in
                     the DescribeStandards API response.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-

                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-

                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-

                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the

                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 WorkflowStatus -> (list)
                     Provides  information  about the status of the investiga-
                     tion into a finding.

                     Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.  Maximum  number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,

                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-

                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 RelatedFindingsId -> (list)
                     The product-generated identifier for a related finding.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,

                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-

                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-

                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security

                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
                     The timestamp of when the  note  was  updated.  Uses  the
                     date-time  format  specified in RFC 3339 section 5.6, In-
                     ternet Date/Time Format . The value cannot  contain  spa-
                     ces. For example, 2020-03-22T13:22:13.933Z .

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A timestamp that provides the start date  for  the
                            date filter.

                            A      correctly      formatted     example     is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z . The value  cannot  con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by T . For more information, see RFC 3339  section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        End -> (string)
                            A  timestamp  that  provides  the end date for the
                            date filter.

                            A     correctly     formatted      example      is
                            2020-05-21T20:16:34.724Z  .  The value cannot con-
                            tain spaces, and date and time should be separated
                            by  T . For more information, see RFC 3339 section
                            5.6, Internet Date/Time Format .

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
                     The principal that created a note.

                     Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item.  Maximum  number
                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-
                               tion, see Automation rules in the Security  Hub
                               User Guide .

                 UserDefinedFields -> (list)
                     A  list of user-defined name and value string pairs added
                     to a finding.

                     of 20 items.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for filtering Security Hub findings. Each
                        map filter provides the field to check for, the  value
                        to check for, and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there's no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to the key value when  fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings with a map filter.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter Department CONTAINS
                              Security matches findings that include the value
                              Security for the Department tag. In the same ex-
                              ample,  a  finding with a value of Security team
                              for the Department tag is a match.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags field, the filter  Department  EQUALS
                              Security  matches  findings  that have the value
                              Security for the Department tag.
                               CONTAINS and EQUALS filters on the  same  field
                               are  joined  by  OR  .  A finding matches if it
                               matches any one of those filters. For  example,
                               the filters Department CONTAINS Security OR De-
                               partment CONTAINS Finance match a finding  that
                               includes  either  Security  , Finance , or both
                               values.

                            To search for values that don't  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use  NOT_CONTAINS . For example, for the
                              ResourceTags  field,   the   filter   Department
                              NOT_CONTAINS  Finance  matches findings that ex-
                              clude the value Finance for the Department tag.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the Re-
                              sourceTags   field,   the   filter    Department
                              NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings that dont
                              have the value Finance for the Department tag.
                               NOT_CONTAINS and NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                               field  are  joined  by  AND . A finding matches
                               only if it matches all of  those  filters.  For
                               example,  the  filters  Department NOT_CONTAINS
                               Security AND  Department  NOT_CONTAINS  Finance
                               match a finding that excludes both the Security
                               and Finance values.

                               CONTAINS filters can only be  used  with  other
                               CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can only
                               be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you  cant  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and   a
                            NOT_EQUALS  filter  on  the  same field. Combining
                            filters in this way returns an error.
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                 ResourceApplicationArn -> (list)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application that is
                     related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter value, there's  no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To search for values that have the  filter  value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To  search  for  values  that include the filter
                              value, use CONTAINS . For  example,  the  filter
                              Title  CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings that
                              have a Title that  includes  the  string  Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId  EQUALS  123456789012  only matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceRegion  PREFIX  us  matches  findings that
                              have a ResourceRegion that starts with  us  .  A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS , EQUALS , and PREFIX filters  on  the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding  that
                               includes  either  CloudFront  , CloudWatch , or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To search for values that  dont  have  the  filter
                            value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                            tors:

                            o To search for values  that  exclude  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the fil-
                              ter Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches  find-
                              ings  that have a Title that excludes the string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To search  for  values  other  than  the  filter
                              value,  use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId   NOT_EQUALS   123456789012    only
                              matches  findings  that have an account ID other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To search for values that don't start  with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us  matches  findings with a ResourceRegion that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS   ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and    PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  on  the same field are
                               joined by AND . A finding matches  only  if  it
                               matches  all of those filters. For example, the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS  CloudWatch  match  a finding that
                               excludes both CloudFront and CloudWatch in  the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS filter on the same field.  Similarly,
                            you  can't  provide  both  an  EQUALS filter and a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field.  Combining  filters  in this way returns an
                            error. CONTAINS filters  can  only  be  used  with
                            other  CONTAINS  filters. NOT_CONTAINS filters can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for the following filters, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only  with  automation rules. For more informa-

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIam or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used
                               only with automation rules. For  more  informa-
                               tion,  see Automation rules in the Security Hub
                               User Guide .

                 AwsAccountName -> (list)
                     The name of the Amazon Web Services account  in  which  a
                     finding was generated.

                     Array  Members:  Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for filtering Security Hub findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security hub as the filter value, there's no
                            match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply to a string value when fil-
                            tering Security Hub findings.

                            To  search  for values that have the filter value,
                            use one of the following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values  that  include  the  filter
                              value,  use  CONTAINS  . For example, the filter
                              Title CONTAINS CloudFront matches findings  that
                              have  a  Title  that  includes the string Cloud-
                              Front.

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              AwsAccountId EQUALS  123456789012  only  matches
                              findings that have an account ID of 123456789012
                              .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceRegion PREFIX  us  matches  findings  that
                              have  a  ResourceRegion  that starts with us . A
                              ResourceRegion  that  starts  with  a  different
                              value, such as af , ap , or ca , doesn't match.
                               CONTAINS  ,  EQUALS , and PREFIX filters on the
                               same field are joined by OR . A finding matches
                               if it matches any one of those filters. For ex-
                               ample, the filters Title CONTAINS CloudFront OR
                               Title  CONTAINS CloudWatch match a finding that
                               includes either CloudFront ,  CloudWatch  ,  or
                               both strings in the title.

                            To  search  for  values  that dont have the filter
                            value, use one of the following comparison  opera-
                            tors:

                            o To  search  for  values  that exclude the filter
                              value, use NOT_CONTAINS . For example, the  fil-
                              ter  Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront matches find-
                              ings that have a Title that excludes the  string
                              CloudFront.

                            o To  search  for  values  other  than  the filter
                              value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              AwsAccountId    NOT_EQUALS   123456789012   only
                              matches findings that have an account  ID  other
                              than 123456789012 .

                            o To  search  for values that don't start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple, the filter ResourceRegion PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              us matches findings with a  ResourceRegion  that
                              starts with a value other than us .
                               NOT_CONTAINS    ,   NOT_EQUALS   ,   and   PRE-
                               FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the  same  field  are
                               joined  by  AND  . A finding matches only if it
                               matches all of those filters. For example,  the
                               filters Title NOT_CONTAINS CloudFront AND Title
                               NOT_CONTAINS CloudWatch match  a  finding  that
                               excludes  both CloudFront and CloudWatch in the
                               title.

                            You  cant  have  both  a  CONTAINS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_CONTAINS  filter on the same field. Similarly,
                            you can't provide both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter on the same
                            field. Combining filters in this  way  returns  an
                            error.  CONTAINS  filters  can  only  be used with
                            other CONTAINS filters. NOT_CONTAINS  filters  can
                            only be used with other NOT_CONTAINS filters.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, and
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the following  filters,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource

                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface
                               CONTAINS and NOT_CONTAINS operators can be used

                            Normalized -> (integer)
                               The  normalized  severity for the finding. This
                               attribute is to be deprecated in favor of Label

                               ation of new findings. For example, setting the
                               workflow  status to SUPPRESSED or RESOLVED does
                               not prevent a new finding for the same issue.

                                 owner,  and  needs  intervention from the re-
                                 source owner.

                               o RESOLVED - The finding was reviewed and reme-
                                 diated and is now considered resolved.

                                 finding and do not believe that any action is
                                 needed. The finding is no longer updated.
