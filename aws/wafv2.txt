NAME
       wafv2 -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This  is  the  latest  version of the WAF API, released in November,
          2019. The names of the entities that you use  to  access  this  API,
          like  endpoints  and namespaces, all have the versioning information
          added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version.  We
          recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a
          number of significant improvements.

          If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2  API
          to  access  any  WAF  resources that you created before. WAF Classic
          support will end on September 30, 2025.

          For information about WAF, including how to migrate your WAF Classic
          resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide .

       WAF  is  a  web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and
       HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution,
       Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL
       API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  Verified  Access  instance.  WAF also lets you control access to
       your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that  WAF  is
       monitoring.  Based  on  conditions that you specify, such as the IP ad-
       dresses that requests originate from or the values  of  query  strings,
       the  protected  resource responds to requests with either the requested
       content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden),  or  with  a  custom  re-
       sponse.

       This  API  guide  is for developers who need detailed information about
       WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about
       WAF  features  and  guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the WAF
       Developer Guide .

       You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quo-
       tas .

       o For  regional  applications,  you can use any of the endpoints in the
         list. A regional application can  be  an  Application  Load  Balancer
         (ALB),  an  Amazon  API  Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an
         Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service,  or  an  Amazon  Web
         Services Verified Access instance.

       o For  Amazon  CloudFront  applications,  you must use the API endpoint
         listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.

       Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs  to  ac-
       cess  an  API  that's  tailored to the programming language or platform
       that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs .
