          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string) The name of the queue that you want information about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Queue -> (structure)
          You can use queues to manage the resources  that  are  available  to
          your  AWS  account for running multiple transcoding jobs at the same
          time. If you don't specify a  queue,  the  service  sends  all  jobs
          through    the    default   queue.   For   more   information,   see
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-queues.html.

          Arn -> (string)
              An  identifier  for  this  resource that is unique within all of
              AWS.

          ConcurrentJobs -> (integer)
              The maximum number of jobs your queue can process concurrently.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you created the queue.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description that you create for each queue.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you  most  recently  up-
              dated the queue.

          Name -> (string)
              A  name that you create for each queue. Each name must be unique
              within your account.

          PricingPlan -> (string)
              Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand or
              reserved.  For  on-demand,  you pay per minute, billed in incre-
              ments of .01 minute. For reserved, you pay for  the  transcoding
              capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how lit-
              tle you use it. Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.

          ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

          ReservationPlan -> (structure)
              Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required
              for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

              Commitment -> (string)
                 The  length  of  the term of your reserved queue pricing plan
                 commitment.

              ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for when the  current  pricing
                 plan term for this reserved queue expires.

              PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds for when you set up the cur-
                 rent pricing plan for this reserved queue.

              RenewalType -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the term of  your  reserved  queue  pricing
                 plan  is  automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or expires (EX-
                 PIRE) at the end of the term.

              ReservedSlots -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of reserved transcode  slots  (RTS)  for
                 this  queue.  The  number of RTS determines how many jobs the
                 queue can process in parallel; each RTS can process  one  job
                 at a time. When you increase this number, you extend your ex-
                 isting commitment with a new 12-month commitment for a larger
                 number  of  RTS.  The new commitment begins when you purchase
                 the additional capacity. You can't decrease the number of RTS
                 in your reserved queue.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is
                 ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

          ServiceOverrides -> (list)
              A list of any service overrides applied by MediaConvert  to  the
              settings  that you have configured. If you see any overrides, we
              recommend that you contact AWS Support.

              (structure)
                 A service override applied by MediaConvert  to  the  settings

                     The  value  of  the setting that you configured, prior to
                     any overrides that MediaConvert has applied.

          Status -> (string)
              Queues can be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue,  the  ser-
              vice  won't  begin  processing jobs in that queue. Jobs that are
              running when you pause the queue continue to run until they fin-
              ish or result in an error.

          SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies whether this on-demand queue is system or custom. Sys-
              tem queues are built in.  You  can't  modify  or  delete  system
              queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
