OPTIONS
       --description (string) Optional. A description of the  queue  that  you
       are creating.

       --name (string) The name of the queue that you are creating.

       --pricing-plan  (string)  Specifies  whether  the  pricing plan for the
       queue is on-demand or reserved. For  on-demand,  you  pay  per  minute,
       billed  in  increments  of  .01  minute.  For reserved, you pay for the
       transcoding capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how
       little  you  use  it.  Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.
       When you use the API to create a queue, the default is on-demand.
          Possible values:

          o ON_DEMAND

          o RESERVED

       --reservation-plan-settings (structure) Details about the pricing  plan
       for  your reserved queue. Required for reserved queues and not applica-
       ble to on-demand queues.Commitment -> (string)
              The length of the term of your reserved queue pricing plan  com-
              mitment.

          RenewalType -> (string)
              Specifies  whether  the term of your reserved queue pricing plan
              is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or  expires  (EXPIRE)  at
              the  end of the term. When your term is auto renewed, you extend
              your commitment by 12 months from the auto renew date.  You  can
              cancel this commitment.

          ReservedSlots -> (integer)
              Specifies  the number of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for this
              queue. The number of RTS determines how many jobs the queue  can
              process in parallel; each RTS can process one job at a time. You
              can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue. You can
              increase the number of RTS by extending your existing commitment
              with a new 12-month commitment for the larger  number.  The  new
              commitment begins when you purchase the additional capacity. You
              can't cancel your commitment or revert to your original  commit-
              ment after you increase the capacity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Commitment=string,RenewalType=string,ReservedSlots=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Commitment": "ONE_YEAR",
            "RenewalType": "AUTO_RENEW"|"EXPIRE",
            "ReservedSlots": integer
          }

       --status  (string)  Initial  state of the queue. If you create a paused
       queue, then jobs in that queue won't begin.
          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o PAUSED

       --tags (map) The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag
       resources with a key-value pair or with only a key.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a custom queue

       The following create-queue example creates a custom transcoding queue.

          aws mediaconvert create-queue \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --name Queue1 \
              --description "Keep this queue empty unless job is urgent."

       To get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or  send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       Output:

          {
              "Queue": {
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "Name": "Queue1",
                  "LastUpdated": 1518034928,
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:region-name-1:012345678998:queues/Queue1",
                  "Type": "CUSTOM",
                  "CreatedAt": 1518034928,
                  "Description": "Keep this queue empty unless job is urgent."
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Queue -> (structure)
          You  can  use  queues  to manage the resources that are available to
          your AWS account for running multiple transcoding jobs at  the  same
          time.  If  you  don't  specify  a  queue, the service sends all jobs
          through   the   default   queue.   For   more    information,    see
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-queues.html.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you created the queue.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description that you create for each queue.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamp  in  epoch seconds for when you most recently up-
              dated the queue.

          Name -> (string)
              A name that you create for each queue. Each name must be  unique
              within your account.

          PricingPlan -> (string)
              Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand or
              reserved. For on-demand, you pay per minute,  billed  in  incre-
              ments  of  .01 minute. For reserved, you pay for the transcoding
              capacity of the entire queue, regardless of how much or how lit-
              tle you use it. Reserved pricing requires a 12-month commitment.

          ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

          ReservationPlan -> (structure)
              Details about the pricing plan for your reserved queue. Required
              for reserved queues and not applicable to on-demand queues.

              Commitment -> (string)
                 The length of the term of your reserved  queue  pricing  plan
                 commitment.

              ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds for when the current pricing
                 plan term for this reserved queue expires.

              PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you set up  the  cur-
                 rent pricing plan for this reserved queue.

              RenewalType -> (string)
                 Specifies  whether  the  term  of your reserved queue pricing
                 plan is automatically extended (AUTO_RENEW) or  expires  (EX-
                 PIRE) at the end of the term.

              ReservedSlots -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  number  of reserved transcode slots (RTS) for
                 this queue. The number of RTS determines how  many  jobs  the
                 queue  can  process in parallel; each RTS can process one job
                 at a time. When you increase this number, you extend your ex-
                 isting commitment with a new 12-month commitment for a larger
                 number of RTS. The new commitment begins  when  you  purchase
                 the additional capacity. You can't decrease the number of RTS
                 in your reserved queue.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the pricing plan for your reserved queue is
                 ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

          Status -> (string)
              Queues  can  be ACTIVE or PAUSED. If you pause a queue, the ser-
              vice won't begin processing jobs in that queue.  Jobs  that  are
              running when you pause the queue continue to run until they fin-
              ish or result in an error.

          SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)
              The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

          Type -> (string)
              Specifies whether this on-demand queue is system or custom. Sys-
              tem  queues  are  built  in.  You  can't modify or delete system
              queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
