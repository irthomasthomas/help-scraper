LIST-PRESETS()                                                  LIST-PRESETS()



NAME
       list-presets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve a JSON array of up to twenty of your presets. This will return
       the presets themselves, not just a list of them. To retrieve  the  next
       twenty presets, use the nextToken string returned with the array.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-presets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Presets

OPTIONS
       --category (string) Optionally, specify a preset category to limit  re-
       sponses to only presets from that category.

       --list-by  (string)  Optional.  When you request a list of presets, you
       can choose to list them alphabetically by NAME  or  chronologically  by
       CREATION_DATE.  If  you  don't  specify,  the service will list them by
       name.
          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATION_DATE

          o SYSTEM

       --order (string) Optional. When you request lists of resources, you can
       specify  whether  they are sorted in ASCENDING or DESCENDING order. De-
       fault varies by resource.
          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Use this string to request the next batch of presets.

       Presets -> (list)
          List of presets

          (structure)
              A preset is a collection of preconfigured media conversion  set-
              tings  that  you want MediaConvert to apply to the output during
              the conversion process.

              Arn -> (string)
                 An identifier for this resource that is unique within all  of
                 AWS.

              Category -> (string)
                 An optional category you create to organize your presets.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for preset creation.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description you create for each preset.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds when the preset was last up-
                 dated.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name you create for each preset. Each name must  be  unique
                 within your account.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 Settings for preset

                 AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                     Contains  groups  of audio encoding settings organized by
                     audio codec. Include one instance of per output. Can con-
                     tain multiple groups of encoding settings.

                     (structure)
                        Settings  related to one audio tab on the MediaConvert
                        console. In your job JSON,  an  instance  of  AudioDe-
                        scription  is  equivalent to one audio tab in the con-
                        sole. Usually, one audio tab corresponds to one output
                        audio  track.  Depending  on how you set up your input
                        audio selectors and whether  you  use  audio  selector
                        groups,  one  audio  tab  can correspond to a group of
                        output audio tracks.

                        AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                            Specify the QuickTime audio  channel  layout  tags
                            for  the  audio channels in this audio track. When
                            you don't specify  a  value,  MediaConvert  labels
                            your  track as Center (C) by default. To use Audio
                            layout tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime
                            (MOV)  container and your audio codec must be AAC,
                            WAV, or AIFF.

                            ChannelTag -> (string)
                               Specify the QuickTime audio channel layout tags
                               for the audio channels in this audio track. En-
                               ter channel layout tags in the  same  order  as
                               your output's audio channel order. For example,
                               if your output audio track has  a  left  and  a
                               right  channel,  enter  Left  (L) for the first
                               channel and Right (R) for the second.  If  your
                               output   has   multiple   single-channel  audio
                               tracks, enter a single channel layout  tag  for
                               each track.

                            ChannelTags -> (list)
                               Specify the QuickTime audio channel layout tags
                               for the audio channels in this audio track. En-
                               ter  channel  layout  tags in the same order as
                               your output's audio channel order. For example,
                               if  your  output  audio  track has a left and a
                               right channel, enter Left  (L)  for  the  first
                               channel  and  Right (R) for the second. If your
                               output  has   multiple   single-channel   audio
                               tracks,  enter  a single channel layout tag for
                               each track.

                               (string)
                                   Specify the QuickTime audio channel  layout
                                   tags  for  the audio channels in this audio
                                   track. Enter channel  layout  tags  in  the
                                   same  order  as your output's audio channel
                                   order. For example, if  your  output  audio
                                   track has a left and a right channel, enter
                                   Left (L) for the first  channel  and  Right
                                   (R) for the second. If your output has mul-
                                   tiple single-channel audio tracks, enter  a
                                   single channel layout tag for each track.

                        AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                            Advanced   audio  normalization  settings.  Ignore
                            these settings unless you need to  comply  with  a
                            loudness standard.

                            Algorithm -> (string)

                            AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                               When enabled the output audio is corrected  us-
                               ing  the chosen algorithm. If disabled, the au-
                               dio will be measured but not adjusted.

                            CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                               Content measuring above this level will be cor-
                               rected  to  the target level. Content measuring
                               below this level will not be corrected.

                            LoudnessLogging -> (string)
                               If set to LOG, log each  output's  audio  track
                               loudness to a CSV file.

                            PeakCalculation -> (string)
                               If  set  to  TRUE_PEAK,  calculate  and log the

                            TargetLkfs -> (double)
                               When  you  use  Audio normalization, optionally
                               use this setting to specify a target  loudness.
                               If  you don't specify a value here, the encoder
                               chooses a value for you, based on the algorithm
                               that  you  choose  for Algorithm. If you choose
                               algorithm 1770-1, the encoder will  choose  -24
                               LKFS;  otherwise,  the  encoder will choose -23
                               LKFS.

                            TruePeakLimiterThreshold -> (double)
                               Specify  the  True-peak  limiter  threshold  in
                               decibels  relative  to  full  scale (dBFS). The
                               peak inter-audio sample loudness in your output
                               will  be limited to the value that you specify,
                               without affecting the overall target LKFS.  En-
                               ter  a  value  from 0 to -8. Leave blank to use
                               the default value 0.

                        AudioSourceName -> (string)
                            Specifies which audio data to use from each input.
                            In  the  simplest  case,  specify an "Audio Selec-
                            tor":#inputs-audio_selector by name based  on  its
                            order  within each input. For example if you spec-
                            ify "Audio Selector 3", then the third  audio  se-
                            lector  will  be used from each input. If an input
                            does not have an "Audio Selector 3", then the  au-
                            dio  selector  marked  as  "default" in that input
                            will be used. If there is no audio selector marked
                            as "default", silence will be inserted for the du-
                            ration of that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Se-
                            lector   Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group  name
                            may be specified, with similar default/silence be-
                            havior. If no audio_source_name is specified, then
                            "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.

                        AudioType -> (integer)
                            Applies  only  if  Follow  Input  Audio  Type   is
                            unchecked (false). A number between 0 and 255. The

                        AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                            When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input contains an
                            ISO 639 audio_type,  then  that  value  is  passed
                            through  to  the  output. If the input contains no
                            ISO 639 audio_type, the value in Audio Type is in-
                            cluded in the output. Otherwise the value in Audio
                            Type is included in the  output.  Note  that  this
                            field  and  audioType are both ignored if audioDe-

                        CodecSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to audio encoding. The settings
                            in this group vary depending on the value that you
                            choose for your audio codec.

                            AacSettings -> (structure)
                               Required  when  you set Codec to the value AAC.
                               The service accepts one of two mutually  exclu-
                               sive  groups  of  AAC settings--VBR and CBR. To
                               select one of these modes, set the value of Bi-
                               trate  control  mode  to "VBR" or "CBR". In VBR
                               mode, you control the audio  quality  with  the
                               setting  VBR  quality. In CBR mode, you use the
                               setting Bitrate. Defaults and valid values  de-
                               pend on the rate control mode.

                               AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)
                                   Choose  BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input
                                   contains pre-mixed main audio +  audio  de-
                                   scription  (AD) as a stereo pair. The value
                                   for AudioType will be set to 3, which  sig-
                                   nals to downstream systems that this stream
                                   contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note  that
                                   the input received by the encoder must con-
                                   tain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does  not
                                   perform  the mixing. When you choose BROAD-
                                   CASTER_MIXED_AD, the  encoder  ignores  any
                                   values you provide in AudioType and Follow-
                                   InputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the  in-
                                   put  does not contain pre-mixed audio + au-
                                   dio description (AD). In this case, the en-
                                   coder  will  use any values you provide for
                                   AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.

                               Bitrate -> (integer)
                                   Specify the average  bitrate  in  bits  per
                                   second.  The  set  of valid values for this
                                   setting  is:  6000,  8000,  10000,   12000,
                                   14000,  16000,  20000, 24000, 28000, 32000,

                                   1024000. The value you  set  is  also  con-
                                   strained  by the values that you choose for
                                   Profile, Bitrate control mode,  and  Sample
                                   rate. Default values depend on Bitrate con-

                                   or  HEV2.  HEV1  (AAC-HE  v1) adds spectral
                                   band replication to improve speech audio at
                                   low  bitrates.  HEV2 (AAC-HE v2) adds para-
                                   metric stereo, which optimizes for encoding
                                   stereo audio at very low bitrates.

                               CodingMode -> (string)
                                   The Coding mode that you specify determines
                                   the number of audio channels and the  audio
                                   channel layout metadata in your AAC output.
                                   Valid coding modes depend on the Rate  con-

                               RateControlMode -> (string)
                                   Specify the AAC rate control  mode.  For  a
                                   constant bitrate: Choose CBR. Your AAC out-
                                   put bitrate will be equal to the value that
                                   you  choose for Bitrate. For a variable bi-
                                   trate: Choose VBR. Your AAC output  bitrate
                                   will  vary  according to your audio content
                                   and the value that you choose  for  Bitrate
                                   quality.

                               RawFormat -> (string)
                                   Enables  LATM/LOAS AAC output. Note that if
                                   you use LATM/LOAS AAC  in  an  output,  you
                                   must  choose  "No container" for the output
                                   container.

                                   Specify the AAC sample rate in samples  per
                                   second  (Hz).  Valid sample rates depend on
                                   the AAC profile and Coding  mode  that  you
                                   select.  For  a  list  of  supported sample

                                   stream,  we  recommend  that  you  use  the
                                   mode-specific  settings  instead of Dynamic

                                   stead of the mode-specific settings, choose
                                   None  to  leave out DRC signaling. Keep the
                                   default Film standard to set the profile to

                            WavSettings -> (structure)
                               Required when you set Codec to the value WAV.

                               BitDepth -> (integer)
                                   Specify Bit depth, in bits per  sample,  to
                                   choose  the encoding quality for this audio

                               Channels -> (integer)
                                   Specify the number of channels in this out-
                                   put  audio  track.  Valid  values are 1 and
                                   even numbers up to 64. For example,  1,  2,
                                   4, 6, and so on, up to 64.

                               Format -> (string)
                                   The  service defaults to using RIFF for WAV
                                   outputs. If your output audio is likely  to
                                   exceed  4 GB in file size, or if you other-
                                   wise need the extended support of the  RF64
                                   format,  set your output WAV file format to
                                   RF64.

                               SampleRate -> (integer)
                                   Sample rate in Hz.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify the language for this audio output  track.
                            The service puts this language code into your out-
                            put audio track when you set Language code control
                            to  Use  configured.  The  service  also uses your
                            specified custom language code when you  set  Lan-
                            guage code control to Follow input, but your input
                            file doesn't specify a language code. For all out-
                            puts,  you can use an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code.
                            For streaming outputs, you can also use any  other
                            code in the full RFC-5646 specification. Streaming
                            outputs are those that are in one of the following
                            output  groups:  CMAF, DASH ISO, Apple HLS, or Mi-
                            crosoft Smooth Streaming.

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Indicates the language of the audio output  track.
                            The  ISO  639  language specified in the 'Language
                            Code' drop down will be used  when  'Follow  Input
                            Language Code' is not selected or when 'Follow In-
                            put Language Code' is selected but there is no ISO
                            639 language code specified by the input.

                        LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                            Specify  which  source  for  language  code  takes
                            precedence for this audio track. When  you  choose
                            Follow  input,  the service uses the language code
                            from the input track if it's present.  If  there's
                            no  languge  code  on the input track, the service
                            uses the code that you specify in the setting Lan-
                            guage  code.  When  you choose Use configured, the
                            service uses the language code that you specify.

                        RemixSettings -> (structure)
                            Advanced audio remixing settings.

                            ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                               Channel mapping contains the  group  of  fields
                               that  hold the remixing value for each channel,
                               in dB. Specify remix  values  to  indicate  how
                               much of the content from your input audio chan-
                               nel you want in  your  output  audio  channels.
                               Each  instance  of  the  InputChannels  or  In-
                               putChannelsFineTune array specifies these  val-
                               ues for one output channel. Use one instance of
                               this array for each output channel. In the con-
                               sole, each array corresponds to a column in the
                               graphical depiction of the mapping matrix.  The
                               rows  of the graphical matrix correspond to in-
                               put channels. Valid values are within the range
                               from  -60  (mute)  through  6.  A  setting of 0
                               passes the input channel unchanged to the  out-
                               put  channel (no attenuation or amplification).
                               Use InputChannels or  InputChannelsFineTune  to
                               specify your remix values. Don't use both.

                               OutputChannels -> (list)
                                   In your JSON job specification, include one

                                   channel  that you want in your output. Each
                                   child should contain one  instance  of  In-
                                   putChannels or InputChannelsFineTune.

                            ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                               Specify the number of audio channels from  your
                               input that you want to use in your output. With
                               remixing, you might combine or split  the  data
                               in these channels, so the number of channels in
                               your final output might be  different.  If  you
                               are doing both input channel mapping and output
                               channel mapping, the number of output  channels
                               in  your  input mapping must be the same as the

                               Specify  the  number of channels in this output
                               after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2, 4, 6,  8...

                        StreamName -> (string)
                            Specify  a label for this output audio stream. For
                            example,  "English",  "Director  commentary",   or
                            "track_2".  For  streaming  outputs,  MediaConvert
                            passes this information into destination manifests
                            for display on the end-viewer's player device. For

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  language  for  this  captions output
                            track. For most captions output formats,  the  en-
                            coder puts this language information in the output
                            captions metadata. If your output captions  format
                            is  DVB-Sub or Burn in, the encoder uses this lan-
                            guage information when automatically selecting the
                            font  script  for rendering the captions text. For
                            all outputs, you can use an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                            code.  For streaming outputs, you can also use any
                            other code in  the  full  RFC-5646  specification.
                            Streaming outputs are those that are in one of the
                            following output groups:  CMAF,  DASH  ISO,  Apple
                            HLS, or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                               pixels  of video content with the captions. Set

                                   no explicit x_position is provided, setting
                                   alignment  to  centered  will placethe cap-

                                   Similarly,   setting   a   left   alignment
                                   willalign captions to the  bottom  left  of
                                   the  output. If x and y positions are given

                                   white  text, your output captions will have
                                   red  and  yellow  text.  When  you   choose
                                   ALL_TEXT,  your  font color setting applies

                                   Specify the color of the  rectangle  behind
                                   the  captions. Leave background color blank
                                   and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                                   the  background  color data from your input
                                   captions, if present.

                               BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify the opacity of the background  rec-
                                   tangle.  Enter a value from 0 to 255, where
                                   0 is transparent  and  255  is  opaque.  If
                                   Style  passthrough is set to enabled, leave
                                   blank to pass through the background  style
                                   information  in your input captions to your
                                   output captions. If  Style  passthrough  is
                                   set to disabled, leave blank to use a value
                                   of 0 and remove all backgrounds  from  your
                                   output captions.

                               FallbackFont -> (string)
                                   Specify  the font that you want the service
                                   to use for your burn in captions when  your
                                   input  captions  specify a font that Media-
                                   Convert doesn't support. When you set Fall-
                                   back  font  to  best match, or leave blank,
                                   MediaConvert uses  a  supported  font  that
                                   most closely matches the font that your in-
                                   put captions specify. When there are multi-
                                   ple  unsupported  fonts  in your input cap-
                                   tions, MediaConvert matches each font  with
                                   the  supported font that matches best. When
                                   you explicitly choose a  replacement  font,
                                   MediaConvert  uses that font to replace all
                                   unsupported fonts from your input.

                               FontColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the burned-in captions
                                   text.  Leave Font color blank and set Style
                                   passthrough to  enabled  to  use  the  font
                                   color  data  from  your  input captions, if
                                   present.

                               FontOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify the opacity of the  burned-in  cap-
                                   tions. 255 is opaque; 0 is transparent.

                               FontResolution -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  Font  resolution in DPI (dots
                                   per inch).

                               FontScript -> (string)
                                   Set Font  script  to  Automatically  deter-
                                   mined, or leave blank, to automatically de-

                                   (HANS) or  Traditional  Chinese  (HANT)  if
                                   your  input  font script uses Simplified or
                                   Traditional Chinese.

                               FontSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Font size in pixels. Must be  a
                                   positive integer. Set to 0, or leave blank,
                                   for automatic font size.

                               HexFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore this setting unless your Font  color
                                   is  set  to  Hex. Enter either six or eight
                                   hexidecimal   digits,   representing   red,
                                   green,  and  blue,  with two optional extra
                                   digits for alpha. For example  a  value  of
                                   1122AABB  is  a  red value of 0x11, a green
                                   value of 0x22, a blue value of 0xAA, and an
                                   alpha value of 0xBB.

                               OutlineColor -> (string)
                                   Specify  font  outline color. Leave Outline
                                   color blank and set  Style  passthrough  to
                                   enabled  to use the font outline color data
                                   from your input captions, if present.

                               OutlineSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Outline  size  of  the  caption
                                   text,  in  pixels. Leave Outline size blank
                                   and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                                   the  outline size data from your input cap-
                                   tions, if present.

                               ShadowColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the shadow cast by the
                                   captions.  Leave Shadow color blank and set
                                   Style passthrough to  enabled  to  use  the
                                   shadow color data from your input captions,
                                   if present.

                               ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify the opacity of the shadow. Enter  a
                                   value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent
                                   and 255 is opaque. If Style passthrough  is
                                   set  to Enabled, leave Shadow opacity blank
                                   to pass through the shadow  style  informa-
                                   tion  in your input captions to your output
                                   captions. If Style passthrough  is  set  to
                                   disabled,  leave  blank to use a value of 0
                                   and remove all  shadows  from  your  output
                                   captions.

                               ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                                   Specify   the   horizontal  offset  of  the
                                   shadow, relative to the captions in pixels.
                                   A value of -2 would result in a shadow off-
                                   set 2 pixels to the left.

                               ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                                   Specify the vertical offset of  the  shadow
                                   relative to the captions in pixels. A value
                                   of -2 would result in  a  shadow  offset  2
                                   pixels  above the text. Leave Shadow y-off-
                                   set blank and set Style passthrough to  en-
                                   abled  to use the shadow y-offset data from
                                   your input captions, if present.

                               StylePassthrough -> (string)
                                   Set Style passthrough to ENABLED to use the
                                   available style, color, and position infor-
                                   mation from your input captions.  MediaCon-
                                   vert  uses default settings for any missing
                                   style and position information in your  in-
                                   put captions. Set Style passthrough to DIS-
                                   ABLED, or leave blank, to ignore the  style
                                   and  position  information  from your input
                                   captions and use  default  settings:  white

                                   positioning, and automatic sizing.  Whether
                                   you  set  Style  passthrough  to enabled or
                                   not, you can also choose to manually  over-
                                   ride  any of the individual style and posi-
                                   tion settings.

                               TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                                   Specify whether the text  spacing  in  your
                                   captions  is  set  by the captions grid, or
                                   varies depending on  letter  width.  Choose
                                   fixed grid to conform to the spacing speci-
                                   fied in the captions file more  accurately.
                                   Choose proportional to make the text easier
                                   to read for closed captions.

                               XPosition -> (integer)
                                   Specify the horizontal position of the cap-
                                   tions,  relative  to  the  left side of the
                                   output in pixels. A value of 10  would  re-
                                   sult  in  the  captions  starting 10 pixels
                                   from the left of the output. If no explicit
                                   x_position is provided, the horizontal cap-
                                   tion position will  be  determined  by  the
                                   alignment parameter.

                               YPosition -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  vertical position of the cap-
                                   tions, relative to the top of the output in
                                   pixels.  A  value of 10 would result in the
                                   captions starting 10 pixels from the top of
                                   the  output.  If  no explicit y_position is
                                   provided, the caption  will  be  positioned
                                   towards the bottom of the output.

                            DestinationType -> (string)
                               Specify  the format for this set of captions on
                               this output. The  default  format  is  embedded
                               without SCTE-20. Note that your choice of video
                               output container constrains your choice of out-
                               put  captions format. For more information, see
                               https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html.
                               If you are using SCTE-20 and you want to create
                               an output that complies with the SCTE-43  spec,
                               choose  SCTE-20  plus  embedded.  To  create  a
                               non-compliant output where  the  embedded  cap-
                               tions come first, choose Embedded plus SCTE-20.

                            DvbSubDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  related  to  DVB-Sub captions. Set up
                               DVB-Sub captions in the  same  output  as  your
                               video.     For     more     information,    see
                               https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/dvb-sub-output-captions.html.

                               Alignment -> (string)
                                   Specify  the alignment of your captions. If
                                   no explicit x_position is provided, setting
                                   alignment  to  centered  will placethe cap-
                                   tions at the bottom center of  the  output.
                                   Similarly,   setting   a   left   alignment
                                   willalign captions to the  bottom  left  of
                                   the  output. If x and y positions are given
                                   in conjunction with the  alignment  parame-
                                   ter,  the  font  will  be justified (either
                                   left or centered) relative to those coordi-
                                   nates.  Within  your  job  settings, all of
                                   your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore   this    setting    unless    Style
                                   Passthrough  is  set  to  Enabled  and Font
                                   color set to  Black,  Yellow,  Red,  Green,
                                   Blue,  or Hex. Use Apply font color for ad-
                                   ditional  font  color  controls.  When  you
                                   choose  White  text  only,  or leave blank,
                                   your font color  setting  only  applies  to
                                   white  text in your input captions. For ex-
                                   ample, if your font color setting  is  Yel-
                                   low,  and  your input captions have red and
                                   white text, your output captions will  have
                                   red   and  yellow  text.  When  you  choose
                                   ALL_TEXT, your font color  setting  applies
                                   to all of your output captions text.

                               BackgroundColor -> (string)
                                   Specify  the  color of the rectangle behind
                                   the captions. Leave background color  blank
                                   and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                                   the background color data from  your  input
                                   captions, if present.

                               BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the opacity of the background rec-
                                   tangle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where
                                   0  is  transparent  and  255  is opaque. If
                                   Style passthrough is set to enabled,  leave
                                   blank  to pass through the background style
                                   information in your input captions to  your
                                   output  captions.  If  Style passthrough is
                                   set to disabled, leave blank to use a value
                                   of  0  and remove all backgrounds from your
                                   output captions. Within your job  settings,
                                   all  of your DVB-Sub settings must be iden-
                                   tical.

                               DdsHandling -> (string)
                                   Specify how MediaConvert handles  the  dis-
                                   play  definition  segment (DDS). To exclude
                                   the DDS from this set of captions: Keep the
                                   default,  None.  To include the DDS: Choose
                                   Specified. When you do,  also  specify  the
                                   offset  coordinates  of  the display window
                                   with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate.
                                   To include the DDS, but not include display
                                   window data: Choose No display window. When
                                   you  do, you can write position metadata to
                                   the page composition segment (PCS) with DDS
                                   x-coordinate   and  DDS  y-coordinate.  For
                                   video resolutions with a height of 576 pix-
                                   els  or  less, MediaConvert doesn't include
                                   the DDS, regardless of the value you choose
                                   for  DDS  handling. All burn-in and DVB-Sub
                                   font settings must match.

                               DdsXCoordinate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting, along with DDS  y-coordi-
                                   nate,  to  specify the upper left corner of
                                   the display definition segment  (DDS)  dis-
                                   play window. With this setting, specify the
                                   distance, in pixels, between the left  side
                                   of  the  frame and the left side of the DDS
                                   display window. Keep the default value,  0,
                                   to  have  MediaConvert automatically choose
                                   this offset. Related setting: When you  use
                                   this  setting, you must set DDS handling to
                                   a value other than None. MediaConvert  uses
                                   these  values to determine whether to write
                                   page position data to the  DDS  or  to  the
                                   page  composition  segment. All burn-in and
                                   DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                               DdsYCoordinate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting, along with DDS  x-coordi-
                                   nate,  to  specify the upper left corner of
                                   the display definition segment  (DDS)  dis-
                                   play window. With this setting, specify the
                                   distance, in pixels, between the top of the
                                   frame  and  the top of the DDS display win-
                                   dow. Keep the default value, 0, to have Me-
                                   diaConvert  automatically  choose this off-
                                   set. Related setting:  When  you  use  this
                                   setting,  you  must  set  DDS handling to a
                                   value other than  None.  MediaConvert  uses
                                   these  values to determine whether to write
                                   page position data to the  DDS  or  to  the
                                   page composition segment (PCS). All burn-in
                                   and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                               FallbackFont -> (string)
                                   Specify the font that you want the  service
                                   to  use for your burn in captions when your
                                   input captions specify a font  that  Media-
                                   Convert doesn't support. When you set Fall-
                                   back font to best match,  or  leave  blank,
                                   MediaConvert  uses  a  supported  font that
                                   most closely matches the font that your in-
                                   put captions specify. When there are multi-
                                   ple unsupported fonts in  your  input  cap-
                                   tions,  MediaConvert matches each font with
                                   the supported font that matches best.  When
                                   you  explicitly  choose a replacement font,
                                   MediaConvert uses that font to replace  all
                                   unsupported fonts from your input.

                               FontColor -> (string)
                                   Specify  the  color  of  the captions text.
                                   Leave  Font  color  blank  and  set   Style

                                   present.  Within  your job settings, all of
                                   your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               FontOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify the opacity of the  burned-in  cap-
                                   tions.  255  is  opaque;  0 is transparent.

                                   DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               FontResolution -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  Font  resolution in DPI (dots
                                   per inch). Within your job settings, all of
                                   your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               FontScript -> (string)
                                   Set  Font  script  to  Automatically deter-
                                   mined, or leave blank, to automatically de-

                                   tions. Otherwise, set to Simplified Chinese
                                   (HANS)  or  Traditional  Chinese  (HANT) if
                                   your input font script uses  Simplified  or
                                   Traditional  Chinese.  Within your job set-
                                   tings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must be
                                   identical.

                               FontSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the Font size in pixels. Must be a
                                   positive integer. Set to 0, or leave blank,
                                   for  automatic  font  size. Within your job
                                   settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must
                                   be identical.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the height, in pixels, of this set
                                   of DVB-Sub captions. The default  value  is
                                   576  pixels.  Related setting: When you use
                                   this setting, you must set DDS handling  to
                                   a  value  other  than None. All burn-in and
                                   DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                               HexFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore this setting unless your Font  color
                                   is  set  to  Hex. Enter either six or eight
                                   hexidecimal   digits,   representing   red,
                                   green,  and  blue,  with two optional extra
                                   digits for alpha. For example  a  value  of
                                   1122AABB  is  a  red value of 0x11, a green
                                   value of 0x22, a blue value of 0xAA, and an
                                   alpha value of 0xBB.

                               OutlineColor -> (string)
                                   Specify  font  outline color. Leave Outline

                                   from  your  input  captions,  if   present.
                                   Within  your  job  settings,  all  of  your
                                   DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               OutlineSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Outline  size  of  the  caption
                                   text,  in  pixels. Leave Outline size blank
                                   and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                                   the  outline size data from your input cap-
                                   tions, if present.  Within  your  job  set-

                                   Specify  the  width, in pixels, of this set
                                   of DVB-Sub captions. The default  value  is
                                   720  pixels.  Related setting: When you use
                                   this setting, you must set DDS handling  to
                                   a  value  other  than None. All burn-in and

                                   pixels.  A  value of 10 would result in the
                                   captions starting 10 pixels from the top of
                                   the  output.  If  no explicit y_position is
                                   provided, the caption  will  be  positioned
                                   towards  the  bottom  of the output. Within

                               StylePassthrough -> (string)
                                   To use the available style, color, and  po-
                                   sition  information  from  your  input cap-

                                   MediaConvert  uses  default  settings  when
                                   style and position information  is  missing
                                   from  your  input captions. To recreate the

                                   matically applies timing  adjustments,  in-
                                   cluding  adjustments for frame rate conver-
                                   sion, ad avails, and input  clipping.  Your
                                   input  captions  format  must be WebVTT. To
                                   ignore the style and  position  information
                                   from your input captions and use simplified
                                   output captions: Set Style  passthrough  to
                                   Disabled, or leave blank.

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  language  of  this  captions  output
                            track. For most captions output formats,  the  en-
                            coder puts this language information in the output
                            captions metadata. If your output captions  format
                            is  DVB-Sub or Burn in, the encoder uses this lan-
                            guage information to choose the font language  for
                            rendering the captions text.

                        LanguageDescription -> (string)
                            Specify  a  label for this set of output captions.
                            For example, "English", "Director commentary",  or
                            "track_2".  For  streaming  outputs,  MediaConvert
                            passes this information into destination manifests
                            for display on the end-viewer's player device. For
                            outputs in other output groups,  the  service  ig-
                            nores this setting.

                 ContainerSettings -> (structure)
                     Container specific settings.

                     CmfcSettings -> (structure)
                        These  settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container
                        for the segments in your CMAF outputs.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose Match video duration. In all  other  cases,
                            keep  the  default  value, Default codec duration.
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads  the  output  audio  streams  with silence or
                            trims them to ensure that the  total  duration  of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration of the video  stream.  After  padding  or
                            trimming,  the  audio  stream  duration is no more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only
                            to the end of the file. When you keep the  default
                            value,  any  minor discrepancies between audio and
                            video duration will depend on  your  output  audio
                            codec.

                        AudioGroupId -> (string)
                            Specify  the  audio rendition group for this audio
                            rendition. Specify up to one value for each  audio
                            output in your output group. This value appears in
                            your HLS parent manifest in the EXT-X-MEDIA tag of
                            TYPE=AUDIO,  as  the value for the GROUP-ID attri-
                            bute. For example, if  you  specify  "audio_aac_1"
                            for  Audio  group  ID, it appears in your manifest
                            like  this:  #EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="au-
                            dio_aac_1". Related setting: To associate the ren-
                            dition group that this audio track belongs to with
                            a video rendition, include the same value that you
                            provide here for that video output's setting Audio
                            rendition sets.

                        AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                            List  the audio rendition groups that you want in-
                            cluded with this video rendition. Use a comma-sep-
                            arated  list. For example, say you want to include
                            the audio rendition groups  that  have  the  audio
                            group  IDs  "audio_aac_1"  and "audio_dolby". Then
                            you would  specify  this  value:  "audio_aac_1,au-
                            dio_dolby".  Related setting: The rendition groups
                            that you  include  in  your  comma-separated  list
                            should  all  match  values that you specify in the
                            setting Audio group ID for audio renditions in the
                            same output group as this video rendition. Default
                            behavior: If you don't specify anything  here  and
                            for  Audio  group ID, MediaConvert puts each audio
                            variant in its own audio rendition group and asso-
                            ciates  it with every video variant. Each value in
                            your list appears in your HLS parent  manifest  in
                            the  EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value for the AU-
                            DIO attribute. To continue the  previous  example,
                            say  that the file name for the child manifest for
                            your video  rendition  is  "amazing_video_1.m3u8".
                            Then, in your parent manifest, each value will ap-
                            pear    on    separate    lines,    like     this:
                            #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_aac_1"...     amaz-
                            ing_video_1.m3u8      #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="au-
                            dio_dolby"... amazing_video_1.m3u8

                        AudioTrackType -> (string)
                            Use this setting to control the values that Media-
                            Convert puts in your HLS parent playlist  to  con-
                            trol  how  the  client  player selects which audio

                            you want to prohibit the client from playing  with
                            video.  This  causes MediaConvert to represent the
                            variant as an EXT-X-STREAM-INF in  the  HLS  mani-
                            fest. The other options for this setting determine
                            the values that MediaConvert writes  for  the  DE-

                            about  these  attributes, see the Apple documenta-
                            tion                                       article

                            Choose Alternate audio, auto  select,  default  to
                            set  DEFAULT=YES  and  AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this
                            value for only one variant in your  output  group.
                            Choose  Alternate  audio, auto select, not default
                            to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=YES.  Choose  Al-
                            ternate  Audio,  Not Auto Select to set DEFAULT=NO
                            and AUTOSELECT=NO. When you don't specify a  value
                            for  this setting, MediaConvert defaults to Alter-
                            nate audio, auto select, default.  When  there  is
                            more  than  one  variant in your output group, you
                            must explicitly choose a value for this setting.

                        DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                            Specify whether to flag this audio  track  as  de-
                            scriptive  video  service (DVS) in your HLS parent
                            manifest. When you choose Flag,  MediaConvert  in-
                            cludes  the  parameter CHARACTERISTICS="public.ac-
                            cessibility.describes-video"  in  the  EXT-X-MEDIA
                            entry  for  this  track. When you keep the default
                            choice, Don't flag, MediaConvert leaves  this  pa-
                            rameter  out.  The DVS flag can help with accessi-
                            bility on Apple devices. For more information, see
                            the Apple documentation.

                        IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                            Choose  Include  to  have MediaConvert generate an
                            HLS child manifest that lists  only  the  I-frames
                            for  this  rendition,  in addition to your regular
                            manifest for this rendition. You  might  use  this
                            manifest  as  part of a workflow that creates pre-
                            view functions for your video.  MediaConvert  adds
                            both the I-frame only child manifest and the regu-
                            lar child manifest to the  parent  manifest.  When
                            you  don't  need  the I-frame only child manifest,
                            keep the default value Exclude.

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To include key-length-value metadata in this  out-
                            put:  Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your
                            input and writes each instance to a separate event
                            message box  in  the  output,  according  to  MISB
                            ST1910.1.  To  exclude  this KLV metadata: Set KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                            To add an InbandEventStream element in your output
                            MPD  manifest  for each type of event message, set
                            Manifest metadata signaling to  Enabled.  For  ID3
                            event   messages,  the  InbandEventStream  element
                            schemeIdUri will be same value  that  you  specify
                            for  ID3  metadata scheme ID URI. For SCTE35 event
                            messages, the InbandEventStream  element  schemeI-
                            dUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave
                            these elements out of your  output  MPD  manifest,
                            set  Manifest  metadata  signaling to Disabled. To
                            enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must  also
                            set SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to
                            insert, or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                        Scte35Esam -> (string)
                            Use this setting only  when  you  specify  SCTE-35
                            markers  from  ESAM.  Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35
                            markers in this output  at  the  insertion  points
                            that  you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide
                            the document in the setting SCC XML.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35  mark-
                            ers  in  your input video file. Choose Passthrough
                            if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear  in  your
                            input  to  also appear in this output. Choose None
                            if you don't want those SCTE-35  markers  in  this
                            output.

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include  ID3  metadata in this output: Set ID3
                            metadata to Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata
                            in  Custom  ID3  metadata  inserter.  MediaConvert
                            writes each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate
                            Event  Message  (eMSG)  box.  To  exclude this ID3
                            metadata: Set ID3 metadata to None or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG)  version  for
                            ID3 timed metadata in your output. For more infor-

                            value Version 0. When you specify Version  1,  you
                            must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                        TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI
                            for ID3 timed metadata in your  output.  For  more
                            information,   see  ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section

                            you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                        TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3
                            timed metadata in your output. For  more  informa-

                     Container -> (string)
                        Container for this output. Some containers  require  a
                        container  settings  object. If not specified, the de-
                        fault object will be created.

                     F4vSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for F4v container

                        MoovPlacement -> (string)
                            To place the MOOV atom at the  beginning  of  your
                            output,  which is useful for progressive download-
                            ing: Leave blank or choose  Progressive  download.
                            To  place  the  MOOV  at  the  end of your output:
                            Choose Normal.

                     M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                        MPEG-2 TS container settings. These apply  to  outputs
                        in  a File output group when the output's container is
                        MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS). In these assets,  data
                        is  organized  by  the  program  map table (PMT). Each
                        transport stream program contains subsets of data, in-
                        cluding audio, video, and metadata. Each of these sub-
                        sets of data has a numerical  label  called  a  packet
                        identifier (PID). Each transport stream program corre-
                        sponds to one MediaConvert output. The PMT  lists  the
                        types of data in a program along with their PID. Down-
                        stream systems and players use the program  map  table
                        to  look  up the PID for each type of data it accesses
                        and then uses the PIDs to locate specific data  within
                        the asset.

                        AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                            Selects between the DVB and ATSC buffer models for
                            Dolby Digital audio.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose Match video duration. In all  other  cases,
                            keep  the  default  value, Default codec duration.
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads  the  output  audio  streams  with silence or
                            trims them to ensure that the  total  duration  of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration of the video  stream.  After  padding  or
                            trimming,  the  audio  stream  duration is no more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only
                            to the end of the file. When you keep the  default
                            value,  any  minor discrepancies between audio and
                            video duration will depend on  your  output  audio
                            codec.

                        AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                            The  number of audio frames to insert for each PES
                            packet.

                        AudioPids -> (list)
                            Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for any ele-
                            mentary  audio streams you include in this output.
                            Specify multiple PIDs as a JSON array. Default  is
                            the range 482-492.

                            (integer)

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify the output bitrate of the transport stream
                            in bits per second. Setting to 0  lets  the  muxer
                            automatically  determine  the appropriate bitrate.
                            Other common  values  are  3750000,  7500000,  and
                            15000000.

                        BufferModel -> (string)
                            Controls what buffer model to use for accurate in-
                            terleaving. If set  to  MULTIPLEX,  use  multiplex
                            buffer  model.  If  set  to NONE, this can lead to
                            lower latency, but low-memory devices may  not  be
                            able  to  play  back  the stream without interrup-
                            tions.

                        DataPTSControl -> (string)
                            If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert  writes
                            captions  and data packets with Presentation Time-
                            stamp (PTS) values greater than or  equal  to  the
                            first  video  packet  PTS (MediaConvert drops cap-
                            tions and data packets with  lesser  PTS  values).
                            Keep the default value to allow all PTS values.

                        DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  these settings to insert a DVB Network Infor-
                            mation Table (NIT) in the transport stream of this
                            output.

                            NetworkId -> (integer)
                               The  numeric value placed in the Network Infor-
                               mation Table (NIT).

                            NetworkName -> (string)
                               The  network  name  text  placed  in  the  net-
                               work_name_descriptor  inside the Network Infor-
                               mation Table. Maximum length is 256 characters.

                            NitInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                        DvbSdtSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  these  settings  to  insert a DVB Service De-
                            scription Table (SDT) in the transport  stream  of
                            this output.

                            OutputSdt -> (string)
                               Selects  method  of  inserting  SDT information
                               into output stream. "Follow input  SDT"  copies
                               SDT  information  from  input  stream to output
                               stream. "Follow input SDT  if  present"  copies
                               SDT  information  from  input  stream to output
                               stream if SDT information is present in the in-
                               put,   otherwise  it  will  fall  back  on  the
                               user-defined values. Enter "SDT Manually" means
                               user  will  enter the SDT information. "No SDT"
                               means output stream will not contain SDT infor-
                               mation.

                            SdtInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                            ServiceName -> (string)
                               The service name placed in the service_descrip-
                               tor  in  the Service Description Table. Maximum
                               length is 256 characters.

                            ServiceProviderName -> (string)
                               The service provider name placed  in  the  ser-
                               vice_descriptor  in the Service Description Ta-
                               ble. Maximum length is 256 characters.

                        DvbSubPids -> (list)
                            Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for DVB sub-
                            title data included in this output. Specify multi-
                            ple PIDs as a JSON array.  Default  is  the  range
                            460-479.

                            (integer)

                        DvbTdtSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  these  settings to insert a DVB Time and Date
                            Table (TDT) in the transport stream of  this  out-
                            put.

                            TdtInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                        DvbTeletextPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) for DVB  tele-
                            text  data  you include in this output. Default is
                            499.

                        EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                            When set to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS,  audio  EBP
                            markers  will  be added to partitions 3 and 4. The
                            interval between these additional markers will  be
                            fixed, and will be slightly shorter than the video
                            EBP marker interval. When set  to  VIDEO_INTERVAL,
                            these  additional  markers  will  not be inserted.
                            Only applicable when EBP segmentation markers  are
                            is   selected   (segmentationMarkers   is  EBP  or
                            EBP_LEGACY).

                        EbpPlacement -> (string)
                            Selects which PIDs to place EBP markers  on.  They
                            can  either be placed only on the video PID, or on
                            both the video PID and all audio PIDs. Only appli-
                            cable  when  EBP  segmentation  markers are is se-
                            lected (segmentationMarkers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                        EsRateInPes -> (string)
                            Controls whether to include the ES Rate  field  in
                            the PES header.

                        ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                            Keep  the  default value unless you know that your
                            audio EBP markers are incorrectly appearing before
                            your  video  EBP markers. To correct this problem,
                            set this value to Force.

                        FragmentTime -> (double)
                            The length, in seconds,  of  each  fragment.  Only
                            used with EBP markers.

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include key-length-value metadata in this out-
                            put: Set KLV metadata  insertion  to  Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert  reads  KLV  metadata present in your
                            input and passes it through to the  output  trans-
                            port stream. To exclude this KLV metadata: Set KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum time, in milliseconds, between
                            Program  Clock References (PCRs) inserted into the
                            transport stream.

                        MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                            When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary Points do
                            not  come  within  the  specified time interval of
                            each other by looking ahead at input video. If an-
                            other EBP is going to come in within the specified
                            time interval, the current EBP is not emitted, and
                            the segment is "stretched" to the next marker. The
                            lookahead value does not add latency to  the  sys-
                            tem.  The  Live Event must be configured elsewhere
                            to create sufficient latency to make the lookahead
                            accurate.

                        NielsenId3 -> (string)
                            If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones  for  media
                            tracking will be detected in the input  audio  and
                            an equivalent ID3 tag will be inserted in the out-
                            put.

                        NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                            Value in bits per second of extra null packets  to
                            insert into the transport stream. This can be used
                            if a downstream encryption system  requires  peri-
                            odic null packets.

                        PatInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  milliseconds between instances of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PcrControl -> (string)
                            When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program  Clock
                            Reference  value  is inserted for every Packetized
                            Elementary Stream (PES) header. This is  effective
                            only  when the PCR PID is the same as the video or
                            audio elementary stream.

                        PcrPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) for  the  pro-
                            gram  clock reference (PCR) in this output. If you
                            do not specify a value, the service will  use  the
                            value for Video PID.

                        PmtInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  number  of  milliseconds between in-
                            stances of the program map table (PMT) in the out-
                            put transport stream.

                        PmtPid -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) for the pro-
                            gram map table (PMT) itself. Default is 480.

                        PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the private
                            metadata stream. Default is 503.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Use  Program  number to specify the program number
                            used in the program map table (PMT) for this  out-
                            put. Default is 1. Program numbers and program map
                            tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport  stream  con-
                            tainers, used for organizing data.

                        PtsOffset -> (integer)
                            Manually  specify  the initial PTS offset, in sec-
                            onds, when you set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter an
                            integer  from  0  to 3600. Leave blank to keep the
                            default value 2.

                        PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                            Specify the initial presentation  timestamp  (PTS)
                            offset  for  your  transport stream output. To let
                            MediaConvert automatically determine  the  initial
                            PTS  offset: Keep the default value, Auto. We rec-
                            ommend that you choose Auto for the widest  player
                            compatibility.  The  initial  PTS will be at least
                            two seconds and vary depending  on  your  output's
                            bitrate,  HRD  buffer  size and HRD buffer initial
                            fill percentage. To manually  specify  an  initial
                            PTS  offset: Choose Seconds. Then specify the num-
                            ber of seconds with PTS offset.

                        RateMode -> (string)
                            When set to CBR, inserts null packets into  trans-
                            port stream to fill specified bitrate. When set to
                            VBR, the bitrate setting acts as the  maximum  bi-
                            trate,  but  the  output  will not be padded up to
                            that bitrate.

                        Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                            Include this in your job settings to  put  SCTE-35
                            markers  in  your HLS and transport stream outputs
                            at the insertion points that  you  specify  in  an
                            ESAM  XML  document.  Provide  the document in the
                            setting SCC XML.

                            Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                               Packet Identifier (PID) of the  SCTE-35  stream
                               in the transport stream generated by ESAM.

                        Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35
                            stream in the transport stream.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            For  SCTE-35  markers  from  your  input--  Choose
                            Passthrough  if  you want SCTE-35 markers that ap-
                            pear in your input to also appear in this  output.
                            Choose  None  if you don't want SCTE-35 markers in
                            this output. For SCTE-35 markers from an ESAM  XML
                            document--  Choose None. Also provide the ESAM XML
                            as a string in the setting Signal processing noti-
                            fication  XML.  Also  enable ESAM SCTE-35 (include
                            the property scte35Esam).

                        SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                            Inserts segmentation  markers  at  each  segmenta-
                            tion_time period. rai_segstart sets the Random Ac-
                            cess  Indicator  bit  in  the  adaptation   field.
                            rai_adapt  sets  the  RAI bit and adds the current
                            timecode in the private data  bytes.  psi_segstart
                            inserts  PAT  and  PMT tables at the start of seg-
                            ments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point information
                            to  the adaptation field as per OpenCable specifi-
                            cation OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118. ebp_legacy  adds  En-
                            coder Boundary Point information to the adaptation
                            field using a legacy proprietary format.

                        SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                            The segmentation style parameter controls how seg-
                            mentation  markers are inserted into the transport
                            stream. With avails, it is possible that  segments
                            may be truncated, which can influence where future
                            segmentation markers are inserted. When a  segmen-
                            tation  style of "reset_cadence" is selected and a
                            segment is truncated due to an avail, we will  re-
                            set  the segmentation cadence. This means the sub-
                            sequent segment will have a duration of  of  $seg-
                            mentation_time  seconds. When a segmentation style
                            of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is
                            truncated  due  to an avail, we will not reset the
                            segmentation cadence. This  means  the  subsequent
                            segment will likely be truncated as well. However,
                            all segments after that will have  a  duration  of
                            $segmentation_time  seconds.  Note  that EBP look-
                            ahead is a slight exception to this rule.

                        SegmentationTime -> (double)
                            Specify the length, in seconds, of  each  segment.
                            Required unless markers is set to _none_.

                        TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream
                            in the transport stream.

                        TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                            Specify the ID for the transport stream itself  in
                            the  program  map table for this output. Transport
                            stream IDs and program map  tables  are  parts  of
                            MPEG-2 transport stream containers, used for orga-
                            nizing data.

                        VideoPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the elemen-
                            tary video stream in the transport stream.

                     M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                        These  settings  relate to the MPEG-2 transport stream
                        (MPEG2-TS) container for the MPEG2-TS segments in your
                        HLS outputs.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is  sensitive  to  very small duration differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video duration. In all other cases,
                            keep the default value,  Default  codec  duration.
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads the output  audio  streams  with  silence  or
                            trims  them  to  ensure that the total duration of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration  of  the  video  stream. After padding or
                            trimming, the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                            to  the end of the file. When you keep the default
                            value, any minor discrepancies between  audio  and
                            video  duration  will  depend on your output audio
                            codec.

                        AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                            The number of audio frames to insert for each  PES
                            packet.

                        AudioPids -> (list)
                            Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of the elementary audio
                            stream(s) in the transport stream. Multiple values
                            are  accepted, and can be entered in ranges and/or
                            by comma separation.

                            (integer)

                        DataPTSControl -> (string)
                            If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert  writes
                            captions  and data packets with Presentation Time-
                            stamp (PTS) values greater than or  equal  to  the
                            first  video  packet  PTS (MediaConvert drops cap-
                            tions and data packets with  lesser  PTS  values).
                            Keep  the default value AUTO to allow all PTS val-
                            ues.

                        MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum time, in milliseconds, between
                            Program  Clock References (PCRs) inserted into the
                            transport stream.

                        NielsenId3 -> (string)
                            If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones  for  media
                            tracking  will  be detected in the input audio and
                            an equivalent ID3 tag will be inserted in the out-
                            put.

                        PatInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  milliseconds between instances of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PcrControl -> (string)
                            When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a  Program  Clock
                            Reference  value  is inserted for every Packetized
                            Elementary Stream (PES) header. This parameter  is
                            effective only when the PCR PID is the same as the
                            video or audio elementary stream.

                        PcrPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the Program Clock  Ref-
                            erence  (PCR)  in  the  transport  stream. When no
                            value is given, the encoder will assign  the  same
                            value as the Video PID.

                        PmtInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  milliseconds between instances of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PmtPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) for the Program Map  Table
                            (PMT) in the transport stream.

                        PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of the private metadata
                            stream in the transport stream.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            The value of the program number field in the  Pro-
                            gram Map Table.

                        PtsOffset -> (integer)
                            Manually  specify  the initial PTS offset, in sec-
                            onds, when you set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter an
                            integer  from  0  to 3600. Leave blank to keep the
                            default value 2.

                        PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                            Specify the initial presentation  timestamp  (PTS)
                            offset  for  your  transport stream output. To let
                            MediaConvert automatically determine  the  initial
                            PTS  offset: Keep the default value, Auto. We rec-
                            ommend that you choose Auto for the widest  player
                            compatibility.  The  initial  PTS will be at least
                            two seconds and vary depending  on  your  output's
                            bitrate,  HRD  buffer  size and HRD buffer initial
                            fill percentage. To manually  specify  an  initial
                            PTS  offset: Choose Seconds. Then specify the num-
                            ber of seconds with PTS offset.

                        Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35  stream  in
                            the transport stream.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            For  SCTE-35  markers  from  your  input--  Choose
                            Passthrough if you want SCTE-35 markers  that  ap-
                            pear  in your input to also appear in this output.
                            Choose None if you don't want SCTE-35  markers  in
                            this  output. For SCTE-35 markers from an ESAM XML
                            document-- Choose None if you don't want  manifest
                            conditioning.  Choose  Passthrough  and  choose Ad
                            markers if you do want manifest  conditioning.  In
                            both  cases, also provide the ESAM XML as a string
                            in the setting Signal processing notification XML.

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            Set ID3 metadata to  Passthrough  to  include  ID3
                            metadata  in  this output. This includes ID3 meta-
                            data from the following  features:  ID3  timestamp
                            period,  and  Custom ID3 metadata inserter. To ex-
                            clude this ID3 metadata in this  output:  set  ID3
                            metadata to None or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream
                            in the transport stream.

                        TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                            The value of the transport stream ID field in  the
                            Program Map Table.

                        VideoPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of the elementary video
                            stream in the transport stream.

                     MovSettings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to  your  QuickTime  MOV  output
                        container.

                        ClapAtom -> (string)
                            When  enabled,  include 'clap' atom if appropriate
                            for the video output settings.

                        CslgAtom -> (string)
                            When enabled, file composition times will start at
                            zero, composition times in the 'ctts' (composition
                            time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative,
                            and  a  'cslg'  (composition shift least greatest)
                            box will be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                            improves  compatibility  with  Apple  players  and
                            tools.

                        Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                            When set to XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video streams into
                            the  QuickTime file using XDCAM fourcc codes. This
                            increases compatibility  with  Apple  editors  and
                            players, but may decrease compatibility with other
                            players. Only applicable when the video  codec  is
                            MPEG2.

                        PaddingControl -> (string)
                            Unless you need Omneon compatibility: Keep the de-
                            fault value, None. To make this output  compatible
                            with Omneon: Choose Omneon. When you do, MediaCon-
                            vert increases the length of the 'elst' edit  list
                            atom.  Note  that this might cause file rejections
                            when a recipient of the output file doesn't expect
                            this extra padding.

                        Reference -> (string)
                            Always keep the default value (SELF_CONTAINED) for
                            this setting.

                     Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to your  MP4  output  container.
                        You can create audio only outputs with this container.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose Match video duration. In all  other  cases,
                            keep  the  default  value, Default codec duration.
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads  the  output  audio  streams  with silence or
                            trims them to ensure that the  total  duration  of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration of the video  stream.  After  padding  or
                            trimming,  the  audio  stream  duration is no more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only
                            to the end of the file. When you keep the  default
                            value,  any  minor discrepancies between audio and
                            video duration will depend on  your  output  audio
                            codec.

                        CslgAtom -> (string)
                            When enabled, file composition times will start at
                            zero, composition times in the 'ctts' (composition
                            time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative,
                            and a 'cslg' (composition  shift  least  greatest)
                            box will be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                            improves  compatibility  with  Apple  players  and
                            tools.

                        CttsVersion -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this setting unless compliance to the CTTS
                            box version specification matters  in  your  work-
                            flow.  Specify  a  value of 1 to set your CTTS box
                            version to 1 and make your output  compliant  with
                            the  specification. When you specify a value of 1,
                            you must also set CSLG atom to the value  INCLUDE.
                            Keep the default value 0 to set your CTTS box ver-
                            sion to 0. This can provide backward compatibility
                            for some players and packagers.

                        FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                            Inserts  a  free-space  box  immediately after the
                            moov box.

                        MoovPlacement -> (string)
                            To place the MOOV atom at the  beginning  of  your
                            output,  which is useful for progressive download-
                            ing: Leave blank or choose  Progressive  download.
                            To  place  the  MOOV  at  the  end of your output:
                            Choose Normal.

                        Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                            Overrides the "Major Brand" field  in  the  output
                            file. Usually not necessary to specify.

                     MpdSettings -> (structure)
                        These  settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container
                        for the segments in your DASH outputs.

                        AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                            Optional. Choose Include to have MediaConvert mark
                            up  your  DASH manifest with elements for embedded
                            608 captions.  This  markup  isn't  generally  re-
                            quired,  but some video players require it to dis-
                            cover and play embedded 608 captions. Keep the de-
                            fault value, Exclude, to leave these elements out.
                            When you enable this setting, this is  the  markup
                            that MediaConvert includes in your manifest:

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is  sensitive  to  very small duration differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video duration. In all other cases,
                            keep the default value,  Default  codec  duration.
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads the output  audio  streams  with  silence  or
                            trims  them  to  ensure that the total duration of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration  of  the  video  stream. After padding or
                            trimming, the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                            to  the end of the file. When you keep the default
                            value, any minor discrepancies between  audio  and
                            video  duration  will  depend on your output audio
                            codec.

                        CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                            Use this setting only in DASH output  groups  that
                            include sidecar TTML or IMSC captions. You specify
                            sidecar captions in a separate  output  from  your
                            audio and video. Choose Raw for captions in a sin-
                            gle XML file in a raw container. Choose Fragmented
                            MPEG-4 for captions in XML format contained within
                            fragmented MP4 files. This set of  fragmented  MP4
                            files  is separate from your video and audio frag-
                            mented MP4 files.

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To include key-length-value metadata in this  out-
                            put:  Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your
                            input and writes each instance to a separate event
                            message box  in  the  output,  according  to  MISB
                            ST1910.1.  To  exclude  this KLV metadata: Set KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                            To add an InbandEventStream element in your output
                            MPD  manifest  for each type of event message, set
                            Manifest metadata signaling to  Enabled.  For  ID3
                            event   messages,  the  InbandEventStream  element
                            schemeIdUri will be same value  that  you  specify
                            for  ID3  metadata scheme ID URI. For SCTE35 event
                            messages, the InbandEventStream  element  schemeI-
                            dUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave
                            these elements out of your  output  MPD  manifest,
                            set  Manifest  metadata  signaling to Disabled. To
                            enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must  also
                            set SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to
                            insert, or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                        Scte35Esam -> (string)
                            Use this setting only  when  you  specify  SCTE-35
                            markers  from  ESAM.  Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35
                            markers in this output  at  the  insertion  points
                            that  you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide
                            the document in the setting SCC XML.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35  mark-
                            ers  in  your input video file. Choose Passthrough
                            if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear  in  your
                            input  to  also appear in this output. Choose None
                            if you don't want those SCTE-35  markers  in  this
                            output.

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include  ID3  metadata in this output: Set ID3
                            metadata to Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata
                            in  Custom  ID3  metadata  inserter.  MediaConvert
                            writes each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate
                            Event  Message  (eMSG)  box.  To  exclude this ID3
                            metadata: Set ID3 metadata to None or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG)  version  for
                            ID3 timed metadata in your output. For more infor-

                     MxfSettings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to your MXF output container.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Optional. When you have AFD signaling  set  up  in
                            your  output  video  stream,  use  this setting to
                            choose whether to also include it in the MXF wrap-
                            per.  Choose  Don't  copy to exclude AFD signaling
                            from the  MXF  wrapper.  Choose  Copy  from  video
                            stream  to  copy  the  AFD  values  from the video
                            stream for this output to the MXF wrapper. Regard-

                        Profile -> (string)
                            Specify the MXF profile,  also  called  shim,  for
                            this output. To automatically select a profile ac-

                        XavcProfileSettings -> (structure)
                            Specify  the XAVC profile settings for MXF outputs
                            when you set your MXF profile to XAVC.

                            DurationMode -> (string)
                               To create an output that complies with the XAVC
                               file  format  guidelines  for interoperability,
                               keep the default value, Drop frames for compli-
                               ance.  To include all frames from your input in
                               this output, keep the  default  setting,  Allow
                               any  duration. The number of frames that Media-
                               Convert excludes when  you  set  this  to  Drop
                               frames  for  compliance  depends  on the output
                               frame rate and duration.

                            MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                               Specify a value for this setting only for  out-
                               puts that you set up with one of these two XAVC
                               profiles: XAVC HD Intra CBG or  XAVC  4K  Intra
                               CBG.  Specify the amount of space in each frame
                               that the service reserves for  ancillary  data,
                               such  as  teletext  captions. The default value
                               for this setting is 1492 bytes per frame.  This
                               should be sufficient to prevent overflow unless
                               you have multiple pages  of  teletext  captions
                               data.  If  you  have a large amount of teletext
                               data, specify a larger number.

                 VideoDescription -> (structure)
                     VideoDescription contains a group of video encoding  set-
                     tings.  The  specific  video settings depend on the video
                     codec that you choose for the property codec. Include one
                     instance of VideoDescription per output.

                     AfdSignaling -> (string)
                        This  setting  only applies to H.264, H.265, and MPEG2
                        outputs. Use Insert AFD signaling to  specify  whether
                        the  service  includes  AFD values in the output video
                        data and what those values are. * Choose None  to  re-
                        move  all  AFD values from this output. * Choose Fixed
                        to ignore input AFD  values  and  instead  encode  the
                        value specified in the job. * Choose Auto to calculate
                        output AFD values based on the input AFD scaler data.

                     AntiAlias -> (string)
                        The anti-alias filter is automatically applied to  all
                        outputs.  The service no longer accepts the value DIS-
                        ABLED for AntiAlias. If you specify that in your  job,
                        the service will ignore the setting.

                     CodecSettings -> (structure)
                        Video  codec  settings  contains the group of settings
                        related to video encoding. The settings in this  group
                        vary  depending on the value that you choose for Video
                        codec. For each codec enum that you choose, define the
                        corresponding settings object. The following lists the
                        codec enum, settings object pairs. * AV1,  Av1Settings

                            BitDepth -> (string)
                               Specify the Bit depth. You can choose 8-bit  or
                               10-bit.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               Use the Framerate setting to specify the  frame
                               rate  for  this output. If you want to keep the
                               same frame rate as the input video, choose Fol-
                               low  source.  If you want to do frame rate con-
                               version, choose a frame rate from the  dropdown
                               list  or choose Custom. The framerates shown in
                               the dropdown list are decimal approximations of
                               fractions.  If  you choose Custom, specify your
                               frame rate as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. For numerically simple conversions,  such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the default value, Drop duplicate. For  numeri-
                               cally  complex  conversions,  to avoid stutter:
                               Choose Interpolate. This results  in  a  smooth
                               picture,  but might introduce undesirable video
                               artifacts. For complex frame rate  conversions,
                               especially  if  your  source  video has already
                               been  converted  from  its  original   cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation. FrameFormer uses the best  conver-
                               sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note that using
                               FrameFormer increases the transcoding time  and
                               incurs  a  significant  add-on  cost.  When you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Specify  the  GOP length (keyframe interval) in
                               frames. With AV1, MediaConvert doesn't  support
                               GOP  length  in  seconds.  This  value  must be
                               greater than zero and preferably equal to  1  +
                               ((numberBFrames  + 1) * x), where x is an inte-
                               ger value.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify from the number  of  B-frames,  in  the
                               range  of  0-15. For AV1 encoding, we recommend
                               using 7 or 15. Choose a  larger  number  for  a
                               lower  bitrate  and smaller file size; choose a
                               smaller number for better video quality.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings for quality-defined  variable  bitrate
                               encoding  with  the H.265 codec. Use these set-
                               tings only when you set QVBR for  Rate  control
                               mode.

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control mode to QVBR.  Specify  the  target
                                   quality level for this output. MediaConvert
                                   determines the right number of bits to  use
                                   for  each part of the video to maintain the
                                   video quality that you  specify.  When  you
                                   keep  the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                   picks a quality level  for  you,  based  on
                                   characteristics of your input video. If you
                                   prefer to specify a quality level,  specify
                                   a number from 1 through 10. Use higher num-
                                   bers for greater quality. Level 10  results
                                   in nearly lossless compression. The quality
                                   level for most broadcast-quality transcodes
                                   is  between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify
                                   a value between whole numbers, also provide
                                   a   value   for   the   setting   qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional.  Specify  a value here to set the
                                   QVBR quality to a  level  that  is  between
                                   whole  numbers.  For  example,  if you want
                                   your QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,  set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est third of a whole number.  For  example,
                                   if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you
                                   set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               'With AV1 outputs, for rate control mode, Medi-
                               aConvert supports only quality-defined variable
                               bitrate (QVBR). You can''t use CBR or VBR.'

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Specify  the number of slices per picture. This
                               value must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.  For  pro-
                               gressive pictures, this value must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock rows.  For
                               interlaced  pictures,  this  value must be less
                               than or equal to half the number of  macroblock
                               rows.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default  value,  Enabled,  to adjust
                               quantization within each frame based on spatial
                               variation  of  content complexity. When you en-
                               able this feature, the encoder uses fewer  bits
                               on  areas that can sustain more distortion with
                               no noticeable visual degradation and uses  more
                               bits  on  areas where any small distortion will
                               be noticeable. For  example,  complex  textured
                               blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and smooth
                               textured blocks are encoded with more bits. En-
                               abling  this feature will almost always improve
                               your video quality.  Note,  though,  that  this
                               feature  doesn't  take  into  account where the
                               viewer's attention is likely to be. If  viewers
                               are  likely to be focusing their attention on a
                               part of the screen with a lot of  complex  tex-
                               ture, you might choose to disable this feature.

                               games, set it to Low. For content with a  wider

                               Optional  when you set AVC-Intra class to Class
                               4K/2K. When you set AVC-Intra class to  a  dif-
                               ferent value, this object isn't allowed.

                               QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                   Optional.   Use  Quality  tuning  level  to
                                   choose how many transcoding  passes  Media-
                                   Convert  does  with  your  video.  When you
                                   choose Multi-pass, your  video  quality  is
                                   better  and your output bitrate is more ac-
                                   curate. That is, the actual bitrate of your
                                   output  is closer to the target bitrate de-
                                   fined in the specification. When you choose
                                   Single-pass,  your encoding time is faster.
                                   The default behavior is Single-pass.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate.  For numerically simple conversions, such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the  default value, Drop duplicate. For numeri-
                               cally complex conversions,  to  avoid  stutter:
                               Choose  Interpolate.  This  results in a smooth
                               picture, but might introduce undesirable  video
                               artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                               especially if your  source  video  has  already
                               been   converted  from  its  original  cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation.  FrameFormer uses the best conver-
                               sion method frame by  frame.  Note  that  using
                               FrameFormer  increases the transcoding time and
                               incurs a  significant  add-on  cost.  When  you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose the scan line type for the output.  Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first to create  an  output  that's  interlaced
                               with  the  same  field polarity throughout. Use
                               Follow, default top or Follow,  default  bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as the source. For jobs that have multiple  in-
                               puts,  the  output  field polarity might change
                               over the course of the output. Follow  behavior
                               depends  on  the input scan type. If the source
                               is interlaced, the output  will  be  interlaced
                               with  the  same  polarity as the source. If the
                               source is progressive, the output will  be  in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending on which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                               choose.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting for interlaced outputs, when
                               your output frame rate is half  of  your  input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing to create a better  quality  inter-
                               laced  output.  In  this case, each progressive
                               frame from the input corresponds to  an  inter-
                               laced  field  in  the  output. Keep the default
                               value, Basic interlacing, for all other  output
                               frame  rates. With basic interlacing, MediaCon-
                               vert performs any frame rate  conversion  first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized interlacing and you set  your  output
                               frame  rate  to a value that isn't suitable for
                               optimized interlacing,  MediaConvert  automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings: To  use  optimized  interlacing,  you
                               must  set  Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't
                               use optimized  interlacing  for  hard  telecine
                               outputs.  You must also set Interlace mode to a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you  enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to  keep  it  synchronized with the video. Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the  duration of your video. Required settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable hard telecine to create a smoother
                               picture. When you keep the default value, None,
                               MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conver-
                               sion to 29.97 without doing anything  with  the
                               field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                        Codec -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  video codec. This must be equal to
                            one of the  enum  values  defined  by  the  object
                            VideoCodec.  To  passthrough  the  video stream of
                            your input  JPEG2000,  VC-3,  AVC-INTRA  or  Apple
                            ProRes  video  without  any video encoding: Choose
                            Passthrough. If you have  multiple  input  videos,
                            note  that  they  must have identical encoding at-
                            tributes. When you choose Passthrough, your output
                            container must be MXF or QuickTime MOV.

                        FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                            Required   when   you   set  Codec  to  the  value
                            FRAME_CAPTURE.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               Frame capture will encode the  first  frame  of
                               the output stream, then one frame every framer-
                               ateDenominator/framerateNumerator seconds.  For
                               example, settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and
                               framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of  1/3  frame
                               per  second) will capture the first frame, then
                               1 frame every 3s. Files will be named as  file-
                               name.n.jpg where n is the 0-based sequence num-
                               ber of each Capture.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               Frame capture will encode the  first  frame  of
                               the output stream, then one frame every framer-
                               ateDenominator/framerateNumerator seconds.  For
                               example, settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and
                               framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of  1/3  frame
                               per  second) will capture the first frame, then
                               1 frame every 3s. Files will be named as  file-
                               name.NNNNNNN.jpg  where  N is the 0-based frame
                               sequence  number  zero  padded  to  7   decimal
                               places.

                            MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                               Maximum  number of captures (encoded jpg output
                               files).

                            Quality -> (integer)
                               JPEG Quality - a  higher  value  equals  higher
                               quality.

                        H264Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value H_264.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the default value, Auto, for this setting
                               to have MediaConvert  automatically  apply  the
                               best  types of quantization for your video con-
                               tent. When you want to apply your  quantization
                               settings  manually,  you must set H264Adaptive-
                               Quantization to a value other  than  Auto.  Use
                               this  setting  to  specify  the strength of any
                               adaptive quantization filters that you  enable.
                               If  you don't want MediaConvert to do any adap-
                               tive quantization in this transcode, set  Adap-
                               tive quantization to Off. Related settings: The
                               value that you choose here applies to the  fol-

                            BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                               The  Bandwidth  reduction  filter increases the
                               video quality of your output  relative  to  its

                               Sharpening -> (string)
                                   Optionally  specify the level of sharpening
                                   to apply when you use the Bandwidth  reduc-
                                   tion  filter.  Sharpening  adds contrast to
                                   the edges of your video content and can re-
                                   duce  softness.  Keep the default value Off
                                   to  apply  no  sharpening.  Set  Sharpening
                                   strength  to  Low to apply a minimal amount
                                   of sharpening, or High to apply  a  maximum
                                   amount of sharpening.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Specify  the  strength of the Bandwidth re-
                                   duction filter. For most workflows, we rec-
                                   ommend  that  you choose Auto to reduce the
                                   bandwidth of your output with little to  no
                                   perceptual  decrease  in video quality. For
                                   high  quality  and  high  bitrate  outputs,
                                   choose  Low.  For the most bandwidth reduc-
                                   tion, choose High. We  recommend  that  you
                                   choose  High  for low bitrate outputs. Note
                                   that High may incur a  slight  increase  in
                                   the softness of your output.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               Required for VBR and CBR. For  MS  Smooth  out-
                               puts, bitrates must be unique when rounded down
                               to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                            CodecLevel -> (string)
                               Specify an H.264 level that is consistent  with
                               your  output video settings. If you aren't sure
                               what level to specify, choose Auto.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               H.264 Profile. High 4:2:2 and  10-bit  profiles
                               are only available with the AVC-I License.

                            DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                               Specify whether to allow the number of B-frames
                               in your output GOP structure to vary or not de-
                               pending on your input video content. To improve
                               the subjective video  quality  of  your  output
                               that  has  high-motion  content: Leave blank or
                               keep the default value  Adaptive.  MediaConvert
                               will  use  fewer B-frames for high-motion video
                               content than low-motion  content.  The  maximum
                               number  of  B-  frames  is limited by the value
                               that you choose for B-frames between  reference
                               frames. To use the same number B-frames for all
                               types of content: Choose Static.

                            EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                               Optionally include or suppress markers  at  the
                               end  of  your output that signal the end of the
                               video stream. To include end of stream markers:
                               Leave blank or keep the default value, Include.
                               To not include end of  stream  markers:  Choose
                               Suppress.  This is useful when your output will
                               be inserted into another stream.

                            EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                               Entropy encoding mode. Use CABAC  (must  be  in
                               Main or High profile) or CAVLC.

                            FieldEncoding -> (string)
                               The  video  encoding method for your MPEG-4 AVC
                               output. Keep the default value, PAFF,  to  have
                               MediaConvert  use  PAFF encoding for interlaced
                               outputs. Choose Force field to disable PAFF en-
                               coding  and  create separate interlaced fields.
                               Choose MBAFF to disable PAFF and have MediaCon-
                               vert use MBAFF encoding for interlaced outputs.

                            FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Only  use  this setting when you change the de-
                               fault value, AUTO, for  the  setting  H264Adap-
                               tiveQuantization.  When  you keep all defaults,
                               excluding  H264AdaptiveQuantization   and   all
                               other  adaptive quantization from your JSON job
                               specification, MediaConvert  automatically  ap-
                               plies  the  best types of quantization for your
                               video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuanti-
                               zation  to a value other than AUTO, the default
                               value  for  H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization  is
                               Disabled.  Change  this value to Enabled to re-
                               duce I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears as a vis-
                               ual  flicker  that  can  arise when the encoder
                               saves bits by  copying  some  macroblocks  many
                               times  from  frame to frame, and then refreshes
                               them at the I-frame. When you enable this  set-
                               ting,  the  encoder  updates  these macroblocks
                               slightly more often to smooth out the  flicker.
                               To  manually enable or disable H264FlickerAdap-
                               tiveQuantization, you must set Adaptive quanti-
                               zation to a value other than AUTO.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. For numerically simple conversions,  such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the default value, Drop duplicate. For  numeri-
                               cally  complex  conversions,  to avoid stutter:
                               Choose Interpolate. This results  in  a  smooth
                               picture,  but might introduce undesirable video
                               artifacts. For complex frame rate  conversions,
                               especially  if  your  source  video has already
                               been  converted  from  its  original   cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation. FrameFormer uses the best  conver-
                               sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note that using
                               FrameFormer increases the transcoding time  and
                               incurs  a  significant  add-on  cost.  When you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               Specify  whether to allow B-frames to be refer-
                               enced by other frame types.  To  use  reference
                               B-frames  when your GOP structure has 1 or more
                               B-frames: Leave blank or keep the default value
                               Enabled.  We  recommend that you choose Enabled
                               to help improve the video quality of your  out-
                               put  relative to its bitrate. To not use refer-
                               ence B-frames: Choose Disabled.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed  GOP,  set this value to 5. We recommend
                               that  you  have  the  transcoder  automatically
                               choose this value for you based on characteris-
                               tics of your input video. In  the  console,  do
                               this by keeping the default empty value. If you
                               do explicitly specify a  value,  for  segmented
                               outputs, don't set this value to 0.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when you set GOP mode
                               control to Specified, frames or Specified, sec-
                               onds. Specify the GOP length using a whole num-
                               ber of frames or a decimal  value  of  seconds.
                               MediaConvert   will  interpret  this  value  as
                               frames or seconds depending on  the  value  you
                               choose for GOP mode control. If you want to al-
                               low MediaConvert to automatically determine GOP
                               size,  leave  GOP  size  blank and set GOP mode
                               control to Auto. If your output group specifies
                               HLS,  DASH,  or  CMAF, leave GOP size blank and
                               set GOP mode control to Auto in each output  in
                               your output group.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify  how the transcoder determines GOP size
                               for this output. We recommend that you have the
                               transcoder  automatically choose this value for
                               you based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                               video.   To  enable  this  automatic  behavior,
                               choose Auto and and leave GOP  size  blank.  By
                               default, if you don't specify GOP mode control,
                               MediaConvert will use  automatic  behavior.  If
                               your output group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,
                               set GOP mode control to Auto and leave GOP size
                               blank  in  each output in your output group. To
                               explicitly specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                               ified,  frames  or  Specified, seconds and then
                               provide the GOP length in the  related  setting
                               GOP size.

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If  your  downstream systems have strict buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the  HRD  buffer that's available at the end of
                               each encoded video segment. For the best  video
                               quality:  Set  to 0 or leave blank to automati-
                               cally determine the final buffer fill  percent-
                               age.

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage  of the buffer that should initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first  to  create  an  output that's interlaced
                               with the same field  polarity  throughout.  Use
                               Follow,  default  top or Follow, default bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as  the source. For jobs that have multiple in-
                               puts, the output field  polarity  might  change
                               over  the course of the output. Follow behavior
                               depends on the input scan type. If  the  source
                               is  interlaced,  the  output will be interlaced
                               with the same polarity as the  source.  If  the
                               source  is  progressive, the output will be in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending  on  which  of  the  Follow options you
                               choose.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use this setting  only  when  you  also  enable
                               Scene change detection. This setting determines
                               how the encoder  manages  the  spacing  between
                               I-frames that it inserts as part of the I-frame
                               cadence and the I-frames that  it  inserts  for
                               Scene  change  detection. We recommend that you
                               have the transcoder automatically  choose  this
                               value  for you based on characteristics of your
                               input video. To enable this automatic behavior,
                               do  this  by  keeping  the default empty value.
                               When you explicitly specify a  value  for  this
                               setting, the encoder determines whether to skip
                               a cadence-driven I-frame by the value you  set.
                               For example, if you set Min I interval to 5 and
                               a cadence-driven I-frame would  fall  within  5
                               frames  of a scene-change I-frame, then the en-
                               coder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this
                               way,  one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is
                               stretched  slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven
                               I-frames  are  farther  from  the  scene-change
                               I-frame than the value you set,  then  the  en-
                               coder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs
                               surrounding the scene change are  smaller  than
                               the usual cadence GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  number of B-frames between refer-
                               ence frames in this output. For the best  video
                               quality:  Leave  blank.  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally determines the number of B-frames to  use
                               based  on  the  characteristics  of  your input
                               video.  To  manually  specify  the  number   of
                               B-frames between reference frames: Enter an in-
                               teger from 0 to 7.

                            NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Number of reference frames to use. The  encoder
                               may  use  more than requested if using B-frames
                               and/or interlaced encoding.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow source,  uses  the
                               PAR  from  your input video for your output. To
                               specify a different PAR in the console,  choose
                               any  value  other  than Follow source. When you
                               choose SPECIFIED for  this  setting,  you  must
                               also  specify  values  for the parNumerator and
                               parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               The Quality tuning level you choose  represents
                               a  trade-off between the encoding speed of your
                               job and  the  output  video  quality.  For  the
                               fastest  encoding  speed  at  the cost of video
                               quality: Choose Single pass. For a good balance
                               between encoding speed and video quality: Leave
                               blank or keep the default value Single pass HQ.
                               For  the best video quality, at the cost of en-
                               coding speed: Choose Multi pass  HQ.  MediaCon-
                               vert  performs  an  analysis pass on your input
                               followed by an encoding pass. Outputs that  use
                               this feature incur pro-tier pricing.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  for  quality-defined variable bitrate
                               encoding with the H.265 codec. Use  these  set-
                               tings  only  when you set QVBR for Rate control
                               mode.

                               MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting  only  when  Rate  control
                                   mode  is  QVBR  and Quality tuning level is
                                   Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate val-
                                   ues  suited to the complexity of your input
                                   video, the service limits the  average  bi-
                                   trate  of  the video part of this output to
                                   the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                                   tal  size of the video element is less than
                                   or equal to the value you set multiplied by
                                   the number of seconds of encoded output.

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control mode to QVBR.  Specify  the  target
                                   quality level for this output. MediaConvert
                                   determines the right number of bits to  use
                                   for  each part of the video to maintain the
                                   video quality that you  specify.  When  you
                                   keep  the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                   picks a quality level  for  you,  based  on
                                   characteristics of your input video. If you
                                   prefer to specify a quality level,  specify
                                   a number from 1 through 10. Use higher num-
                                   bers for greater quality. Level 10  results
                                   in nearly lossless compression. The quality
                                   level for most broadcast-quality transcodes
                                   is  between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify
                                   a value between whole numbers, also provide
                                   a   value   for   the   setting   qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional.  Specify  a value here to set the
                                   QVBR quality to a  level  that  is  between
                                   whole  numbers.  For  example,  if you want
                                   your QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,  set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est third of a whole number.  For  example,
                                   if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you
                                   set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting to specify whether this output
                               has a variable bitrate (VBR), constant  bitrate

                            RepeatPps -> (string)
                               Places a PPS header on  each  encoded  picture,
                               even if repeated.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting for interlaced outputs, when
                               your output frame rate is half  of  your  input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing to create a better  quality  inter-
                               laced  output.  In  this case, each progressive
                               frame from the input corresponds to  an  inter-
                               laced  field  in  the  output. Keep the default
                               value, Basic interlacing, for all other  output
                               frame  rates. With basic interlacing, MediaCon-
                               vert performs any frame rate  conversion  first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized interlacing and you set  your  output
                               frame  rate  to a value that isn't suitable for
                               optimized interlacing,  MediaConvert  automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings: To  use  optimized  interlacing,  you
                               must  set  Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't
                               use optimized  interlacing  for  hard  telecine
                               outputs.  You must also set Interlace mode to a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)

                               This improves video quality and is  enabled  by
                               default. If this output uses QVBR, choose Tran-
                               sition detection for further video quality  im-

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-
                               laced pictures.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels  the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to keep it synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the duration of your video. Required  settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore  this  setting unless you need to comply
                               with a specification that requires  a  specific
                               value.  If  you  don't have a specification re-
                               quirement, we recommend  that  you  adjust  the
                               softness  of your output by using a lower value
                               for the setting  Sharpness  or  by  enabling  a
                               noise  reducer  filter.  The  Softness  setting
                               specifies the quantization  matrices  that  the
                               encoder  uses.  Keep  the default value, 0, for
                               flat quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16  to
                               use  the default JVT softening quantization ma-
                               tricies from the H.264 specification. Choose  a
                               value  from  17 to 128 to use planar interpola-
                               tion. Increasing values from 17 to  128  result
                               in increasing reduction of high-frequency data.
                               The value 128 results in the softest video.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Only use this setting when you change  the  de-

                               tiveQuantization. When you keep  all  defaults,
                               excluding   H264AdaptiveQuantization   and  all

                               video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuanti-
                               zation to a value other than AUTO, the  default
                               value  for  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization  is
                               Enabled. Keep  this  default  value  to  adjust
                               quantization within each frame based on spatial
                               variation of content complexity. When  you  en-
                               able  this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                               on areas that can sustain more distortion  with
                               no  noticeable visual degradation and uses more
                               bits on areas where any small  distortion  will
                               be  noticeable.  For  example, complex textured
                               blocks are encoded with fewer bits  and  smooth
                               textured blocks are encoded with more bits. En-

                               your  video  quality.  Note,  though, that this
                               feature doesn't take  into  account  where  the
                               viewer's  attention is likely to be. If viewers
                               are likely to be focusing their attention on  a

                               frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and  your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally enable hard or soft telecine to  create  a
                               smoother  picture.  Hard  telecine  produces  a
                               29.97i output. Soft telecine produces an output
                               with  a 23.976 output that signals to the video

                                   strength  to  Low to apply a minimal amount
                                   of sharpening, or High to apply  a  maximum
                                   amount of sharpening.

                               Strength -> (string)

                                   choose  High  for low bitrate outputs. Note
                                   that High may incur a  slight  increase  in

                               that  has  high-motion  content: Leave blank or
                               keep the default value  Adaptive.  MediaConvert
                               will  use  fewer B-frames for high-motion video
                               content than low-motion  content.  The  maximum
                               number  of  B-  frames  is limited by the value
                               that you choose for B-frames between  reference
                               frames. To use the same number B-frames for all
                               types of content: Choose Static.

                            EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                               Optionally include or suppress markers  at  the
                               end  of  your output that signal the end of the
                               video stream. To include end of stream markers:
                               Leave blank or keep the default value, Include.
                               To not include end of  stream  markers:  Choose
                               Suppress.  This is useful when your output will
                               be inserted into another stream.

                            FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to have the encoder  reduce
                               I-frame  pop.  I-frame  pop appears as a visual
                               flicker that can arise when the  encoder  saves
                               bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks many times
                               from frame to frame, and then refreshes them at
                               the  I-frame. When you enable this setting, the
                               encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more
                               often  to  smooth out the flicker. This setting
                               is disabled by default. Related setting: In ad-
                               dition  to enabling this setting, you must also
                               set adaptiveQuantization to a value other  than
                               Off.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               Use  the Framerate setting to specify the frame
                               rate for this output. If you want to  keep  the
                               same frame rate as the input video, choose Fol-
                               low source. If you want to do frame  rate  con-
                               version,  choose a frame rate from the dropdown
                               list or choose Custom. The framerates shown  in
                               the dropdown list are decimal approximations of
                               fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify  your
                               frame rate as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate.  For numerically simple conversions, such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the  default value, Drop duplicate. For numeri-
                               cally complex conversions,  to  avoid  stutter:
                               Choose  Interpolate.  This  results in a smooth
                               picture, but might introduce undesirable  video
                               artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                               especially if your  source  video  has  already
                               been   converted  from  its  original  cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation.  FrameFormer uses the best conver-
                               sion method frame by  frame.  Note  that  using
                               FrameFormer  increases the transcoding time and
                               incurs a  significant  add-on  cost.  When  you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               Specify whether to allow B-frames to be  refer-
                               enced  by  other  frame types. To use reference
                               B-frames when your GOP structure has 1 or  more
                               B-frames: Leave blank or keep the default value
                               Enabled. We recommend that you  choose  Enabled
                               to  help improve the video quality of your out-
                               put relative to its bitrate. To not use  refer-
                               ence B-frames: Choose Disabled.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We  recommend
                               that  you  have  the  transcoder  automatically
                               choose this value for you based on characteris-
                               tics  of your input video. To enable this auto-
                               matic behavior, do this by keeping the  default
                               empty  value.  If  you  do explicitly specify a
                               value, for segmented outputs,  don't  set  this
                               value to 0.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when you set GOP mode
                               control to Specified, frames or Specified, sec-
                               onds. Specify the GOP length using a whole num-
                               ber of frames or a decimal  value  of  seconds.
                               MediaConvert   will  interpret  this  value  as
                               frames or seconds depending on  the  value  you
                               choose for GOP mode control. If you want to al-
                               low MediaConvert to automatically determine GOP
                               size,  leave  GOP  size  blank and set GOP mode
                               control to Auto. If your output group specifies
                               HLS,  DASH,  or  CMAF, leave GOP size blank and
                               set GOP mode control to Auto in each output  in
                               your output group.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify  how the transcoder determines GOP size
                               for this output. We recommend that you have the
                               transcoder  automatically choose this value for
                               you based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                               video.   To  enable  this  automatic  behavior,
                               choose Auto and and leave GOP  size  blank.  By
                               default, if you don't specify GOP mode control,
                               MediaConvert will use  automatic  behavior.  If
                               your output group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,
                               set GOP mode control to Auto and leave GOP size
                               blank  in  each output in your output group. To
                               explicitly specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                               ified,  frames  or  Specified, seconds and then
                               provide the GOP length in the  related  setting
                               GOP size.

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If  your  downstream systems have strict buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the  HRD  buffer that's available at the end of
                               each encoded video segment. For the best  video

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage  of the buffer that should initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first  to  create  an  output that's interlaced
                               with the same field  polarity  throughout.  Use
                               Follow,  default  top or Follow, default bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as  the source. For jobs that have multiple in-
                               puts, the output field  polarity  might  change
                               over  the course of the output. Follow behavior
                               depends on the input scan type. If  the  source
                               is  interlaced,  the  output will be interlaced
                               with the same polarity as the  source.  If  the
                               source  is  progressive, the output will be in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending  on  which  of  the  Follow options you
                               choose.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use this setting  only  when  you  also  enable
                               Scene change detection. This setting determines
                               how the encoder  manages  the  spacing  between
                               I-frames that it inserts as part of the I-frame
                               cadence and the I-frames that  it  inserts  for
                               Scene  change  detection. We recommend that you
                               have the transcoder automatically  choose  this
                               value  for you based on characteristics of your
                               input video. To enable this automatic behavior,
                               do  this  by  keeping  the default empty value.
                               When you explicitly specify a  value  for  this
                               setting, the encoder determines whether to skip
                               a cadence-driven I-frame by the value you  set.
                               For example, if you set Min I interval to 5 and
                               a cadence-driven I-frame would  fall  within  5
                               frames  of a scene-change I-frame, then the en-
                               coder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this
                               way,  one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is
                               stretched  slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven
                               I-frames  are  farther  from  the  scene-change
                               I-frame than the value you set,  then  the  en-
                               coder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs
                               surrounding the scene change are  smaller  than
                               the usual cadence GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  number of B-frames between refer-
                               ence frames in this output. For the best  video
                               quality:  Leave  blank.  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally determines the number of B-frames to  use
                               based  on  the  characteristics  of  your input
                               video.  To  manually  specify  the  number   of
                               B-frames between reference frames: Enter an in-
                               teger from 0 to 7.

                            NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Number of reference frames to use. The  encoder
                               may  use  more than requested if using B-frames
                               and/or interlaced encoding.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow source,  uses  the
                               PAR  from  your input video for your output. To
                               specify a different PAR, choose any value other
                               than  Follow  source. When you choose SPECIFIED
                               for this setting, you must also specify  values
                               for  the  parNumerator  and parDenominator set-
                               tings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning  level  to  choose
                               how  you  want  to trade off encoding speed for
                               output video quality. The default  behavior  is
                               faster, lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  for  quality-defined variable bitrate
                               encoding with the H.265 codec. Use  these  set-
                               tings  only  when you set QVBR for Rate control
                               mode.

                               MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting  only  when  Rate  control
                                   mode  is  QVBR  and Quality tuning level is
                                   Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate val-
                                   ues  suited to the complexity of your input
                                   video, the service limits the  average  bi-
                                   trate  of  the video part of this output to
                                   the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                                   tal  size of the video element is less than
                                   or equal to the value you set multiplied by
                                   the number of seconds of encoded output.

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control mode to QVBR.  Specify  the  target
                                   quality level for this output. MediaConvert
                                   determines the right number of bits to  use
                                   for  each part of the video to maintain the
                                   video quality that you  specify.  When  you
                                   keep  the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                   picks a quality level  for  you,  based  on
                                   characteristics of your input video. If you
                                   prefer to specify a quality level,  specify
                                   a number from 1 through 10. Use higher num-
                                   bers for greater quality. Level 10  results
                                   in nearly lossless compression. The quality
                                   level for most broadcast-quality transcodes
                                   is  between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify
                                   a value between whole numbers, also provide
                                   a   value   for   the   setting   qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional.  Specify  a value here to set the
                                   QVBR quality to a  level  that  is  between
                                   whole  numbers.  For  example,  if you want
                                   your QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,  set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est third of a whole number.  For  example,
                                   if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you
                                   set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting to specify whether this output
                               has a variable bitrate (VBR), constant  bitrate
                               (CBR)   or   quality-defined  variable  bitrate
                               (QVBR).

                            SampleAdaptiveOffsetFilterMode -> (string)
                               Specify Sample  Adaptive  Offset  (SAO)  filter
                               strength.  Adaptive  mode  dynamically  selects
                               best strength based on content

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  to  create a better quality inter-
                               laced output. In this  case,  each  progressive
                               frame  from  the input corresponds to an inter-
                               laced field in the  output.  Keep  the  default
                               value,  Basic interlacing, for all other output
                               frame rates. With basic interlacing,  MediaCon-
                               vert  performs  any frame rate conversion first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized  interlacing  and you set your output
                               frame rate to a value that isn't  suitable  for
                               optimized  interlacing,  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings:  To  use  optimized  interlacing, you
                               must set Telecine to None or  Soft.  You  can't
                               use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard telecine
                               outputs. You must also set Interlace mode to  a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene
                               changes that the service automatically detects.
                               This  improves  video quality and is enabled by
                               default. If this output uses QVBR, choose Tran-
                               sition  detection for further video quality im-
                               provement. For more information about QVBR, see

                            Slices -> (integer)

                               or  equal  to the number of macroblock rows for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half  the  number of macroblock rows for inter-
                               laced pictures.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you  enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to  keep  it  synchronized with the video. Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the  duration of your video. Required settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the  default  value,  Enabled,  to  adjust
                               quantization within each frame based on spatial
                               variation of content complexity. When  you  en-
                               able  this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                               on areas that can sustain more distortion  with
                               no  noticeable visual degradation and uses more
                               bits on areas where any small  distortion  will
                               be  noticeable.  For  example, complex textured
                               blocks are encoded with fewer bits  and  smooth
                               textured blocks are encoded with more bits. En-
                               abling this feature will almost always  improve
                               your  video  quality.  Note,  though, that this
                               feature doesn't take  into  account  where  the
                               viewer's  attention is likely to be. If viewers
                               are likely to be focusing their attention on  a
                               part  of  the screen with a lot of complex tex-
                               ture, you might choose to disable this feature.
                               Related  setting: When you enable spatial adap-
                               tive quantization, set the value  for  Adaptive
                               quantization depending on your content. For ho-

                               games,  set it to Low. For content with a wider
                               variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

                            Telecine -> (string)

                               - Soft: produces 23.976;  the  player  converts
                               this output to 29.97i.

                            TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default  value,  Enabled,  to adjust
                               quantization within each frame based on  tempo-
                               ral  variation  of content complexity. When you
                               enable this feature,  the  encoder  uses  fewer
                               bits  on  areas of the frame that aren't moving
                               and uses more  bits  on  complex  objects  with
                               sharp  edges that move a lot. For example, this
                               feature improves the readability of text  tick-
                               ers  on  newscasts  and  scoreboards  on sports
                               matches. Enabling this feature will almost  al-
                               ways  improve your video quality. Note, though,
                               that this feature  doesn't  take  into  account
                               where  the  viewer's attention is likely to be.

                               disable this feature. Related setting: When you
                               enable   temporal   quantization,   adjust  the

                            TemporalIds -> (string)
                               Enables  temporal  layer identifiers in the en-
                               coded bitstream. Up to 3 layers  are  supported
                               depending  on  GOP  structure:  I- and P-frames
                               form one layer, reference B-frames can  form  a
                               second  layer  and  non-reference  b-frames can
                               form a third layer. Decoders can optionally de-
                               code only the lower temporal layers to generate
                               a lower frame rate output. For example, given a
                               bitstream with temporal IDs and with b-frames =
                               1 (i.e. IbPbPb display order), a decoder  could
                               decode  all the frames for full frame rate out-
                               put or only the I and P frames (lowest temporal
                               layer) for a half frame rate output.

                            WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                               If the location  of  parameter  set  NAL  units
                               doesn't  matter  in  your workflow, ignore this
                               setting. Use this setting  only  with  CMAF  or
                               DASH  outputs,  or with standalone file outputs
                               in an MPEG-4 container  (MP4  outputs).  Choose
                               HVC1  to  mark  your output as HVC1. This makes
                               your output compliant with the following speci-
                               fication:  ISO IECJTC1 SC29 N13798 Text ISO/IEC
                               FDIS 14496-15 3rd Edition. For  these  outputs,
                               the  service  stores parameter set NAL units in
                               the sample headers but not in the  samples  di-
                               rectly.  For MP4 outputs, when you choose HVC1,
                               your output video might not work properly  with
                               some  downstream systems and video players. The
                               service defaults  to  marking  your  output  as
                               HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes pa-
                               rameter set NAL units directly  into  the  sam-
                               ples.

                        Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value MPEG2.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Specify  the strength of any adaptive quantiza-
                               tion filters that you enable.  The  value  that
                               you  choose  here applies to the following set-
                               tings: Spatial adaptive quantization, and  Tem-
                               poral adaptive quantization.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               Required for VBR and CBR. For  MS  Smooth  out-
                               puts, bitrates must be unique when rounded down
                               to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                            CodecLevel -> (string)
                               Use Level to set the MPEG-2 level for the video
                               output.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               Use  Profile  to set the MPEG-2 profile for the

                            DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                               Choose Adaptive  to  improve  subjective  video
                               quality  for  high-motion  content.  This  will
                               cause the service to use fewer B-frames  (which
                               infer  information  based  on other frames) for
                               high-motion portions  of  the  video  and  more
                               B-frames  for  low-motion portions. The maximum
                               number of B-frames is limited by the value  you
                               provide for the setting B frames between refer-
                               ence frames.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate.  For numerically simple conversions, such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the  default value, Drop duplicate. For numeri-
                               cally complex conversions,  to  avoid  stutter:
                               Choose  Interpolate.  This  results in a smooth
                               picture, but might introduce undesirable  video
                               artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                               especially if your  source  video  has  already
                               been   converted  from  its  original  cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation.  FrameFormer uses the best conver-
                               sion method frame by  frame.  Note  that  using
                               FrameFormer  increases the transcoding time and
                               incurs a  significant  add-on  cost.  When  you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed  GOP, set this value to 5. When you cre-
                               ate a streaming output, we recommend  that  you
                               keep  the  default  value,  1,  so that players
                               starting mid-stream receive  an  IDR  frame  as
                               quickly as possible. Don't set this value to 0;
                               that would break output segmenting.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Specify the interval between keyframes, in sec-
                               onds  or  frames,  for this output. Default: 12
                               Related settings: When you specify the GOP size
                               in  seconds, set GOP mode control to Specified,
                               seconds. The default value for GOP mode control
                               is Frames.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify  the  units  for GOP size. If you don't
                               specify a value here, by  default  the  encoder
                               measures GOP size in frames.

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If  your  downstream systems have strict buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the  HRD  buffer that's available at the end of
                               each encoded video segment. For the best  video
                               quality:  Set  to 0 or leave blank to automati-
                               cally determine the final buffer fill  percent-
                               age.

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage  of the buffer that should initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first  to  create  an  output that's interlaced
                               with the same field  polarity  throughout.  Use
                               Follow,  default  top or Follow, default bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as  the source. For jobs that have multiple in-
                               puts, the output field  polarity  might  change
                               over  the course of the output. Follow behavior
                               depends on the input scan type. If  the  source
                               is  interlaced,  the  output will be interlaced
                               with the same polarity as the  source.  If  the
                               source  is  progressive, the output will be in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending  on  which  of  the  Follow options you
                               choose.

                            IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                               Use Intra DC precision to set quantization pre-
                               cision  for intra-block DC coefficients. If you
                               choose the value auto, the service  will  auto-
                               matically  select  the  precision  based on the
                               per-frame compression ratio.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when  you also enable
                               Scene change detection. This setting determines
                               how  the  encoder  manages  the spacing between
                               I-frames that it inserts as part of the I-frame
                               cadence  and  the  I-frames that it inserts for
                               Scene change  detection.  When  you  specify  a
                               value  for this setting, the encoder determines
                               whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by the
                               value  you  set.  For example, if you set Min I
                               interval to  5  and  a  cadence-driven  I-frame
                               would  fall  within  5 frames of a scene-change
                               I-frame,  then  the  encoder  skips   the   ca-
                               dence-driven  I-frame.  In this way, one GOP is
                               shrunk  slightly  and  one  GOP  is   stretched
                               slightly.  When the cadence-driven I-frames are
                               farther from the scene-change I-frame than  the
                               value  you  set,  then  the  encoder leaves all
                               I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding  the
                               scene change are smaller than the usual cadence
                               GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify the number of B-frames  that  MediaCon-
                               vert puts between reference frames in this out-
                               put. Valid values  are  whole  numbers  from  0
                               through  7. When you don't specify a value, Me-
                               diaConvert defaults to 2.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow source,  uses  the
                               PAR  from  your input video for your output. To
                               specify a different PAR in the console,  choose
                               any  value  other  than Follow source. When you
                               choose SPECIFIED for  this  setting,  you  must
                               also  specify  values  for the parNumerator and
                               parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning  level  to  choose
                               how  you  want  to trade off encoding speed for
                               output video quality. The default  behavior  is
                               faster, lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use  Rate  control  mode to specify whether the
                               bitrate is variable (vbr) or constant (cbr).

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  to  create a better quality inter-
                               laced output. In this  case,  each  progressive
                               frame  from  the input corresponds to an inter-
                               laced field in the  output.  Keep  the  default
                               value,  Basic interlacing, for all other output
                               frame rates. With basic interlacing,  MediaCon-
                               vert  performs  any frame rate conversion first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized  interlacing  and you set your output
                               frame rate to a value that isn't  suitable  for
                               optimized  interlacing,  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings:  To  use  optimized  interlacing, you
                               must set Telecine to None or  Soft.  You  can't
                               use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard telecine
                               outputs. You must also set Interlace mode to  a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene
                               changes that the service automatically detects.
                               This  improves  video quality and is enabled by
                               default.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you  enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to  keep  it  synchronized with the video. Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the  duration of your video. Required settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore this setting unless you need  to  comply
                               with  a  specification that requires a specific
                               value. If you don't have  a  specification  re-
                               quirement,  we  recommend  that  you adjust the
                               softness of your output by using a lower  value
                               for  the  setting  Sharpness  or  by enabling a
                               noise  reducer  filter.  The  Softness  setting
                               specifies  the  quantization  matrices that the
                               encoder uses. Keep the default value, 0, to use
                               the  AWS  Elemental  default matrices. Choose a
                               value from 17 to 128 to use  planar  interpola-
                               tion.  Increasing  values from 17 to 128 result
                               in increasing reduction of high-frequency data.
                               The value 128 results in the softest video.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default  value,  Enabled,  to adjust
                               quantization within each frame based on spatial
                               variation  of  content complexity. When you en-
                               able this feature, the encoder uses fewer  bits
                               on  areas that can sustain more distortion with
                               no noticeable visual degradation and uses  more

                               be noticeable. For  example,  complex  textured
                               blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and smooth
                               textured blocks are encoded with more bits. En-

                               your video quality.  Note,  though,  that  this
                               feature  doesn't  take  into  account where the
                               viewer's attention is likely to be. If  viewers
                               are  likely to be focusing their attention on a
                               part of the screen with a lot of  complex  tex-
                               ture, you might choose to disable this feature.

                               tive  quantization,  set the value for Adaptive
                               quantization depending on your content. For ho-
                               mogeneous  content,  such as cartoons and video
                               games, set it to Low. For content with a  wider

                            Syntax -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  this  output's video uses the
                               D10 syntax. Keep the default value to  not  use
                               the  syntax.  Related settings: When you choose
                               D10 for your MXF profile,  you  must  also  set
                               this value to D10.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When  you  do frame rate conversion from 23.976
                               frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and  your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally enable hard or soft telecine to  create  a
                               smoother  picture.  Hard  telecine  produces  a
                               29.97i output. Soft telecine produces an output
                               with  a 23.976 output that signals to the video

                               MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conver-
                               sion  to  29.97 without doing anything with the
                               field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                            TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the  default  value,  Enabled,  to  adjust
                               quantization  within each frame based on tempo-
                               ral variation of content complexity.  When  you
                               enable  this  feature,  the  encoder uses fewer
                               bits on areas of the frame that  aren't  moving
                               and  uses  more  bits  on  complex objects with
                               sharp edges that move a lot. For example,  this
                               feature  improves the readability of text tick-
                               ers on  newscasts  and  scoreboards  on  sports
                               matches.  Enabling this feature will almost al-
                               ways improve your video quality. Note,  though,
                               that  this  feature  doesn't  take into account
                               where the viewer's attention is likely  to  be.
                               If  viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                               tention on a part of the  screen  that  doesn't

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. For numerically simple conversions,  such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the default value, Drop duplicate. For  numeri-
                               cally  complex  conversions,  to avoid stutter:
                               Choose Interpolate. This results  in  a  smooth
                               picture,  but might introduce undesirable video
                               artifacts. For complex frame rate  conversions,
                               especially  if  your  source  video has already
                               been  converted  from  its  original   cadence:

                               terpolation. FrameFormer uses the best  conver-
                               sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note that using
                               FrameFormer increases the transcoding time  and
                               incurs  a  significant  add-on  cost.  When you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first  to  create  an  output that's interlaced
                               with the same field  polarity  throughout.  Use
                               Follow,  default  top or Follow, default bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as  the source. For jobs that have multiple in-
                               puts, the output field  polarity  might  change
                               over  the course of the output. Follow behavior
                               depends on the input scan type. If  the  source
                               is  interlaced,  the  output will be interlaced
                               with the same polarity as the  source.  If  the
                               source  is  progressive, the output will be in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending  on  which  of  the  Follow options you
                               choose.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow source,  uses  the
                               PAR  from  your input video for your output. To
                               specify a different PAR, choose any value other
                               than  Follow  source. When you choose SPECIFIED
                               for this setting, you must also specify  values
                               for  the  parNumerator  and parDenominator set-
                               tings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  to  create a better quality inter-
                               laced output. In this  case,  each  progressive
                               frame  from  the input corresponds to an inter-

                               value,  Basic interlacing, for all other output
                               frame rates. With basic interlacing,  MediaCon-
                               vert  performs  any frame rate conversion first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized  interlacing  and you set your output
                               frame rate to a value that isn't  suitable  for
                               optimized  interlacing,  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings:  To  use  optimized  interlacing, you
                               must set Telecine to None or  Soft.  You  can't
                               use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard telecine
                               outputs. You must also set Interlace mode to  a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels  the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to keep it synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the duration of your video. Required  settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When  you  do frame rate conversion from 23.976
                               frames per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and  your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-

                               picture. When you keep the default value, None,
                               MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conver-
                               sion  to  29.97 without doing anything with the
                               field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               Use the Framerate setting to specify the  frame
                               rate  for  this output. If you want to keep the
                               same frame rate as the input video, choose Fol-
                               low  source.  If you want to do frame rate con-
                               version, choose a frame rate from the  dropdown
                               list  or choose Custom. The framerates shown in
                               the dropdown list are decimal approximations of
                               fractions.  If  you choose Custom, specify your
                               frame rate as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. For numerically simple conversions,  such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the default value, Drop duplicate. For  numeri-
                               cally  complex  conversions,  to avoid stutter:
                               Choose Interpolate. This results  in  a  smooth
                               picture,  but might introduce undesirable video
                               artifacts. For complex frame rate  conversions,
                               especially  if  your  source  video has already
                               been  converted  from  its  original   cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation. FrameFormer uses the best  conver-
                               sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note that using
                               FrameFormer increases the transcoding time  and
                               incurs  a  significant  add-on  cost.  When you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that

                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-

                               Optional.  Choose  the  scan line type for this
                               output. If you don't specify a value, MediaCon-
                               vert will create a progressive output.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting for interlaced outputs, when
                               your output frame rate is half  of  your  input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing to create a better  quality  inter-
                               laced  output.  In  this case, each progressive
                               frame from the input corresponds to  an  inter-
                               laced  field  in  the  output. Keep the default
                               value, Basic interlacing, for all other  output

                               Optimized interlacing and you set  your  output
                               frame  rate  to a value that isn't suitable for
                               optimized interlacing,  MediaConvert  automati-

                               vert will create a progressive output.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  to  create a better quality inter-
                               laced output. In this  case,  each  progressive
                               frame  from  the input corresponds to an inter-
                               laced field in the  output.  Keep  the  default
                               value,  Basic interlacing, for all other output
                               frame rates. With basic interlacing,  MediaCon-
                               vert  performs  any frame rate conversion first
                               and then interlaces the frames. When you choose
                               Optimized  interlacing  and you set your output
                               frame rate to a value that isn't  suitable  for
                               optimized  interlacing,  MediaConvert automati-
                               cally falls back to basic interlacing. Required
                               settings:  To  use  optimized  interlacing, you
                               must set Telecine to None or  Soft.  You  can't
                               use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard telecine
                               outputs. You must also set Interlace mode to  a
                               value other than Progressive.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable  slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output by
                               relabeling the video frames and resampling your
                               audio.  Note  that  enabling  this setting will
                               slightly reduce the duration of your video. Re-
                               lated  settings: You must also set Framerate to
                               25.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable hard telecine to create a smoother
                               picture. When you keep the default value, None,
                               MediaConvert does a standard frame rate conver-
                               sion to 29.97 without doing anything  with  the
                               field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                            Vc3Class -> (string)
                               Specify  the  VC3  class  to choose the quality
                               characteristics for this output. VC3 class, to-
                               gether  with  the  settings  Framerate (framer-
                               ateNumerator and framerateDenominator) and Res-
                               olution (height and width), determine your out-
                               put bitrate. For example, say that  your  video
                               resolution  is  1920x1080 and your framerate is
                               29.97. Then Class 145 gives you an output  with
                               a  bitrate  of approximately 145 Mbps and Class
                               220 gives you and output with a bitrate of  ap-
                               proximately  220 Mbps. VC3 class also specifies
                               the color bit depth of your output.

                        Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value VP8.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, en-
                               ter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. For numerically simple conversions,  such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the default value, Drop duplicate. For  numeri-
                               cally  complex  conversions,  to avoid stutter:
                               Choose Interpolate. This results  in  a  smooth
                               picture,  but might introduce undesirable video
                               artifacts. For complex frame rate  conversions,
                               especially  if  your  source  video has already
                               been  converted  from  its  original   cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation. FrameFormer uses the best  conver-
                               sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note that using
                               FrameFormer increases the transcoding time  and
                               incurs  a  significant  add-on  cost.  When you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must
                               be greater than zero.

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer model)  in
                               bits.  For  example,  enter  five  megabits  as
                               5000000.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Ignore this setting unless you set  qualityTun-
                               ingLevel  to  MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the
                               maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. The
                               default behavior uses twice the target  bitrate
                               as the maximum bitrate.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  how  the service determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for  this  output.
                               The  default  behavior, Follow source, uses the
                               PAR from your input video for your  output.  To
                               specify  a different PAR in the console, choose
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               choose  SPECIFIED  for  this  setting, you must
                               also specify values for  the  parNumerator  and
                               parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required  when  you  set  Pixel aspect ratio to
                               SPECIFIED. On the console, this corresponds  to
                               any  value  other  than Follow source. When you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your output PAR as a ratio.  For  example,  for
                               D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you would specify the
                               ratio 40:33. In this  example,  the  value  for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required  when  you  set  Pixel aspect ratio to
                               SPECIFIED. On the console, this corresponds  to
                               any  value  other  than Follow source. When you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your output PAR as a ratio.  For  example,  for
                               D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you would specify the
                               ratio 40:33. In this  example,  the  value  for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional.  Use  Quality  tuning level to choose
                               how you want to trade off  encoding  speed  for
                               output  video  quality. The default behavior is
                               faster, lower quality, multi-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               With the VP8 codec, you can use only the  vari-
                               able bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                        Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value VP9.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, en-
                               ter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as a fraction.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate.  For numerically simple conversions, such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the  default value, Drop duplicate. For numeri-
                               cally complex conversions,  to  avoid  stutter:
                               Choose  Interpolate.  This  results in a smooth

                               artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                               especially if your  source  video  has  already
                               been   converted  from  its  original  cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation.  FrameFormer uses the best conver-
                               sion method frame by  frame.  Note  that  using
                               FrameFormer  increases the transcoding time and
                               incurs a  significant  add-on  cost.  When  you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP Length (keyframe interval) in frames.  Must
                               be greater than zero.

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size  of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Ignore this setting unless you set  qualityTun-
                               ingLevel  to  MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the
                               maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. The
                               default behavior uses twice the target  bitrate
                               as the maximum bitrate.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  how  the service determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio for this output. The de-
                               fault  behavior is to use the same pixel aspect
                               ratio as your input video.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set  Pixel  aspect  ratio  to
                               SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corresponds to
                               any value other than Follow  source.  When  you
                               specify an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that
                               is different from your input video PAR, provide
                               your  output  PAR  as a ratio. For example, for
                               D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify  the
                               ratio  40:33.  In  this  example, the value for
                               parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning  level  to  choose
                               how  you  want  to trade off encoding speed for
                               output video quality. The default  behavior  is
                               faster, lower quality, multi-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               With  the VP9 codec, you can use only the vari-
                               able bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                        XavcSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value XAVC.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the default value, Auto, for this  setting
                               to  have  MediaConvert  automatically apply the
                               best types of quantization for your video  con-
                               tent.  When you want to apply your quantization
                               settings manually, you must set Adaptive  quan-
                               tization  to  a value other than Auto. Use this
                               setting to specify the strength of any adaptive
                               quantization  filters  that  you enable. If you
                               don't want  MediaConvert  to  do  any  adaptive
                               quantization  in  this  transcode, set Adaptive
                               quantization  to  Off.  Related  settings:  The
                               value  that you choose here applies to the fol-
                               lowing settings: Flicker adaptive  quantization
                               (flickerAdaptiveQuantization), Spatial adaptive
                               quantization, and Temporal  adaptive  quantiza-
                               tion.

                            EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                               Optional.  Choose  a  specific entropy encoding
                               mode only when you want to override XAVC recom-
                               mendations. If you choose the value auto, Medi-
                               aConvert uses the mode that the XAVC file  for-
                               mat  specifies  given  this  output's operating
                               point.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the  console,  use  the  Frame
                               rate setting to specify the frame rate for this
                               output. If you want to keep the same frame rate
                               as  the  input  video, choose Follow source. If
                               you want to do frame rate conversion, choose  a
                               frame  rate from the dropdown list. The framer-
                               ates shown in the dropdown list are decimal ap-
                               proximations of fractions.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate.  For numerically simple conversions, such
                               as 60 fps to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep
                               the  default value, Drop duplicate. For numeri-
                               cally complex conversions,  to  avoid  stutter:
                               Choose  Interpolate.  This  results in a smooth
                               picture, but might introduce undesirable  video
                               artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                               especially if your  source  video  has  already
                               been   converted  from  its  original  cadence:
                               Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated in-
                               terpolation.  FrameFormer uses the best conver-
                               sion method frame by  frame.  Note  that  using
                               FrameFormer  increases the transcoding time and
                               incurs a  significant  add-on  cost.  When  you
                               choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution
                               must be at least 128x96.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for  Frame  rate.
                               In this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               Specify the XAVC profile for this  output.  For
                               more information, see the Sony documentation at
                               https://www.xavc-info.org/. Note that MediaCon-
                               vert  doesn't support the interlaced video XAVC
                               operating points for XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG. To cre-
                               ate  an interlaced XAVC output, choose the pro-
                               file XAVC_HD.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25  fps  output  by
                               relabeling the video frames and resampling your
                               audio. Note that  enabling  this  setting  will
                               slightly reduce the duration of your video. Re-
                               lated settings: You must also set Frame rate to
                               25.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your  downstream
                               workflow requires that you specify  it  explic-
                               itly.  Otherwise,  we recommend that you adjust
                               the softness of your output by  using  a  lower
                               value  for the setting Sharpness or by enabling
                               a noise reducer filter.  The  Softness  setting
                               specifies  the  quantization  matrices that the
                               encoder uses. Keep the default  value,  0,  for
                               flat  quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16 to
                               use the default JVT softening quantization  ma-
                               tricies  from the H.264 specification. Choose a
                               value from 17 to 128 to use  planar  interpola-
                               tion.  Increasing  values from 17 to 128 result
                               in increasing reduction of high-frequency data.
                               The value 128 results in the softest video.

                               this setting in  your  JSON  job  specification
                               only  when  you  choose  to  change the default
                               value for Adaptive quantization. For this  set-

                               spatial  variation  of content complexity. When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits  on areas that can sustain more distortion
                               with no noticeable visual degradation and  uses
                               more  bits  on areas where any small distortion
                               will be noticeable. For example,  complex  tex-
                               tured  blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and
                               smooth textured blocks are  encoded  with  more
                               bits.  Enabling this feature will almost always
                               improve your video quality. Note, though,  that
                               this  feature  doesn't  take into account where
                               the viewer's attention  is  likely  to  be.  If

                               and video games, set it  to  Low.  For  content
                               with  a  wider  variety  of textures, set it to
                               High or Higher.

                                   to  have  the  encoder  reduce I-frame pop.
                                   I-frame pop appears  as  a  visual  flicker
                                   that  can arise when the encoder saves bits
                                   by copying some macroblocks many times from
                                   frame  to frame, and then refreshes them at
                                   the I-frame. When you enable this  setting,
                                   the   encoder   updates  these  macroblocks
                                   slightly  more  often  to  smooth  out  the
                                   flicker.  This  setting  is disabled by de-

                                   set to 1 so a  decoder  joining  mid-stream
                                   will  receive  an  IDR  frame as quickly as
                                   possible. Setting  this  value  to  0  will

                                   this  output.  Specify  this value in bits;
                                   for  example,  enter   five   megabits   as
                                   5000000.  When you don't set this value, or
                                   you set it to zero, MediaConvert calculates
                                   the default by doubling the bitrate of this

                                   I-frame pop appears  as  a  visual  flicker
                                   that  can arise when the encoder saves bits
                                   by copying some macroblocks many times from
                                   frame  to frame, and then refreshes them at
                                   the I-frame. When you enable this  setting,
                                   the   encoder   updates  these  macroblocks
                                   slightly  more  often  to  smooth  out  the
                                   flicker.  This  setting  is disabled by de-
                                   fault. Related setting: In addition to  en-
                                   abling  this  setting,  you  must  also set
                                   Adaptive quantization to a value other than
                                   Off  or  Auto. Use Adaptive quantization to
                                   adjust the degree of smoothing that Flicker
                                   adaptive quantization provides.

                               GopBReference -> (string)
                                   Specify  whether  the encoder uses B-frames
                                   as reference frames for other  pictures  in
                                   the same GOP. Choose Allow to allow the en-
                                   coder to use B-frames as reference  frames.
                                   Choose  Don't  allow to prevent the encoder
                                   from using B-frames as reference frames.

                               GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                   Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming  ap-
                                   plications,  it is recommended that this be
                                   set to 1 so a  decoder  joining  mid-stream
                                   will  receive  an  IDR  frame as quickly as
                                   possible. Setting  this  value  to  0  will
                                   break output segmenting.

                               HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the size of the buffer that Media-
                                   Convert uses in the HRD  buffer  model  for
                                   this  output.  Specify  this value in bits;
                                   for  example,  enter   five   megabits   as
                                   5000000.  When you don't set this value, or
                                   you set it to zero, MediaConvert calculates
                                   the default by doubling the bitrate of this
                                   output point.

                               InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                   Choose the scan line type for  the  output.
                                   Keep the default value, Progressive to cre-
                                   ate a progressive output, regardless of the
                                   scan  type  of  your  input.  Use Top field
                                   first or Bottom field first  to  create  an
                                   output  that's  interlaced  with  the  same
                                   field polarity throughout. Use Follow,  de-
                                   fault top or Follow, default bottom to pro-
                                   duce outputs with the same  field  polarity
                                   as  the source. For jobs that have multiple
                                   inputs, the  output  field  polarity  might
                                   change  over the course of the output. Fol-
                                   low behavior  depends  on  the  input  scan
                                   type. If the source is interlaced, the out-
                                   put will be interlaced with the same polar-
                                   ity  as  the  source. If the source is pro-
                                   gressive, the  output  will  be  interlaced
                                   with  top field bottom field first, depend-
                                   ing on which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                   choose.

                               QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                   Optional.   Use  Quality  tuning  level  to
                                   choose how you want to trade  off  encoding
                                   speed for output video quality. The default
                                   behavior is  faster,  lower  quality,  sin-
                                   gle-pass encoding.

                               Slices -> (integer)
                                   Number  of slices per picture. Must be less
                                   than or equal to the number  of  macroblock
                                   rows  for  progressive  pictures,  and less
                                   than or equal to half the  number  of  mac-
                                   roblock rows for interlaced pictures.

                               Telecine -> (string)
                                   Ignore  this  setting  unless you set Frame
                                   rate (framerateNumerator divided by framer-
                                   ateDenominator)  to  29.970.  If your input
                                   framerate is 23.976,  choose  Hard.  Other-
                                   wise, keep the default value None. For more
                                   information,                            see

                     ColorMetadata -> (string)
                        Choose Insert for this setting to include color  meta-
                        data  in  this  output. Choose Ignore to exclude color
                        metadata from this output.  If  you  don't  specify  a
                        value, the service sets this to Insert by default.

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use  Cropping selection to specify the video area that
                        the service will include in the output video frame.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                        Applies only to 29.97 fps outputs. When  this  feature
                        is  enabled,  the service will use drop-frame timecode
                        on outputs. If it is not possible  to  use  drop-frame
                        timecode, the system will fall back to non-drop-frame.
                        This setting is enabled by default when  Timecode  in-
                        sertion is enabled.

                     FixedAfd -> (integer)
                        Applies  only  if  you set AFD Signaling to Fixed. Use
                        Fixed to specify a four-bit AFD value which  the  ser-
                        vice will write on all frames of this video output.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Use  Height  to define the video resolution height, in
                        pixels, for this output. To use the same resolution as
                        your  input:  Leave  both  Width  and Height blank. To
                        evenly scale from your input resolution: Leave  Height
                        blank  and  enter  a  value for Width. For example, if
                        your input is 1920x1080 and you  set  Width  to  1280,
                        your output will be 1280x720.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use  Selection  placement  to define the video area in
                        your output frame. The area outside of  the  rectangle
                        that you specify here is black.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     RespondToAfd -> (string)
                        Use  Respond to AFD to specify how the service changes
                        the video itself in response to AFD values in the  in-
                        put.  *  Choose  Respond to clip the input video frame
                        according to the AFD value, input display  aspect  ra-
                        tio,   and  output  display  aspect  ratio.  *  Choose
                        Passthrough to include the input AFD  values.  Do  not
                        choose  this  when AfdSignaling is set to NONE. A pre-
                        ferred implementation of this workflow is to  set  Re-
                        spondToAfd  to  and set AfdSignaling to AUTO. * Choose
                        None to remove all input AFD values from this output.

                     ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                        Specify the video Scaling behavior  when  your  output
                        has  a  different resolution than your input. For more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-scaling.html

                     Sharpness -> (integer)
                        Use Sharpness  setting  to  specify  the  strength  of
                        anti-aliasing.  This  setting changes the width of the
                        anti-alias filter kernel used for  scaling.  Sharpness
                        only  applies  if  your output resolution is different
                        from your input resolution. 0 is the softest  setting,
                        100 the sharpest, and 50 recommended for most content.

                     TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                        Applies  only  to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes out-
                        puts. Only enable Timecode insertion  when  the  input
                        frame  rate  is identical to the output frame rate. To
                        include timecodes in this output, set Timecode  inser-
                        tion  to  PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out, set it to
                        DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When  the  service  in-
                        serts  timecodes in an output, by default, it uses any
                        embedded  timecodes  from  the  input.  If  none   are
                        present,  the  service  will  set the timecode for the
                        first output frame to zero. To change this default be-
                        havior,  adjust the settings under Timecode configura-
                        tion. In the console, these settings are located under
                        Job  >  Job  settings > Timecode configuration. Note -
                        Timecode source under input settings does  not  affect
                        the  timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source
                        under Job settings > Timecode configuration does.

                     VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)
                        Find additional transcoding features under  Preproces-
                        sors. Enable the features at each output individually.
                        These features are disabled by default.

                        ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to convert the color  space  or
                            to  modify properties such as hue and contrast for
                            this   output.   For   more    information,    see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/converting-the-color-space.html.

                            Brightness -> (integer)
                               Brightness level.

                            ClipLimits -> (structure)
                               Specify YUV limits and RGB tolerances when  you
                               set  Sample  range  conversion to Limited range
                               clip.

                               MaximumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Maximum RGB color sample  range

                               rated  areas  of  your  output. HDR to SDR tone
                               mapping has no effect when your input is SDR.

                            Hue -> (integer)
                               Hue in degrees.

                            MaxLuminance -> (integer)
                               Specify the  maximum  mastering  display  lumi-
                               nance.  Enter  an integer from 0 to 2147483647,
                               in units of 0.0001  nits.  For  example,  enter
                               10000000 for 1000 nits.

                            SampleRangeConversion -> (string)
                               Specify  how MediaConvert limits the color sam-
                               ple range for this output. To create a  limited
                               range  output  from  a full range input: Choose
                               Limited range squeeze. For full  range  inputs,
                               MediaConvert  performs a linear offset to color
                               samples equally across all pixels  and  frames.
                               Color  samples in 10-bit outputs are limited to
                               64 through 940, and 8-bit outputs  are  limited
                               to  16 through 235. Note: For limited range in-
                               puts,  values  for  color  samples  are  passed
                               through  to your output unchanged. MediaConvert
                               does not limit the  sample  range.  To  correct
                               pixels  in  your input that are out of range or
                               out of gamut: Choose Limited  range  clip.  Use
                               for  broadcast  applications. MediaConvert con-
                               forms any pixels outside of the values that you
                               specify  under  Minimum  YUV and Maximum YUV to
                               limited range bounds.  MediaConvert  also  cor-
                               rects  any  YUV  values that, when converted to
                               RGB, would be outside the  bounds  you  specify
                               under  Minimum  RGB  tolerance  and Maximum RGB
                               tolerance. With either  limited  range  conver-
                               sion,  MediaConvert  writes  the  sample  range
                               metadata in the output.

                            Saturation -> (integer)
                               Saturation level.

                            SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                               Specify the reference white level, in nits, for
                               all  of your SDR inputs. Use to correct bright-
                               ness levels within HDR10 outputs. The following
                               color  metadata must be present in your SDR in-
                               put: color primaries, transfer characteristics,
                               and  matrix coefficients. If your SDR input has
                               missing color metadata, or if you want to  cor-
                               rect  input  color metadata, manually specify a
                               color space in the input  video  selector.  For
                               1,000  nit  peak brightness displays, we recom-
                               mend that you set SDR reference white level  to
                               203  (according  to ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank
                               to use the default value of 100, or specify  an
                               integer from 100 to 1000.

                        Deinterlacer -> (structure)
                            Use  the  deinterlacer  to produce smoother motion
                            and a clearer picture. For more  information,  see

                            Algorithm -> (string)
                               Only applies when you set Deinterlace  mode  to
                               Deinterlace  or  Adaptive. Interpolate produces
                               sharper pictures, while blend produces smoother
                               motion.  If your source file includes a ticker,
                               such as a scrolling headline at the  bottom  of
                               the  frame:  Choose Interpolate ticker or Blend
                               ticker. To apply field doubling: Choose  Linear
                               interpolation.  Note  that Linear interpolation
                               may introduce video artifacts into your output.

                            Control -> (string)

                               o When set to NORMAL  (default),  the  deinter-
                                 lacer does not convert frames that are tagged
                                 in metadata as progressive. It will only con-
                                 vert  those  that  are  tagged  as some other
                                 type. - When  set  to  FORCE_ALL_FRAMES,  the
                                 deinterlacer converts every frame to progres-
                                 sive - even those that are already tagged  as
                                 progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there
                                 is a good chance that the metadata has tagged
                                 frames  as progressive when they are not pro-
                                 gressive. Do not turn on otherwise;  process-
                                 ing  frames that are already progressive into
                                 progressive will  probably  result  in  lower
                                 quality video.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               Use Deinterlacer to choose how the service will
                               do deinterlacing.  Default  is  Deinterlace.  -
                               Deinterlace converts interlaced to progressive.
                               -  Inverse  telecine  converts  Hard   Telecine
                               29.97i   to  progressive  23.976p.  -  Adaptive
                               auto-detects and converts to progressive.

                        DolbyVision -> (structure)
                            Enable Dolby Vision feature to produce  Dolby  Vi-
                            sion compatible video output.

                            L6Metadata -> (structure)
                               Use  these  settings  when you set DolbyVision-
                               Level6Mode to SPECIFY to  override  the  MaxCLL
                               and  MaxFALL values in your input with new val-
                               ues.

                               MaxCll -> (integer)
                                   Maximum Content  Light  Level.  Static  HDR
                                   metadata  that corresponds to the brightest
                                   pixel in the  entire  stream.  Measured  in
                                   nits.

                               MaxFall -> (integer)
                                   Maximum  Frame-Average  Light Level. Static
                                   HDR metadata that corresponds to the  high-
                                   est  frame-average brightness in the entire
                                   stream. Measured in nits.

                            L6Mode -> (string)
                               Use Dolby Vision Mode to choose how the service
                               will  handle  Dolby  Vision  MaxCLL and MaxFALL
                               properies.

                            Mapping -> (string)
                               Required when you set Dolby Vision  Profile  to
                               Profile  8.1.  When  you set Content mapping to
                               None, content mapping is  not  applied  to  the
                               HDR10-compatible   signal.   Depending  on  the
                               source peak nit level, clipping might occur  on
                               HDR  devices without Dolby Vision. When you set
                               Content mapping to HDR10 1000,  the  transcoder
                               creates a 1,000 nits peak HDR10-compatible sig-
                               nal by applying static content mapping  to  the
                               source.  This  mode is speed-optimized for PQ10
                               sources with  metadata  that  is  created  from
                               analysis.  For  graded Dolby Vision content, be
                               aware that creative intent might not be guaran-
                               teed with extreme 1,000 nits trims.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               Required when you enable Dolby Vision. Use Pro-
                               file 5 to include frame-interleaved  Dolby  Vi-
                               sion  metadata  in your output. Your input must
                               include Dolby Vision metadata or an  HDR10  YUV
                               color   space.   Use  Profile  8.1  to  include
                               frame-interleaved  Dolby  Vision  metadata  and
                               HDR10  metadata in your output. Your input must
                               include Dolby Vision metadata.

                        Hdr10Plus -> (structure)
                            Enable HDR10+  analysis  and  metadata  injection.
                            Compatible with HEVC only.

                            MasteringMonitorNits -> (integer)
                               Specify the HDR10+ mastering display normalized
                               peak luminance, in nits. This is the normalized
                               actual peak luminance of the mastering display,
                               as defined by ST 2094-40.

                            TargetMonitorNits -> (integer)
                               Specify the HDR10+ target display nominal  peak
                               luminance, in nits. This is the nominal maximum
                               luminance of the target display as  defined  by
                               ST 2094-40.

                        ImageInserter -> (structure)
                            Enable  the  Image  inserter  feature to include a
                            graphic overlay on your video. Enable  or  disable
                            this  feature  for  each output individually. This
                            setting is disabled by default.

                            InsertableImages -> (list)
                               Specify the images that you want to overlay  on
                               your  video.  The  images  must  be  PNG or TGA
                               files.

                               (structure)
                                   These settings apply to a specific  graphic
                                   overlay.  You can include multiple overlays
                                   in your job.

                                   Duration -> (integer)
                                      Specify the time, in  milliseconds,  for
                                      the image to remain on the output video.
                                      This duration includes fade-in time  but
                                      not fade-out time.

                                   FadeIn -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds, between the Start  time  that  you
                                      specify  for the image insertion and the
                                      time that  the  image  appears  at  full
                                      opacity.  Full opacity is the level that
                                      you specify for the opacity setting.  If
                                      you  don't  specify a value for Fade-in,
                                      the image will appear  abruptly  at  the
                                      overlay start time.

                                   FadeOut -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds, between the end of the  time  that
                                      you have specified for the image overlay
                                      Duration and when the overlaid image has
                                      faded  to  total  transparency.  If  you
                                      don't specify a value for Fade-out,  the
                                      image will disappear abruptly at the end
                                      of the inserted image duration.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Specify the height of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger than the video resolution height,
                                      the  service will crop your overlaid im-
                                      age to fit. To use the native height  of
                                      the image, keep this setting blank.

                                   ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  HTTP,  HTTPS, or Amazon S3
                                      location of the image that you  want  to
                                      overlay  on  the video. Use a PNG or TGA
                                      file.

                                   ImageX -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the  inserted image and the left edge of
                                      the video frame. Required for any  image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   ImageY -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the overlaid image and the top  edge  of
                                      the  video frame. Required for any image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   Layer -> (integer)
                                      Specify how overlapping inserted  images
                                      appear.  Images  with  higher values for
                                      Layer appear on top of images with lower
                                      values for Layer.

                                   Opacity -> (integer)
                                      Use  Opacity  to specify how much of the
                                      underlying video shows through  the  in-
                                      serted  image.  0 is transparent and 100
                                      is fully opaque. Default is 50.

                                   StartTime -> (string)
                                      Specify the timecode of the  frame  that
                                      you want the overlay to first appear on.
                                      This must be in timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF or
                                      HH:MM:SS;FF)  format.  Remember  to take
                                      into account your timecode  source  set-
                                      tings.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the width of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger  than the video resolution width,
                                      the service will crop your overlaid  im-
                                      age  to  fit. To use the native width of
                                      the image, keep this setting blank.

                            SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                               Specify the reference white level, in nits, for
                               all  of your image inserter images. Use to cor-
                               rect brightness levels  within  HDR10  outputs.
                               For 1,000 nit peak brightness displays, we rec-
                               ommend that you set SDR reference  white  level
                               to  203  (according  to  ITU-R  BT.2408). Leave
                               blank to use the default value of 100, or spec-
                               ify an integer from 100 to 1000.

                        NoiseReducer -> (structure)
                            Enable  the  Noise reducer feature to remove noise
                            from your video output  if  necessary.  Enable  or
                            disable this feature for each output individually.
                            This setting is disabled by default. When you  en-
                            able  Noise  reducer, you must also select a value
                            for Noise reducer filter. For  AVC  outputs,  when
                            you  include Noise reducer, you cannot include the
                            Bandwidth reduction filter.

                            Filter -> (string)
                               Use Noise reducer filter to select one  of  the
                               following spatial image filtering functions. To
                               use this setting, you must  also  enable  Noise
                               reducer.  * Bilateral preserves edges while re-
                               ducing noise. * Mean (softest), Gaussian, Lanc-

                               tion. * Spatial does frequency-domain filtering
                               based on JND principles. *  Temporal  optimizes
                               video quality for complex motion.

                            FilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings for a noise reducer filter

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Relative strength of noise reducing filter.
                                   Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                            SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Noise reducer filter settings for spatial  fil-
                               ter.

                               PostFilterSharpenStrength -> (integer)
                                   Specify  strength  of  post noise reduction
                                   sharpening filter,  with  0  disabling  the
                                   filter   and   3  enabling  it  at  maximum
                                   strength.

                               Speed -> (integer)
                                   The speed of the  filter,  from  -2  (lower
                                   speed)  to  3  (higher speed), with 0 being
                                   the nominal value.

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Relative strength of noise reducing filter.
                                   Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                            TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Noise reducer filter settings for temporal fil-
                               ter.

                               AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                                   Use Aggressive mode for  content  that  has
                                   complex   motion.   Higher  values  produce
                                   stronger temporal filtering.  This  filters
                                   highly complex scenes more aggressively and
                                   creates better VQ for low bitrate outputs.

                               PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                                   When you set Noise reducer to Temporal, the
                                   bandwidth  and  sharpness of your output is
                                   reduced. You can optionally use Post tempo-
                                   ral  sharpening  to apply sharpening to the
                                   edges of your output. Note that Post tempo-
                                   ral sharpening will also make the bandwidth
                                   reduction from the Noise  reducer  smaller.
                                   The  default  behavior,  Auto,  allows  the
                                   transcoder to determine  whether  to  apply
                                   sharpening,  depending  on  your input type
                                   and quality. When  you  set  Post  temporal
                                   sharpening  to  Enabled,  specify  how much
                                   sharpening is applied using  Post  temporal
                                   sharpening   strength.  Set  Post  temporal
                                   sharpening to Disabled to not apply  sharp-
                                   ening.

                               PostTemporalSharpeningStrength -> (string)
                                   Use  Post  temporal  sharpening strength to
                                   define  the  amount   of   sharpening   the
                                   transcoder applies to your output. Set Post
                                   temporal  sharpening   strength   to   Low,
                                   Medium,  or  High to indicate the amount of
                                   sharpening.

                               Speed -> (integer)
                                   The speed of the filter (higher  number  is
                                   faster).  Low  setting  reduces bit rate at
                                   the cost of transcode  time,  high  setting
                                   improves  transcode time at the cost of bit
                                   rate.

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Specify the strength of the noise  reducing
                                   filter  on  this output. Higher values pro-
                                   duce stronger filtering. We  recommend  the
                                   following  value  ranges,  depending on the
                                   result that you want: * 0-2 for  complexity
                                   reduction with minimal sharpness loss * 2-8
                                   for complexity reduction with image preser-
                                   vation  * 8-16 for a high level of complex-
                                   ity reduction

                                   (NGPR/G2),  specify  an  integer   from   1
                                   through  4,194,303.  You  must  generate  a
                                   unique ID for each asset you watermark, and
                                   keep a record of which ID you have assigned
                                   to each asset. Neither Nagra nor  MediaCon-

                                   watermarking in your job.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Ignore this setting unless Nagra
                                   support directs you  to  specify  a  value.
                                   When  you  don't  specify a value here, the
                                   Nagra NexGuard  library  uses  its  default
                                   value.

                        TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                            Settings for burning the output timecode and spec-
                            ified prefix into the output.

                            FontSize -> (integer)
                               Use Font size to  set  the  font  size  of  any
                               burned-in  timecode.  Valid  values are 10, 16,
                               32, 48.

                            Position -> (string)
                               Use Position under Timecode burn-in to  specify
                               the  location  the burned-in timecode on output
                               video.

                            Prefix -> (string)
                               Use Prefix to place ASCII characters before any
                               burned-in  timecode.  For  example, a prefix of
                               "EZ-"   will    result    in    the    timecode
                               "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the characters
                               themselves or the ASCII code  equivalents.  The
                               supported  range  of characters is 0x20 through
                               0x7e. This includes letters, numbers,  and  all
                               special  characters  represented  on a standard
                               English keyboard.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Use Width to define the  video  resolution  width,  in
                        pixels, for this output. To use the same resolution as
                        your input: Leave both  Width  and  Height  blank.  To
                        evenly  scale  from your input resolution: Leave Width
                        blank and enter a value for Height.  For  example,  if
                        your  input  is  1920x1080  and you set Height to 720,
                        your output will be 1280x720.
