OPTIONS
       --id (string) the job ID of the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details for a particular job

       The  following  example  requests  the  information for the job with ID
       1234567890987-1ab2c3, which in this example ended in an error.

          aws mediaconvert get-job \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --id 1234567890987-1ab2c3

       To get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or  send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       If your request is successful, the service returns a JSON file with job
       information, including job settings, any returned errors, and other job
       data, as follows:

          {
              "Job": {
                  "Status": "ERROR",
                  "Queue": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:region-name-1:012345678998:queues/Queue1",
                  "Settings": {
                      ...<truncated for brevity>...
                  },
                  "ErrorMessage": "Unable to open input file [s3://my-input-bucket/file-name.mp4]: [Failed probe/open: [Failed to read data: AssumeRole failed]]",
                  "ErrorCode": 1434,
                  "Role": "arn:aws:iam::012345678998:role/MediaConvertServiceRole",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:us-west-1:012345678998:jobs/1234567890987-1ab2c3",
                  "UserMetadata": {},
                  "Timing": {

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Each  job  converts  an input file into an output file or files. For
          more     information,      see      the      User      Guide      at
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

          AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
              Accelerated  transcoding  can  significantly  speed up jobs with
              long, visually complex content.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specify the conditions when the service  will  run  your  job
                 with accelerated transcoding.

          AccelerationStatus -> (string)
              Describes  whether  the  current job is running with accelerated
              transcoding. For jobs that have Acceleration  (AccelerationMode)
              set  to  DISABLED,  AccelerationStatus is always NOT_APPLICABLE.
              For jobs that have Acceleration (AccelerationMode)  set  to  EN-
              ABLED  or  PREFERRED,  AccelerationStatus  is  one  of the other
              states. AccelerationStatus is IN_PROGRESS initially,  while  the
              service  determines whether the input files and job settings are
              compatible with accelerated transcoding. If they  are,  Acclera-
              tionStatus  is ACCELERATED. If your input files and job settings
              aren't compatible with accelerated transcoding, the service  ei-
              ther  fails your job or runs it without accelerated transcoding,
              depending on how you set Acceleration  (AccelerationMode).  When
              the  service  runs your job without accelerated transcoding, Ac-
              celerationStatus is NOT_ACCELERATED.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          BillingTagsSource -> (string)
              The  tag  type  that AWS Billing and Cost Management will use to
              sort your AWS Elemental MediaConvert costs on any billing report
              that you set up.

          ClientRequestToken -> (string)
              Prevent duplicate jobs from being created and ensure idempotency
              for your requests. A client request token can be any string that
              includes  up  to  64 ASCII characters. If you reuse a client re-
              quest token within one minute of a successful request,  the  API
              returns  the  job  details  of the original request instead. For
              more                       information                       see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/apireference/idempotency.html.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in Unix epoch format in seconds, when the job got cre-
              ated.

          CurrentPhase -> (string)
              A job's phase can be PROBING, TRANSCODING OR UPLOADING

          ErrorCode -> (integer)
              Error code for the job

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Error message of Job

          HopDestinations -> (list)
              Optional list of hop destinations.

              (structure)
                 Optional.  Configuration for a destination queue to which the
                 job can hop once a customer-defined  minimum  wait  time  has
                 passed.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Optional. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can specify a different relative priority for the job  in
                     the destination queue. If you don't specify, the relative
                     priority will remain the same as in the previous queue.

                 Queue -> (string)
                     Optional unless the  job  is  submitted  on  the  default
                     queue.  When  you  set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be the
                     original  queue  to  which  the  job is submitted. If the
                     original queue isn't the  default  queue  and  you  don't
                     specify  the  destination queue, the job will move to the
                     default queue.

                 WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                     Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Mini-
                     mum  wait  time  in  minutes until the job can hop to the
                     destination queue. Valid range is 1 to 4320 minutes,  in-
                     clusive.

          Id -> (string)
              A portion of the job's ARN, unique within your AWS Elemental Me-
              diaConvert resources

          JobPercentComplete -> (integer)
              An estimate of how far your job has progressed. This estimate is
              shown  as  a  percentage  of  the  total time from when your job
              leaves its queue to when your output files appear in your output
              Amazon  S3  bucket.  AWS Elemental MediaConvert provides jobPer-
              centComplete in CloudWatch STATUS_UPDATE events and in  the  re-
              sponse  to  GetJob and ListJobs requests. The jobPercentComplete
              estimate is reliable for the following input containers:  Quick-
              time, Transport Stream, MP4, and MXF. For some jobs, the service
              can't provide information about job progress.  In  those  cases,
              jobPercentComplete returns a null value.

          JobTemplate -> (string)
              The  job template that the job is created from, if it is created
              from a job template.

          Messages -> (structure)
              Provides messages from the service about jobs that you have  al-
              ready successfully submitted.

              Info -> (list)
                 List  of messages that are informational only and don't indi-
                 cate a problem with your job.

              Warning -> (list)
                 List of messages that warn about conditions that might  cause
                 your job not to run or to fail.

                 (string)

          OutputGroupDetails -> (list)
              List of output group details

              (structure)
                 Contains details about the output groups specified in the job
                 settings.

                               Width in pixels for the output

          Priority -> (integer)
              Relative priority on the job.

          Queue -> (string)
              When you create a job, you can specify a queue to send it to. If
              you  don't  specify,  the  job will go to the default queue. For
              more   about   queues,   see   the   User   Guide    topic    at
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

                 input Ad Avail PTS time.

              AvailBlanking -> (structure)
                 Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or over-
                 laid with an image, and audio muted during SCTE-35  triggered
                 ad avails.

                 AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                     Blanking  image  to be used. Leave empty for solid black.
                     Only bmp and png images are supported.

              Esam -> (structure)
                 Settings for Event Signaling And  Messaging  (ESAM).  If  you
                 don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                 ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses
                     the  manifest  conditioning instructions that you provide
                     in the setting MCC XML.

                     MccXml -> (string)
                        Provide your ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML  document  inside your JSON job settings. Form the
                        XML document  as  per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.  The
                        transcoder will use the Manifest Conditioning instruc-
                        tions in the message that you supply.

                 ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                     Specifies the stream distance, in  milliseconds,  between
                     the  SCTE  35 messages that the transcoder places and the
                     splice points that they refer to. If the time between the
                     start  of  the asset and the SCTE-35 message is less than
                     this value, then the transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker
                     at the beginning of the stream.

                 SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as per
                     OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the signal
                     processing  instructions  that you provide in the setting
                     SCC XML.

                     SccXml -> (string)
                        Provide  your  ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML
                        document  inside  your JSON job settings. Form the XML
                        document   as   per   OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.   The
                        transcoder will use the signal processing instructions
                        in the message that you supply. For your MPEG2-TS file
                        outputs,  if  you  want  the  service to place SCTE-35
                        markers at the insertion points you specify in the XML
                        document, you must also enable SCTE-35 ESAM. Note that
                        you can either specify an ESAM XML document or  enable
                        SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

              ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                 If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services, en-
                 able this feature to specify what MediaConvert does with  the
                 Extended  Data Services (XDS) packets. You can choose to pass
                 through XDS packets, or remove them from the output. For more
                 information  about  XDS, see EIA-608 Line Data Services, sec-
                 tion 9.5.1.5 05h Content Advisory.

                 CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on copy and redistribution control XDS
                     packets.  If  you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be
                     changed. If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed
                     in output captions.

                 VchipAction -> (string)
                     The  action  to  take on content advisory XDS packets. If
                     you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be  changed.  If
                     you  select  STRIP, any packets will be removed in output
                     captions.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Use Inputs to define source file used in the  transcode  job.
                 There  can be multiple inputs add in a job. These inputs will
                 be concantenated together to create the output.

                 (structure)
                     Use inputs to  define  the  source  files  used  in  your
                     transcoding    job.    For    more    information,    see

                     AdvancedInputFilter -> (string)
                        Use to remove noise, blocking, blurriness, or  ringing
                        from  your input as a pre-filter step before encoding.
                        The Advanced input filter removes more types  of  com-
                        pression artifacts and is an improvement when compared
                        to basic Deblock and Denoise filters. To remove  video
                        compression  artifacts from your input and improve the
                        video quality: Choose Enabled. Additionally, this fil-
                        ter can help increase the video quality of your output
                        relative to its bitrate, since noisy inputs  are  more
                        complex  and  require more bits to encode. To help re-
                        store loss of detail after applying  the  filter,  you
                        can  optionally  add texture or sharpening as an addi-
                        tional step. Jobs that use this feature incur pro-tier
                        pricing. To not apply advanced input filtering: Choose
                        Disabled. Note that you can still apply basic  filter-
                        ing with Deblock and Denoise.

                     AdvancedInputFilterSettings -> (structure)
                        Optional  settings  for Advanced input filter when you
                        set Advanced input filter to Enabled.

                        AddTexture -> (string)
                            Add texture and detail  to  areas  of  your  input
                            video  content  that  were lost after applying the
                            Advanced input filter. To adaptively  add  texture
                            and  reduce  softness:  Choose Enabled. To not add
                            any texture: Keep the default value, Disabled.  We
                            recommend that you choose Disabled for input video
                            content  that  doesn't  have  texture,   including
                            screen recordings, computer graphics, or cartoons.

                        Sharpening -> (string)
                            Optionally specify the amount of sharpening to ap-
                            ply when you use the Advanced input filter. Sharp-
                            ening  adds  contrast  to  the edges of your video
                            content and  can  reduce  softness.  To  apply  no
                            sharpening:  Keep the default value, Off. To apply
                            a minimal amount of sharpening choose Low, or  for
                            the maximum choose High.

                     AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                        Use  audio selector groups to combine multiple sidecar
                        audio inputs so that you can assign them to  a  single
                        output  audio  tab.  Note that, if you're working with
                        embedded audio, it's simpler to assign multiple  input
                        tracks into a single audio selector rather than use an
                        audio selector group.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use audio  selector  groups  to  combine  multiple
                            sidecar  audio  inputs so that you can assign them
                            to a single output audio tab. Note that, if you're
                            working  with  embedded audio, it's simpler to as-
                            sign multiple input tracks into a single audio se-
                            lector rather than use an audio selector group.

                            AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                               Name of an Audio Selector within the same input
                               to include in the group. Audio  selector  names
                               are  standardized,  based on their order within
                               the input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio
                               selector  name parameter can be repeated to add
                               any number of audio selectors to the group.

                               (string)

                     AudioSelectors -> (map)
                        Use Audio selectors to  specify  a  track  or  set  of
                        tracks  from  the input that you will use in your out-
                        puts. You can use multiple Audio selectors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use Audio selectors to specify a track or  set  of
                            tracks  from  the  input that you will use in your
                            outputs. You can use multiple Audio selectors  per
                            input.

                            AudioDurationCorrection -> (string)
                               Apply audio timing corrections to help synchro-
                               nize audio and video in your output.  To  apply
                               timing  corrections,  your  input must meet the
                               following requirements: *  Container:  MP4,  or
                               MOV, with an accurate time-to-sample (STTS) ta-
                               ble. * Audio track: AAC. Choose from  the  fol-
                               lowing audio timing correction settings: * Dis-
                               abled (Default): Apply no correction.  *  Auto:
                               Recommended  for most inputs. MediaConvert ana-
                               lyzes the audio timing in your input and deter-
                               mines  which  correction  setting  to  use,  if
                               needed. * Track: Adjust the  duration  of  each
                               audio  frame  by a constant amount to align the
                               audio  track   length   with   STTS   duration.
                               Track-level  correction  does not affect pitch,
                               and is recommended for tonal audio content such
                               as  music. * Frame: Adjust the duration of each
                               audio frame by a variable amount to align audio
                               frames with STTS timestamps. No corrections are
                               made  to  already-aligned  frames.  Frame-level
                               correction  may  affect  the pitch of corrected
                               frames, and is  recommended  for  atonal  audio
                               content such as speech or percussion.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source, using the ISO 639-2 or ISO  639-3
                               three-letter language code

                            DefaultSelection -> (string)
                               Enable  this  setting  on one audio selector to
                               set it as the default for the job. The  service
                               uses  this  default  for outputs where it can't
                               find the specified input audio.  If  you  don't
                               set a default, those outputs have no audio.

                            ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                               Specifies  audio  data  from  an  external file
                               source.

                            HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings specific to audio sources  in  an  HLS
                               alternate  rendition group. Specify the proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode)  to identify the unique audio
                               track among the  alternative  rendition  groups
                               present in the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                               is found, or multiple tracks match the  proper-
                               ties  provided, the job fails. If no properties
                               in hlsRenditionGroupSettings are specified, the
                               default audio track within the video segment is
                               chosen. If there is no audio within video  seg-
                               ment, the alternative audio with DEFAULT=YES is
                               chosen instead.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify ISO 639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                            LanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source.

                            Offset -> (integer)
                               Specifies a time delta in milliseconds to  off-
                               set the audio from the input video.

                            Pids -> (list)
                               Selects  a  specific  PID  from within an audio
                               source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                               (integer)

                            ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                               Use this setting for input streams that contain
                               Dolby  E,  to have the service extract specific
                               program data from the track. To select multiple
                               programs,  create  multiple  selectors with the
                               same Track and different  Program  numbers.  In
                               the  console,  this setting is visible when you
                               set Selector type to Track. Choose the  program
                               number  from  the  dropdown list. If your input
                               file has incorrect metadata, you can choose All
                               channels  instead  of  a program number to have
                               the service ignore the program IDs and  include
                               all the programs in the track.

                            RemixSettings -> (structure)
                               Use  these  settings to reorder the audio chan-
                               nels of one input to match those of another in-
                               put.  This  allows you to combine the two files
                               into a single output, one after the other.

                               ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                   Channel  mapping  contains  the  group   of
                                   fields  that  hold  the  remixing value for
                                   each channel, in dB. Specify  remix  values
                                   to  indicate  how  much of the content from
                                   your input audio channel you want  in  your
                                   output audio channels. Each instance of the
                                   InputChannels or InputChannelsFineTune  ar-
                                   ray  specifies  these values for one output
                                   channel. Use one instance of this array for
                                   each  output  channel. In the console, each
                                   array corresponds to a column in the graph-
                                   ical  depiction  of the mapping matrix. The
                                   rows of the graphical matrix correspond  to
                                   input channels. Valid values are within the
                                   range from -60 (mute) through 6. A  setting
                                   of  0 passes the input channel unchanged to
                                   the output channel (no attenuation  or  am-

                                   Specify  the  number of audio channels from
                                   your input that you want  to  use  in  your
                                   output. With remixing, you might combine or
                                   split the data in these  channels,  so  the
                                   number  of  channels  in  your final output
                                   might be different. If you are  doing  both
                                   input  channel  mapping  and output channel
                                   mapping, the number of output  channels  in
                                   your  input mapping must be the same as the
                                   number of input  channels  in  your  output
                                   mapping.

                               ChannelsOut -> (integer)

                                   6,  8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If
                                   you are doing both  input  channel  mapping
                                   and  output  channel mapping, the number of
                                   output channels in your input mapping  must
                                   be the same as the number of input channels
                                   in your output mapping.

                            SelectorType -> (string)

                               Identify a track from the input  audio  to  in-
                               clude  in  this  selector by entering the track
                               index number. To include several  tracks  in  a
                               single  audio selector, specify multiple tracks
                               as  follows.  Using  the   console,   enter   a
                               comma-separated list. For example, type "1,2,3"
                               to include tracks 1 through 3.

                               (integer)

                     CaptionSelectors -> (map)
                        Use captions selectors to specify  the  captions  data
                        from  your input that you use in your outputs. You can
                        use up to 100 captions selectors per input.

                               language  to  extract.  If input is DVB-Sub and
                               output is Burn-in, complete this  field  and/or
                               PID  to select the caption language to extract.
                               If  input  is  DVB-Sub  that  is  being  passed
                               through, omit this field (and PID field); there
                               is no way to extract a specific  language  with
                               pass-through captions.

                            LanguageCode -> (string)

                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless your input
                                      captions format is SCC. To have the ser-
                                      vice   compensate  for  differing  frame
                                      rates between your  input  captions  and
                                      input  video,  specify the frame rate of
                                      the captions file. Specify this value as
                                      a fraction. For example, you might spec-
                                      ify 24 / 1 for 24 fps, 25  /  1  for  25
                                      fps,  24000  /  1001  for 23.976 fps, or
                                      30000 / 1001 for 29.97 fps.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Specify the denominator of the frac-
                                          tion  that represents the frame rate
                                          for the setting Caption source frame
                                          rate.  Use  this  setting along with
                                          the setting Framerate numerator.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Specify the numerator of  the  frac-
                                          tion  that represents the frame rate
                                          for the setting Caption source frame
                                          rate.  Use  this  setting along with
                                          the setting Framerate denominator.

                                   SourceFile -> (string)
                                      External caption file used  for  loading
                                      captions.  Accepted  file extensions are
                                      'scc',  'ttml',  'dfxp',  'stl',  'srt',

                                   TimeDelta -> (integer)
                                      Optional. Use this setting when you need
                                      to adjust the sync between your  sidecar

                                      Enter a positive or negative  number  to
                                      modify  the  times in the captions file.
                                      For example, type 15 to add  15  seconds
                                      to  all  the times in the captions file.
                                      Type -5 to subtract 5 seconds  from  the
                                      times  in the captions file. You can op-
                                      tionally specify your time delta in mil-
                                      liseconds  instead  of seconds. When you
                                      do so, set  the  related  setting,  Time
                                      delta  units to Milliseconds. Note that,
                                      when you specify a time delta for  time-
                                      code-based  caption sources, such as SCC
                                      and STL, and your  time  delta  isn't  a

                                      Convert snaps the captions to the  near-
                                      est  frame. For example, when your input
                                      video frame rate is 25 fps and you spec-
                                      ify  1010ms for time delta, MediaConvert
                                      delays your captions by 1000 ms.

                                   TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                      When you use the setting Time  delta  to
                                      adjust  the  sync  between  your sidecar
                                      captions and your video, use  this  set-
                                      ting  to specify the units for the delta
                                      that you specify. When you don't specify
                                      a  value for Time delta units, MediaCon-
                                      vert uses seconds by default.

                               SourceType -> (string)
                                   Use Source to identify the format  of  your
                                   input captions. The service cannot auto-de-
                                   tect caption format.

                               TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to   Teletext   caption
                                   sources, including Page number.

                                   PageNumber -> (string)
                                      Use   Page   Number   to   specify   the
                                      three-digit hexadecimal page number that
                                      will  be  used for Teletext captions. Do
                                      not use this setting if you are  passing
                                      through  teletext  from the input source
                                      to output.

                               TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings specific to caption  sources  that
                                   are  specified  by track number. Currently,
                                   this is only IMSC captions in an IMF  pack-
                                   age.  If your caption source is IMSC 1.1 in
                                   a separate xml file, use FileSourceSettings
                                   instead of TrackSourceSettings.

                                   TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting to select a single cap-
                                      tions track from a source. Track numbers
                                      correspond  to the order in the captions
                                      source file. For IMF sources, track num-
                                      bering  is  based  on the order that the
                                      captions appear in the CPL. For example,
                                      use  1 to select the captions asset that
                                      is listed first in the CPL.  To  include
                                      more than one captions track in your job
                                      outputs, create multiple input  captions
                                      selectors.  Specify one track per selec-
                                      tor.

                               WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings specific to WebVTT sources in  HLS
                                   alternative  rendition  group.  Specify the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or  renditionLanguageCode)  to identify the
                                   unique subtitle track among the alternative
                                   rendition  groups  present in the HLS mani-
                                   fest. If no unique track is found, or  mul-
                                   tiple  tracks  match  the specified proper-
                                   ties, the job fails. If there is  only  one
                                   subtitle  track in the rendition group, the
                                   settings can be left empty and the  default
                                   subtitle track will be chosen. If your cap-
                                   tion source is a sidecar  file,  use  File-
                                   SourceSettings  instead of WebvttHlsSource-
                                   Settings.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                                   RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                      code in the language property

                                   RenditionName -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify media name

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use  Cropping selection to specify the video area that
                        the service will include in the output video frame. If
                        you  specify  a value here, it will override any value
                        that you specify in the output setting Cropping selec-
                        tion.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DeblockFilter -> (string)
                        Enable  Deblock to produce smoother motion in the out-
                        put. Default is disabled. Only  manually  controllable
                        for MPEG2 and uncompressed video inputs.

                     DecryptionSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  for  decrypting any input files that you en-
                        crypt before you upload them to Amazon  S3.  MediaCon-
                        vert  can decrypt files only when you use AWS Key Man-
                        agement Service (KMS) to encrypt the data key that you
                        use to encrypt your content.

                        DecryptionMode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  encryption mode that you used to en-
                            crypt your input files.

                        EncryptedDecryptionKey -> (string)
                            Warning! Don't  provide  your  encryption  key  in
                            plaintext. Your job settings could be intercepted,
                            making your encrypted content vulnerable.  Specify
                            the  encrypted  version  of  the data key that you
                            used to encrypt your content. The data key must be
                            encrypted by AWS Key Management Service (KMS). The
                            key can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            Specify the initialization vector  that  you  used
                            when  you  encrypted your content before uploading
                            it to Amazon S3. You can use a 16-byte initializa-
                            tion  vector with any encryption mode. Or, you can
                            use a 12-byte initialization vector  with  GCM  or
                            CTR. MediaConvert accepts only initialization vec-
                            tors that are base64-encoded.

                        KmsKeyRegion -> (string)
                            Specify the AWS Region for AWS Key Management Ser-
                            vice (KMS) that you used to encrypt your data key,
                            if that Region is different from the one  you  are
                            using for AWS Elemental MediaConvert.

                     DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                        Enable Denoise to filter noise from the input. Default
                        is disabled. Only applicable to MPEG2,  H.264,  H.265,
                        and uncompressed video inputs.

                     DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when your video source has Dolby
                        Vision studio mastering metadata that is carried in  a
                        separate  XML file. Specify the Amazon S3 location for
                        the metadata XML file. MediaConvert uses this file  to
                        provide  global and frame-level metadata for Dolby Vi-
                        sion preprocessing. When you specify a file  here  and
                        your input also has interleaved global and frame level
                        metadata, MediaConvert ignores the  interleaved  meta-
                        data and uses only the the metadata from this external
                        XML file. Note that your IAM service role  must  grant
                        MediaConvert  read  permissions to this file. For more
                        information,                                       see

                     FileInput -> (string)
                        Specify the source file for your transcoding job.  You
                        can  use  multiple inputs in a single job. The service
                        concatenates these inputs, in the order that you spec-
                        ify  them  in  the job, to create the outputs. If your
                        input format is IMF, specify your input  by  providing
                        the     path     to    your    CPL.    For    example,
                        "s3://bucket/vf/cpl.xml". If the CPL is in  an  incom-
                        plete IMP, make sure to use Supplemental IMPs to spec-
                        ify any supplemental IMPs that contain  assets  refer-
                        enced by the CPL.

                     FilterEnable -> (string)
                        Specify  whether  to  apply input filtering to improve
                        the video quality of your input.  To  apply  filtering
                        depending on your input type and quality: Choose Auto.
                        To apply no filtering: Choose Disable. To  apply  fil-
                        tering  regardless  of  your  input  type and quality:
                        Choose Force. When you do, you  must  also  specify  a
                        value for Filter strength.

                     FilterStrength -> (integer)
                        Specify  the strength of the input filter. To apply an
                        automatic amount of filtering  based  the  compression
                        artifacts  measured  in  your input: We recommend that
                        you leave Filter strength blank and set Filter  enable
                        to  Auto.  To  manually apply filtering: Enter a value
                        from 1 to 5, where 1 is the least amount of  filtering
                        and 5 is the most. The value that you enter applies to
                        the strength of the Deblock or Denoise filters, or  to
                        the strength of the Advanced input filter.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay on your video. Enable or disable this  feature
                        for  each input individually. This setting is disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify the images that you  want  to  overlay  on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These  settings  apply  to  a  specific graphic
                               overlay. You can include multiple  overlays  in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the time, in milliseconds, for the
                                   image to remain on the output  video.  This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify for the image insertion  and  the  time
                                   that  the  image  appears  at full opacity.
                                   Full opacity is the level that you  specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for Fade-in, the image will ap-
                                   pear abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the end of the time that  you
                                   have  specified for the image overlay Dura-
                                   tion and when the overlaid image has  faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear  abruptly  at  the end of the inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the  video  resolution  height,
                                   the  service  will crop your overlaid image
                                   to fit. To use the native height of the im-
                                   age, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion of the image that you want to  overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the  overlaid image and the top edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify how overlapping inserted images ap-
                                   pear. Images with higher values  for  Layer
                                   appear  on  top of images with lower values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use Opacity to specify how much of the  un-
                                   derlying  video  shows through the inserted
                                   image. 0 is transparent and  100  is  fully
                                   opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify  the timecode of the frame that you
                                   want the overlay to first appear  on.  This
                                   must   be   in   timecode  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF) format. Remember to take  into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the width of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service will crop your  overlaid  image  to
                                   fit.  To use the native width of the image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify the reference white level,  in  nits,  for
                            all  of your image inserter images. Use to correct
                            brightness levels within HDR10 outputs. For  1,000
                            nit  peak  brightness  displays, we recommend that
                            you set SDR reference white level to 203  (accord-
                            ing  to ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank to use the de-
                            fault value of 100, or specify an integer from 100
                            to 1000.

                     InputClippings -> (list)
                        Contains  sets  of  start  and end times that together
                        specify a portion of the input to be used in the  out-
                        puts.  If you provide only a start time, the clip will
                        be the entire input from that point to the end. If you
                        provide  only an end time, it will be the entire input
                        up to that point. When you specify more than one input
                        clip,  the transcoding service creates the job outputs
                        by stringing the clips together in the order you spec-
                        ify them.

                        (structure)
                            To  transcode only portions of your input, include
                            one input clip for each part of  your  input  that
                            you  want in your output. All input clips that you
                            specify will be included in every  output  of  the
                            job.      For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                            EndTimecode -> (string)
                               Set  End  timecode to the end of the portion of
                               the input you are clipping.  The  frame  corre-
                               sponding  to the End timecode value is included
                               in the clip. Start timecode or End timecode may
                               be  left  blank,  but  not both. Use the format
                               HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF,  where  HH  is  the
                               hour,  MM  is the minute, SS is the second, and
                               FF is the  frame  number.  When  choosing  this
                               value, take into account your setting for time-
                               code source under input settings. For  example,
                               if  you  have  embedded timecodes that start at
                               01:00:00:00 and you want your clip to  end  six
                               minutes into the video, use 01:06:00:00.

                            StartTimecode -> (string)
                               Set Start timecode to the beginning of the por-
                               tion of the input you are clipping.  The  frame
                               corresponding  to  the  Start timecode value is
                               included in the clip.  Start  timecode  or  End
                               timecode  may  be left blank, but not both. Use
                               the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH
                               is  the  hour, MM is the minute, SS is the sec-
                               ond, and FF is the frame number. When  choosing
                               this  value, take into account your setting for
                               Input timecode source. For example, if you have
                               embedded  timecodes  that  start at 01:00:00:00
                               and you want your clip to  begin  five  minutes
                               into the video, use 01:05:00:00.

                     InputScanType -> (string)
                        When  you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF) in-
                        put, use this setting to flag the input as PsF. Media-
                        Convert  doesn't  automatically detect PsF. Therefore,
                        flagging your input as PsF results in better preserva-
                        tion  of  video  quality when you do deinterlacing and
                        frame rate conversion. If you don't specify,  the  de-
                        fault  value  is Auto. Auto is the correct setting for
                        all inputs that are not PsF. Don't set this  value  to
                        PsF  when  your  input is interlaced. Doing so creates
                        horizontal interlacing artifacts.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement to define the  video  area  in
                        your  output  frame. The area outside of the rectangle
                        that you specify here is black. If you specify a value
                        here,  it  will override any value that you specify in
                        the output setting Selection placement. If you specify
                        a  value  here,  this  will override any AFD values in
                        your input, even if you set Respond to AFD to Respond.
                        If you specify a value here, this will ignore anything
                        that you specify for the setting Scaling Behavior.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use Program to select a specific program from within a
                        multi-program  transport  stream. Note that Quad 4K is
                        not currently supported. Default is the first  program
                        within  the transport stream. If the program you spec-
                        ify doesn't exist, the transcoding  service  will  use
                        this default.

                     PsiControl -> (string)
                        Set PSI control for transport stream inputs to specify
                        which data the demux process to scans. * Ignore PSI  -
                        Scan  all  PIDs  for audio and video. * Use PSI - Scan
                        only PSI data.

                     SupplementalImps -> (list)
                        Provide a list of any necessary supplemental IMPs. You
                        need  supplemental  IMPs  if the CPL that you're using
                        for your input is in an incomplete IMP. Specify either
                        the supplemental IMP directories with a trailing slash
                        or    the    ASSETMAP.xml    files.    For     example
                        ["s3://bucket/ov/",   "s3://bucket/vf2/ASSETMAP.xml"].
                        You don't need to specify the IMP that  contains  your
                        input  CPL,  because the service automatically detects
                        it.

                        (string)

                     TimecodeSource -> (string)
                        Use this Timecode source setting,  located  under  the
                        input  settings, to specify how the service counts in-
                        put video frames. This input frame count affects  only
                        the  behavior of features that apply to a single input
                        at a time, such as input  clipping  and  synchronizing
                        some  captions  formats.  Choose  Embedded  to use the
                        timecodes in your input video. Choose Start at zero to
                        start  the first frame at zero. Choose Specified start
                        to start the first frame  at  the  timecode  that  you
                        specify  in  the  setting Start timecode. If you don't
                        specify a value for Timecode source, the service  will
                        use  Embedded  by  default. For more information about
                        timecodes,                                         see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     TimecodeStart -> (string)
                        Specify the timecode that you want the service to  use
                        for  this  input's initial frame. To use this setting,
                        you must set the Timecode source setting, located  un-
                        der  the  input settings, to Specified start. For more
                        information        about        timecodes,         see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     VideoGenerator -> (structure)
                        When you include Video generator, MediaConvert creates
                        a  video  input with black frames. Use this setting if
                        you do not have a video input or if you  want  to  add
                        black video frames before, or after, other inputs. You
                        can specify Video generator, or you can specify an In-
                        put file, but you cannot specify both. For more infor-
                        mation,                                            see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-generator.html

                        Duration -> (integer)
                            Specify an integer value for Black video  duration
                            from  50 to 86400000 to generate a black video in-
                            put for that many milliseconds. Required when  you
                            include Video generator.

                     VideoSelector -> (structure)
                        Input  video  selectors contain the video settings for
                        the input. Each of your inputs  can  have  up  to  one
                        video selector.

                        AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                            Ignore  this setting unless this input is a Quick-
                            Time animation with an  alpha  channel.  Use  this
                            setting  to  create separate Key and Fill outputs.
                            In each output, specify which part  of  the  input
                            MediaConvert  uses.  Leave this setting at the de-
                            fault value DISCARD to delete  the  alpha  channel
                            and preserve the video. Set it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to
                            delete the video and map the alpha channel to  the
                            luma channel of your outputs.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            If your input video has accurate color space meta-
                            data, or if you don't know about color space: Keep
                            the default value, Follow. MediaConvert will auto-
                            matically detect your input color space.  If  your
                            input  video  has  metadata  indicating  the wrong
                            color space, or has missing metadata: Specify  the
                            accurate  color space here. If your input video is
                            HDR 10 and the SMPTE  ST  2086  Mastering  Display
                            Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your

                            not accurate: Choose Force HDR 10. Specify correct
                            values in the input HDR 10 metadata settings.  For

                            When  you  specify an input color space, MediaCon-
                            vert uses  the  following  color  space  metadata,
                            which  includes  color primaries, transfer charac-
                            teristics, and  matrix  coefficients:  *  HDR  10:

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            There  are two sources for color metadata, the in-
                            put file and the job input  settings  Color  space
                            and  HDR  master display information settings. The
                            Color space usage setting determines  which  takes
                            precedence.  Choose  Force  to  use color metadata
                            from the input job settings. If you don't  specify
                            values for those settings, the service defaults to
                            using metadata from your input. FALLBACK -  Choose
                            Fallback  to  use  color  metadata from the source
                            when it is present. If there's no  color  metadata
                            in  your input file, the service defaults to using
                            values you specify in the input settings.

                        EmbeddedTimecodeOverride -> (string)
                            Set Embedded timecode override to  Use  MDPM  when
                            your AVCHD input contains timecode tag data in the
                            Modified Digital Video Pack Metadata. When you do,
                            we  recommend  you also set Timecode source to Em-
                            bedded. Leave Embedded timecode override blank, or
                            set to None, when your input does not contain MDPM
                            timecode.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that
                            is  missing or inaccurate in your input video. Ap-
                            propriate values vary depending on the input video
                            and  must be provided by a color grader. The color
                            grader generates these values during  the  HDR  10
                            mastering  process.  The  valid  range for each of
                            these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment rep-
                            resents  0.00002  in CIE1931 color coordinate. Re-
                            lated settings - When you  specify  these  values,
                            you  must also set Color space to HDR 10. To spec-
                            ify whether the the values you specify  here  take
                            precedence over the values in the metadata of your
                            input file, set  Color  space  usage.  To  specify
                            whether  color  metadata is included in an output,
                            set Color metadata. For more information about Me-

                               this setting is not for color correction.

                            WhitePointY -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by a color grader, using color  grading  tools.
                               Range is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents

                        PadVideo -> (string)
                            Use this setting if your input has video and audio
                            durations that don't align,  and  your  output  or
                            player  has  strict  alignment requirements. Exam-
                            ples: Input audio track has a delayed start. Input
                            video  track  ends before audio ends. When you set
                            Pad video to Black, MediaConvert  generates  black
                            video  frames so that output video and audio dura-
                            tions match. Black video frames are added  at  the
                            beginning or end, depending on your input. To keep
                            the default behavior and not generate black video,
                            set Pad video to Disabled or leave blank.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Use  PID to select specific video data from an in-
                            put file. Specify this value as  an  integer;  the
                            system  automatically converts it to the hexideci-
                            mal value. For example, 257 selects PID  0x101.  A
                            PID,  or packet identifier, is an identifier for a
                            set of data in an  MPEG-2  transport  stream  con-
                            tainer.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Selects   a   specific   program   from  within  a
                            multi-program transport stream. Note that Quad  4K
                            is not currently supported.

                        Rotate -> (string)
                            Use Rotate to specify how the service rotates your
                            video. You can choose automatic rotation or  spec-
                            ify  a rotation. You can specify a clockwise rota-
                            tion of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. If your  input
                            video container is .mov or .mp4 and your input has
                            rotation metadata, you  can  choose  Automatic  to
                            have  the  service  rotate your video according to
                            the rotation specified in the metadata. The  rota-
                            tion  must be within one degree of 90, 180, or 270
                            degrees. If the rotation  metadata  specifies  any
                            other rotation, the service will default to no ro-
                            tation. By default, the service does no  rotation,
                            even  if  your  input video has rotation metadata.
                            The service doesn't pass  through  rotation  meta-
                            data.

                        SampleRange -> (string)
                            If  the  sample range metadata in your input video
                            is accurate, or if you  don't  know  about  sample
                            range,  keep  the  default value, Follow, for this
                            setting. When you do,  the  service  automatically
                            detects  your  input  sample  range. If your input
                            video has metadata  indicating  the  wrong  sample
                            range,  specify  the  accurate  sample range here.
                            When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range
                            information  in  the input metadata. Regardless of
                            whether MediaConvert uses the input  sample  range
                            or the sample range that you specify, MediaConvert
                            uses the sample range  for  transcoding  and  also
                            writes it to the output metadata.

              KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                 Use  these  settings  only  when you use Kantar watermarking.
                 Specify the values that MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  and
                 place  Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These settings
                 apply to every output in your job. In addition to  specifying
                 these  values, you also need to store your Kantar credentials
                 in  AWS  Secrets   Manager.   For   more   information,   see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

                 ChannelName -> (string)
                     Provide an audio channel name from your Kantar audio  li-
                     cense.

                 ContentReference -> (string)
                     Specify  a  unique  identifier for Kantar to use for this
                     piece of content.

                 CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                     Provide the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret  where
                     your Kantar credentials are stored. Note that your Media-
                     Convert service role must provide access to this  secret.

                 FileOffset -> (double)
                     Optional.  Specify  an offset, in whole seconds, from the
                     start of your output and the beginning of the  watermark-
                     ing. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to
                     zero.

                 KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                     Provide your Kantar license ID  number.  You  should  get
                     this number from Kantar.

                 KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                     Provide  the  HTTPS  endpoint  to  the Kantar server. You
                     should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     Optional. Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want Me-
                     diaConvert  to store your Kantar watermark XML logs. When
                     you don't specify a  bucket,  MediaConvert  doesn't  save
                     these logs. Note that your MediaConvert service role must
                     provide access to this location.  For  more  information,
                     see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

                 Metadata3 -> (string)
                     You  can  optionally  use this field to specify the first
                     timestamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking.  Kantar
                     suggests that you be very cautious when using this Kantar
                     feature, and that you use it only on  channels  that  are
                     managed  specifically  for  use with this feature by your
                     Audience Measurement Operator. For more information about
                     this feature, contact Kantar technical support.

                 Metadata4 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata5 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata6 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata7 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata8 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

              MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                 Overlay motion graphics on top  of  your  video.  The  motion
                 graphics  that  you specify here appear on all outputs in all
                 output     groups.     For     more     information,      see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                 Framerate -> (structure)
                     If your motion graphic asset is a .mov  file,  keep  this
                     setting  unspecified.  If  your motion graphic asset is a
                     series of .png files, specify the frame rate of the over-
                     lay  in  frames  per  second, as a fraction. For example,
                     specify 24 fps as 24/1. Make sure that the number of  im-
                     ages  in  your series matches the frame rate and your in-
                     tended overlay duration.  For  example,  if  you  want  a
                     30-second overlay at 30 fps, you should have 900 .png im-
                     ages. This overlay frame rate doesn't need to  match  the
                     frame rate of the underlying video.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        The bottom of the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 1.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        The  top  of  the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 24.

                 Input -> (string)
                     Specify  the  .mov  file or series of .png files that you
                     want to overlay on your video. For  .png  files,  provide
                     the  file name of the first file in the series. Make sure
                     that the names of the .png files end with sequential num-
                     bers  that specify the order that they are played in. For
                     example,    overlay_000.png,    overlay_001.png,    over-
                     lay_002.png,  and so on. The sequence must start at zero,
                     and each image file name must have  the  same  number  of
                     digits.  Pad your initial file names with enough zeros to
                     complete the sequence. For example, if the first image is
                     overlay_0.png,  there  can  be  only 10 images in the se-
                     quence, with the last image being overlay_9.png.  But  if
                     the  first  image is overlay_00.png, there can be 100 im-
                     ages in the sequence.

                 InsertionMode -> (string)
                     Choose the type of motion graphic asset that you are pro-
                     viding  for  your  overlay.  You can choose either a .mov
                     file or a series of .png files.

                 Offset -> (structure)
                     Use Offset  to  specify  the  placement  of  your  motion
                     graphic  overlay  on  the video frame. Specify in pixels,
                     from the upper-left corner of the  frame.  If  you  don't
                     specify an offset, the service scales your overlay to the
                     full size of the frame. Otherwise,  the  service  inserts
                     the  overlay at its native resolution and scales the size
                     up or down with any video scaling.

                     ImageX -> (integer)
                        Set the distance, in pixels, between the  overlay  and
                        the left edge of the video frame.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay and
                        the top edge of the video frame.

                 Playback -> (string)
                     Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on  a
                     loop or plays only once.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use timecode for-
                     mat (HH:MM:SS:FF or  HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure  that  the
                     timecode you provide here takes into account how you have
                     set up your timecode configuration under  both  job  set-
                     tings  and input settings. The simplest way to do that is
                     to set both to start at 0. If you need to set up your job
                     to  follow  timecodes  embedded in your source that don't
                     start at zero, make sure that you specify  a  start  time
                     that  is  after the first embedded timecode. For more in-
                     formation,   see    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediacon-
                     vert/latest/ug/setting-up-timecode.html

              NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  your  Nielsen  configuration.  If you don't do
                 Nielsen measurement and  analytics,  ignore  these  settings.
                 When  you  enable Nielsen configuration, MediaConvert enables
                 PCM to ID3 tagging for all outputs in the job.

                 BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                     Nielsen has discontinued the use of breakout  code  func-
                     tionality.  If  you  must  include this property, set the
                     value to zero.

                 DistributorId -> (string)
                     Use Distributor ID to specify the distributor ID that  is
                     assigned to your organization by Nielsen.

              NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                 Ignore these settings unless you are using Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking. Specify the values that  MediaConvert  uses  to
                 generate  and  place Nielsen watermarks in your output audio.
                 In addition to specifying these values, you also need to  set
                 up  your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every out-
                 put in your job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently
                 with  the  following  Nielsen versions: Nielsen Watermark SDK
                 Version 5.2.1 Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine  Version  1.2.7
                 Nielsen Watermark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                 ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                     Choose  the  type  of Nielsen watermarks that you want in
                     your outputs. When you choose NAES 2  and  NW,  you  must
                     provide  a  value  for  the  setting SID. When you choose
                     CBET, you must provide a value for the setting CSID. When
                     you  choose NAES 2, NW, and CBET, you must provide values
                     for both of these settings.

                 AdiFilename -> (string)
                     Optional. Use this setting when you want the  service  to
                     include an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                     provide an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide  a
                     URL  to  it here. The URL should be in the following for-
                     mat:  S3://bucket/path/ADI-file.  For  more   information
                     about  the  metadata  .zip file, see the setting Metadata
                     destination.

                 AssetId -> (string)
                     Use the asset ID that you provide to Nielsen to  uniquely
                     identify  this asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear
                     watermarking.

                 AssetName -> (string)
                     Use the asset name that you provide to Nielsen  for  this
                     asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 CbetSourceId -> (string)
                     Use  the  CSID  that  Nielsen  provides to you. This CBET
                     source ID should be unique to your  Nielsen  account  but
                     common to all of your output assets that have CBET water-
                     marking. Required when you choose a value for the setting
                     Watermark types that includes CBET.

                 EpisodeId -> (string)
                     Optional.  If this asset uses an episode ID with Nielsen,
                     provide it here.

                 MetadataDestination -> (string)
                     Specify the Amazon S3 location where you  want  MediaCon-
                     vert  to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip file.
                     This Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region  as  the
                     one  where  you  do your MediaConvert transcoding. If you
                     want to include an ADI file in this .zip  file,  use  the
                     setting ADI file to specify it. MediaConvert delivers the
                     Nielsen metadata .zip files only to your metadata  desti-
                     nation  Amazon  S3  bucket.  It  doesn't deliver the .zip
                     files to Nielsen. You are responsible for delivering  the
                     metadata .zip files to Nielsen.

                 SourceId -> (integer)
                     Use  the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source ID
                     should be unique to your Nielsen account  but  common  to
                     all  of  your  output  assets.  Required  for all Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. This ID should be unique to your
                     Nielsen  account but common to all of your output assets.
                     Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                     Required. Specify whether  your  source  content  already
                     contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this
                     value to Watermarked, the service fails the job.  Nielsen
                     requires  that  you  add  non-linear watermarking to only
                     clean  content  that  doesn't  already  have   non-linear
                     Nielsen watermarks.

                 TicServerUrl -> (string)
                     Specify the endpoint for the TIC server that you have de-
                     ployed and configured in the AWS Cloud. Required for  all
                     Nielsen  non-linear watermarking. MediaConvert can't con-
                     nect directly to a TIC server. Instead, you must use  API
                     Gateway  to provide a RESTful interface between MediaCon-
                     vert and a TIC server that you deploy  in  your  AWS  ac-
                     count.  For more information on deploying a TIC server in
                     your AWS account and the required  API  Gateway,  contact
                     Nielsen support.

                 UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                     To  create  assets  that have the same TIC values in each
                     audio track, keep the default value Share TICs. To create
                     assets  that have unique TIC values for each audio track,
                     choose Use unique TICs.

              OutputGroups -> (list)
                 Contains one group of settings for each set of  outputs  that
                 share  a  common  package type. All unpackaged files (MPEG-4,
                 MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF, and no container) are grouped in a
                 single  output  group as well. Required in is a group of set-
                 tings that apply to the whole group. This required object de-
                 pends  on  the  value you set for Type. Type, settings object
                 pairs are as follows.  *  FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS,  FileGroupSet-
                 tings     *     HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,     HlsGroupSettings    *

                     AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                        Use automated encoding  to  have  MediaConvert  choose
                        your  encoding settings for you, based on characteris-
                        tics of your input video.

                        AbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up  the
                            renditions  in  your ABR package for you automati-
                            cally, based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                            video.  This feature optimizes video quality while
                            minimizing the overall size of your ABR package.

                            MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the maximum average bitrate for  Media-
                               Convert  to use in your automated ABR stack. If
                               you don't specify a  value,  MediaConvert  uses
                               8,000,000  (8 mb/s) by default. The average bi-
                               trate of your highest-quality rendition will be
                               equal  to or below this value, depending on the
                               quality, complexity,  and  resolution  of  your
                               content.  Note  that  the instantaneous maximum
                               bitrate may vary above the value that you spec-
                               ify.

                            MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum number of renditions that
                               MediaConvert will create in your automated  ABR
                               stack.  The  number of renditions is determined
                               automatically, based on analysis of  each  job,
                               but  will never exceed this limit. When you set
                               this to Auto in the console, which  is  equiva-
                               lent  to excluding it from your JSON job speci-
                               fication, MediaConvert defaults to a  limit  of
                               15.

                            MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify  the minimum average bitrate for Media-
                               Convert to use in your automated ABR stack.  If
                               you  don't  specify  a value, MediaConvert uses
                               600,000 (600 kb/s) by default. The average  bi-
                               trate  of your lowest-quality rendition will be
                               near this value. Note  that  the  instantaneous
                               minimum  bitrate  may vary below the value that
                               you specify.

                            Rules -> (list)
                               Optional. Use Automated ABR  rules  to  specify
                               restrictions  for the rendition sizes MediaCon-
                               vert will create in your ABR stack. You can use
                               these  rules  if your ABR workflow has specific
                               rendition size requirements, but you still want
                               MediaConvert  to optimize for video quality and
                               overall file size.

                                             Use  Height  to  define the video
                                             resolution height, in pixels, for
                                             this rule.

                                          Width -> (integer)
                                             Use  Width  to  define  the video
                                             resolution width, in pixels,  for
                                             this rule.

                                   MinBottomRenditionSize -> (structure)
                                      Use Min bottom rendition size to specify
                                      a minimum size for the lowest resolution
                                      in  your ABR stack. * The lowest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter. For example: If you specify 640x360
                                      the  lowest resolution in your ABR stack
                                      will be equal  to  or  greater  than  to
                                      640x360. * If you specify a Min top ren-
                                      dition size rule,  the  value  that  you
                                      specify  for  Min  bottom rendition size
                                      must be less than, or equal to, Min  top
                                      rendition size.

                                      Height -> (integer)
                                          Use Height to define the video reso-
                                          lution height, in pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                      Width -> (integer)
                                          Use  Width to define the video reso-
                                          lution width, in  pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                   MinTopRenditionSize -> (structure)
                                      Use  Min top rendition size to specify a
                                      minimum size for the highest  resolution
                                      in your ABR stack. * The highest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter.  For  example:   If   you   specify
                                      1280x720  the highest resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  1280x720. * If you specify a value
                                      for Max resolution, the value  that  you
                                      specify  for Min top rendition size must
                                      be less than, or equal to,  Max  resolu-
                                      tion.

                                      Height -> (integer)
                                          Use Height to define the video reso-
                                          lution height, in pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                      Width -> (integer)
                                          Use  Width to define the video reso-
                                          lution width, in  pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      Use  Min top rendition size to specify a
                                      minimum size for the highest  resolution
                                      in your ABR stack. * The highest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter.  For  example:   If   you   specify
                                      1280x720  the highest resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  1280x720. * If you specify a value
                                      for Max resolution, the value  that  you
                                      specify  for Min top rendition size must
                                      be less than, or equal to,  Max  resolu-
                                      tion.  Use  Min bottom rendition size to
                                      specify a minimum size  for  the  lowest
                                      resolution in your ABR stack. * The low-
                                      est resolution in your ABR stack will be
                                      equal  to or greater than the value that
                                      you enter. For example: If  you  specify
                                      640x360  the  lowest  resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  to 640x360. * If you specify a Min
                                      top rendition size rule, the value  that
                                      you  specify  for  Min  bottom rendition
                                      size must be less than, or equal to, Min
                                      top  rendition  size.  Use Force include
                                      renditions to specify one or more  reso-
                                      lutions  to  include  your  ABR stack. *
                                      (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR,
                                      specify  as few resolutions as possible.
                                      * (Required) The number  of  resolutions
                                      that  you  specify  must be equal to, or
                                      less than, the Max renditions setting. *
                                      If  you specify a Min top rendition size
                                      rule, specify at  least  one  resolution
                                      that  is  equal to, or greater than, Min
                                      top rendition size. * If you  specify  a
                                      Min  bottom  rendition  size  rule, only
                                      specify resolutions that are  equal  to,
                                      or  greater  than,  Min bottom rendition
                                      size. * If you specify a  Force  include
                                      renditions  rule, do not specify a sepa-
                                      rate  rule  for  Allowed  renditions.  *
                                      Note:  The  ABR  stack may include other
                                      resolutions  that  you  do  not  specify
                                      here,  depending  on  the Max renditions
                                      setting. Use Allowed renditions to spec-
                                      ify  a  list  of possible resolutions in
                                      your ABR stack. * (Required) The  number
                                      of  resolutions that you specify must be
                                      equal to, or greater than, the Max  ren-
                                      ditions  setting.  *  MediaConvert  will
                                      create an ABR stack exclusively from the
                                      list  of resolutions that you specify. *
                                      Some resolutions in the  Allowed  rendi-
                                      tions  list may not be included, however
                                      you can force a  resolution  to  be  in-
                                      cluded by setting Required to ENABLED. *
                                      You must specify at least one resolution
                                      that  is  greater  than  or equal to any
                                      resolutions that you specify in Min  top
                                      rendition  size  or Min bottom rendition
                                      size. * If you  specify  Allowed  rendi-
                                      tions,  you  must not specify a separate
                                      rule for Force include renditions.

                     CustomName -> (string)
                        Use Custom Group Name to specify a name for the output
                        group.  This value is displayed on the console and can
                        make your job settings JSON  more  human-readable.  It
                        does not affect your outputs. Use up to twelve charac-

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top -level .mpd DASH
                               manifest for each CMAF  output  group  in  your
                               job.  These  default  manifests reference every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional  top-level  manifests  that  reference a
                               subset of the  outputs  in  the  output  group,
                               specify  a  list  of  them here. For each addi-
                               tional manifest that you specify,  the  service
                               creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for each pair of HLS
                                   and DASH additional manifests that you want
                                   the  service to generate for this CMAF out-
                                   put group. Each pair of manifests can  ref-
                                   erence a different subset of outputs in the
                                   group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  HLS  group is
                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8. For HLS output groups,  spec-
                                      ify  a manifestNameModifier that is dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put.  The  service  uses the output name
                                      modifier to create unique names for  the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up, choose  Amazon  S3.
                                          If  you  want  your master key to be
                                          managed by AWS Key  Management  Ser-
                                          vice  (KMS),  choose AWS KMS. By de-

                                          uses the AWS managed customer master
                                          key (CMK) associated with Amazon  S3
                                          to  encrypt  your data keys. You can
                                          optionally choose to specify a  dif-
                                          ferent,  customer managed CMK. Do so
                                          by specifying  the  Amazon  Resource

                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8

                               Type -> (string)
                                   Specify  whether your DRM encryption key is
                                   static or from a key provider that  follows
                                   the  SPEKE  standard.  For more information

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole  seconds,  of  the
                               mp4  fragments. When you don't specify a value,
                               MediaConvert defaults to  2.  Related  setting:
                               Use  Fragment length control to specify whether
                               the encoder enforces this value strictly.

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert  generates  images
                               for  trick  play. Keep the default value, None,
                               to not generate any images. Choose Thumbnail to
                               generate tiled thumbnails. Choose Thumbnail and
                               full frame to  generate  tiled  thumbnails  and
                               full-resolution  images  of single frames. When
                               you enable  Write  HLS  manifest,  MediaConvert
                               creates a child manifest for each set of images
                               that you generate and  adds  corresponding  en-
                               tries  to  the parent manifest. When you enable
                               Write DASH manifest, MediaConvert adds an entry
                               in  the  .mpd  manifest  for each set of images
                               that you generate.  A  common  application  for
                               these images is Roku trick mode. The thumbnails

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job  will be rejected. Must be divisible by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  output manifest should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum time of initially buffered  media  that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set. If you know that player devices are  hang-
                               ing  on the final segment of your video because
                               the length of your final segment is too  short,
                               use  this  setting  to  specify a minimum final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is  greater  than  or  equal to 1 and less than
                               your segment length. When you specify  a  value
                               for  this setting, the encoder will combine any
                               final segment that is shorter than  the  length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example, your segment length is 3  seconds  and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum final segment length;  when  you  set  the
                               minimum  final  segment length to 1, your final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdManifestBandwidthType -> (string)
                               Specify how the value for bandwidth  is  deter-
                               mined  for  each  video  Representation in your
                               output MPD  manifest.  We  recommend  that  you
                               choose  a  MPD  manifest bandwidth type that is
                               compatible with your downstream player configu-
                               ration.  Max: Use the same value that you spec-
                               ify for Max bitrate in  the  video  output,  in
                               bits  per  second.  Average: Use the calculated
                               average bitrate of the encoded video output, in
                               bits per second.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand
                               or main. When you choose Main profile, the ser-
                               vice                                    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd  DASH manifest. When you choose On-demand,
                               the               service               signals

                               your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you  must
                               also  set the output group setting Segment con-
                               trol to Single file.

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when  your  output  video
                               stream  has  B-frames, which causes the initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the  initial  decode  time stamp (DTS). Specify
                               how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing  time
                               stamps  in  output DASH manifests. Choose Match
                               initial PTS when you want MediaConvert  to  use
                               the  initial PTS as the first time stamp in the
                               manifest. Choose Zero-based to  have  MediaCon-
                               vert ignore the initial PTS in the video stream
                               and instead write the  initial  time  stamp  as
                               zero  in  the  manifest. For outputs that don't
                               have B-frames, the time  stamps  in  your  DASH
                               manifests  start  at  zero  regardless  of your
                               choice here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single  output  file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing the Fragment  Length  and  Segment  Length.
                               When  set  to SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control to specify whether the
                               encoder enforces this value strictly. Use  Seg-
                               ment  control  to  specify whether MediaConvert
                               creates separate segment files or  one  content
                               file  that  has  metadata  to  mark the segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose Exact to have the
                               encoder use the exact length that  you  specify
                               with the setting Segment length. This might re-
                               sult in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of  GOP
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute  for

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is  always  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value above its current value in seconds.  When
                               set  to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target du-
                               ration is rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  if  fraction seconds are greater than or
                               equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if  less
                               than  0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration  is  always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-
                               perience  interrupted  playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            VideoCompositionOffsets -> (string)
                               Specify  the video sample composition time off-
                               set mode in the output fMP4 TRUN box. For wider
                               player  compatibility,  set  Video  composition
                               offsets to Unsigned or leave blank. The  earli-
                               est presentation time may be greater than zero,
                               and sample composition time offsets will incre-
                               ment  using  unsigned integers. For strict fMP4
                               video and audio timing, set  Video  composition
                               offsets  to  Signed.  The earliest presentation
                               time will be equal to zero, and sample composi-
                               tion  time  offsets will increment using signed
                               integers.

                            WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, a DASH MPD  manifest  will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               When you enable  Precise  segment  duration  in
                               DASH  manifests,  your DASH manifest shows pre-
                               cise segment durations.  The  segment  duration
                               information  appears inside the SegmentTimeline
                               element, inside SegmentTemplate at  the  Repre-
                               sentation  level.  When  this feature isn't en-
                               abled, the segment durations in your DASH mani-
                               fest  are approximate. The segment duration in-
                               formation appears in the duration attribute  of
                               the SegmentTemplate element.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates one  .mpd  DASH
                               manifest for each DASH ISO output group in your
                               job. This  default  manifest  references  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional DASH manifests that reference  a  subset
                               of  the  outputs in the output group, specify a
                               list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the  details  for  each  additional
                                   DASH  manifest that you want the service to
                                   generate for this output group. Each  mani-
                                   fest  can  reference  a different subset of
                                   outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  DASH group is
                                      film-name.mpd. If  you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.mpd.

                            AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when your audio codec  is
                               a  Dolby  one  (AC3,  EAC3,  or Atmos) and your
                               downstream workflow  requires  that  your  DASH
                               manifest  use  the  Dolby channel configuration
                               tag, rather than the MPEG one. For example, you
                               might  need  to use this to make dynamic ad in-
                               sertion work. Specify which audio channel  con-
                               figuration scheme ID URI MediaConvert writes in

                               Choose Dolby channel configuration to have  Me-
                               diaConvert       write       this      instead:
                               tag:dolby.com,2014:dash:audio_channel_configuration:2011.

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in the
                               manifest (.mpd) file at the top  level  BaseURL
                               element.  Can  be used if streams are delivered
                               from a different URL than the manifest file.

                            DashManifestStyle -> (string)
                               Specify how MediaConvert writes SegmentTimeline
                               in  your  output DASH manifest. To write a Seg-
                               mentTimeline in each video Representation: Keep
                               the  default  value,  Basic.  To write a common
                               SegmentTimeline  in  the  video  AdaptationSet:
                               Choose  Compact.  Note  that  MediaConvert will
                               still write a SegmentTimeline in any  Represen-
                               tation  that  does not share a common timeline.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination to specify the S3 output  loca-
                               tion  and the output filename base. Destination
                               accepts format identifiers. If you do not spec-
                               ify  the  base filename in the URI, the service
                               will use the filename of  the  input  file.  If
                               your  job has multiple inputs, the service uses
                               the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses data keys to en-
                                          crypt your  content.  AWS  also  en-

                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then  stores the encrypted data keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use  this  setting  to specify which
                                          AWS service  manages  the  CMK.  For
                                          simplest  set  up, choose Amazon S3.
                                          If you want your master  key  to  be
                                          managed  by  AWS Key Management Ser-
                                          vice (KMS), choose AWS KMS.  By  de-
                                          fault,  when you choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                          uses the AWS managed customer master
                                          key  (CMK) associated with Amazon S3
                                          to encrypt your data keys.  You  can
                                          optionally  choose to specify a dif-
                                          ferent, customer managed CMK. Do  so
                                          by  specifying  the  Amazon Resource

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          to AWS KMS. If you  set  Server-side
                                          encryption  to  AWS  KMS  but  don't
                                          specify a CMK here, AWS uses the AWS
                                          managed  CMK  associated with Amazon
                                          S3.

                                   StorageClass -> (string)
                                      Specify the S3 storage class to use  for
                                      this destination.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               DRM settings.

                               PlaybackDeviceCompatibility -> (string)
                                   This  setting can improve the compatibility
                                   of your output with video players on  obso-
                                   lete devices. It applies only to DASH H.264
                                   outputs with DRM encryption.  Choose  Unen-
                                   crypted  SEI  only to correct problems with
                                   playback on older devices. Otherwise,  keep
                                   the  default setting CENC v1. If you choose
                                   Unencrypted SEI, for that output, the  ser-
                                   vice will exclude the access unit delimiter
                                   and will leave  the  SEI  NAL  units  unen-
                                   crypted.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use these  settings  when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key provider. If your output group type  is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys that it provides to Me-
                                      diaConvert, set up a certificate with  a
                                      master  key  using  AWS Certificate Man-
                                      ager. Specify the  certificate's  Amazon
                                      Resource Name (ARN) here.

                                   ResourceId -> (string)
                                      Specify   the   resource  ID  that  your
                                      SPEKE-compliant  key  provider  uses  to
                                      identify this content.

                                   SystemIds -> (list)
                                      Relates  to  SPEKE  implementation.  DRM
                                      system identifiers. DASH  output  groups
                                      support  a  max of two system ids. Other
                                      group types support one system  id.  See
                                      https://dashif.org/identifiers/content_protection/

                                      (string)

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify the URL to the key  server  that
                                      your  SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your
                                      content.

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length  of  fragments to generate (in seconds).
                               Fragment length must  be  compatible  with  GOP
                               size  and  Framerate.  Note that fragments will
                               end on the next keyframe after this  number  of
                               seconds,  so  actual  fragment  length  may  be
                               longer. When Emit Single File is  checked,  the
                               fragmentation  is  internal  to a single output
                               file and it does not cause the creation of many
                               output files as in other output types.

                            HbbtvCompliance -> (string)
                               Supports HbbTV specification as indicated

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  MediaConvert generates images
                               for trick play. Keep the default  value,  None,
                               to not generate any images. Choose Thumbnail to
                               generate tiled thumbnails. Choose Thumbnail and
                               full  frame  to  generate  tiled thumbnails and
                               full-resolution images of single frames. Media-
                               Convert  adds an entry in the .mpd manifest for
                               each set of images that you generate. A  common
                               application  for  these  images  is  Roku trick
                               mode. The thumbnails and full-frame images that
                               MediaConvert creates with this feature are com-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job  will be rejected. Must be divisible by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set.  If you know that player devices are hang-
                               ing on the final segment of your video  because
                               the  length of your final segment is too short,
                               use this setting to  specify  a  minimum  final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is greater than or equal to  1  and  less  than
                               your  segment  length. When you specify a value
                               for this setting, the encoder will combine  any
                               final  segment  that is shorter than the length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example,  your  segment length is 3 seconds and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum  final  segment  length;  when you set the
                               minimum final segment length to 1,  your  final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdManifestBandwidthType -> (string)
                               Specify  how  the value for bandwidth is deter-
                               mined for each  video  Representation  in  your
                               output  MPD  manifest.  We  recommend  that you
                               choose a MPD manifest bandwidth  type  that  is
                               compatible with your downstream player configu-
                               ration. Max: Use the same value that you  spec-
                               ify  for  Max  bitrate  in the video output, in
                               bits per second. Average:  Use  the  calculated
                               average bitrate of the encoded video output, in
                               bits per second.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify whether your DASH profile is  on-demand
                               or main. When you choose Main profile, the ser-
                               vice                                    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd DASH manifest. When you choose  On-demand,
                               the               service               signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your  .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must
                               also set the output group setting Segment  con-
                               trol to Single file.

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting  only when your output video
                               stream has B-frames, which causes  the  initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the initial decode time  stamp  (DTS).  Specify
                               how  MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time
                               stamps in output DASH manifests.  Choose  Match
                               initial  PTS  when you want MediaConvert to use
                               the initial PTS as the first time stamp in  the
                               manifest.  Choose  Zero-based to have MediaCon-
                               vert ignore the initial PTS in the video stream
                               and  instead  write  the  initial time stamp as
                               zero in the manifest. For  outputs  that  don't
                               have  B-frames,  the  time  stamps in your DASH
                               manifests start  at  zero  regardless  of  your
                               choice here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing  the  Fragment  Length  and Segment Length.
                               When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 30. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length control to specify  whether  the
                               encoder  enforces this value strictly. Use Seg-
                               ment control to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length. Choose Exact  to  have  the
                               encoder  use  the exact length that you specify
                               with the setting Segment length. This might re-
                               sult  in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            VideoCompositionOffsets -> (string)
                               Specify  the video sample composition time off-
                               set mode in the output fMP4 TRUN box. For wider
                               player  compatibility,  set  Video  composition
                               offsets to Unsigned or leave blank. The  earli-
                               est presentation time may be greater than zero,
                               and sample composition time offsets will incre-
                               ment  using  unsigned integers. For strict fMP4
                               video and audio timing, set  Video  composition
                               offsets  to  Signed.  The earliest presentation
                               time will be equal to zero, and sample composi-
                               tion  time  offsets will increment using signed
                               integers.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               If you get an HTTP error in the 400 range  when
                               you  play  back  your  DASH output, enable this
                               setting and run  your  transcoding  job  again.
                               When  you  enable  this  setting,  the  service
                               writes precise segment durations  in  the  DASH
                               manifest.  The segment duration information ap-
                               pears inside the SegmentTimeline  element,  in-
                               side   SegmentTemplate  at  the  Representation
                               level. When you don't enable this setting,  the
                               service writes approximate segment durations in
                               your DASH manifest.

                        FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your File output group. Media-
                            Convert  uses this group of settings to generate a
                            single standalone file, rather  than  a  streaming
                            package.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use  Destination to specify the S3 output loca-
                               tion and the output filename base.  Destination
                               accepts format identifiers. If you do not spec-
                               ify the base filename in the URI,  the  service
                               will  use  the  filename  of the input file. If
                               your job has multiple inputs, the service  uses
                               the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up, choose  Amazon  S3.
                                          If  you  want  your master key to be
                                          managed by AWS Key  Management  Ser-
                                          vice  (KMS),  choose AWS KMS. By de-
                                          fault, when you choose AWS KMS,  KMS
                                          uses the AWS managed customer master
                                          key (CMK) associated with Amazon  S3
                                          to  encrypt  your data keys. You can
                                          optionally choose to specify a  dif-
                                          ferent,  customer managed CMK. Do so
                                          by specifying  the  Amazon  Resource
                                          Name  (ARN)  of the key for the set-
                                          ting KMS ARN.

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side encryption to  AWS  KMS.

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          to  AWS  KMS. If you set Server-side
                                          encryption  to  AWS  KMS  but  don't
                                          specify a CMK here, AWS uses the AWS
                                          managed CMK associated  with  Amazon
                                          S3.

                                   StorageClass -> (string)
                                      Specify  the S3 storage class to use for
                                      this destination.

                        HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your HLS output  package.  For

                            AdMarkers -> (list)
                               Choose  one or more ad marker types to decorate
                               your Apple HLS manifest. This setting does  not
                               determine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the
                               outputs themselves.

                               (string)
                                   Ad marker for Apple HLS manifest.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS output group in
                               your job. This default manifest references  ev-
                               ery output in the output group. To create addi-
                               tional top-level  manifests  that  reference  a
                               subset  of  the  outputs  in  the output group,
                               specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional HLS
                                   manifest  that you want the service to gen-
                                   erate for this output group. Each  manifest
                                   can reference a different subset of outputs
                                   in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to

                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-

                               will use the filename of  the  input  file.  If
                               your  job has multiple inputs, the service uses
                               the filename of the first input file.

                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses data keys to en-
                                          crypt your  content.  AWS  also  en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then  stores the encrypted data keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use  this  setting  to specify which
                                          AWS service  manages  the  CMK.  For
                                          simplest  set  up, choose Amazon S3.
                                          If you want your master  key  to  be
                                          managed  by  AWS Key Management Ser-
                                          vice (KMS), choose AWS KMS.  By  de-
                                          fault,  when you choose AWS KMS, KMS
                                          uses the AWS managed customer master
                                          key  (CMK) associated with Amazon S3
                                          to encrypt your data keys.  You  can
                                          optionally  choose to specify a dif-
                                          ferent, customer managed CMK. Do  so
                                          by  specifying  the  Amazon Resource

                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated  data  (AAD)  to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8

                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side  encryption  to AWS KMS.

                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          to AWS KMS. If you  set  Server-side

                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job  will be rejected. Must be divisible by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  output manifest should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set.  If you know that player devices are hang-
                               ing on the final segment of your video  because
                               the  length of your final segment is too short,
                               use this setting to  specify  a  minimum  final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is greater than or equal to  1  and  less  than
                               your  segment  length. When you specify a value
                               for this setting, the encoder will combine  any
                               final  segment  that is shorter than the length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example,  your  segment length is 3 seconds and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum  final  segment  length;  when you set the
                               minimum final segment length to 1,  your  final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                               When  set,  Minimum Segment Size is enforced by
                               looking ahead and  back  within  the  specified
                               range for a nearby avail and extending the seg-
                               ment size if needed.

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  .m3u8  manifest   file
                               should be generated for this HLS output group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is  cal-
                               culated as follows: either the program date and
                               time are initialized using the  input  timecode
                               source,  or  the  time is initialized using the
                               input timecode source and the date is  initial-
                               ized using the timestamp_offset.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period  of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               entry, in seconds.

                            ProgressiveWriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert generates HLS man-

                               media  segments are written to your destination
                               S3 bucket. It then writes new updated manifests
                               after  each  additional segment is written. The
                               parent manifest includes the  latest  BANDWIDTH
                               and  AVERAGE-BANDWIDTH  attributes,  and  child
                               manifests include the  latest  available  media
                               segment.  When  your  job  completes, the final
                               child playlists include an  EXT-X-ENDLIST  tag.
                               To  generate  HLS  manifests only when your job
                               completes: Choose Disabled.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE,  emits  program  as  a
                               single   media   resource   (.ts)   file,  uses
                               #EXT-X-BYTERANGE  tags  to  index  segment  for
                               playback.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 10. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length control to specify  whether  the
                               encoder  enforces this value strictly. Use Seg-
                               ment control to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length. Choose Exact  to  have  the
                               encoder  use  the exact length that you specify
                               with the setting Segment length. This might re-
                               sult  in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  number  of segments to write to a
                               subdirectory before starting  a  new  one.  You
                               must  also set Directory structure to Subdirec-
                               tory per stream for this setting to have an ef-
                               fect.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for
                               video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant  mani-

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is always rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  above its current value in seconds. When
                               set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target  du-
                               ration  is  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration is always longer than the  actual  dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-
                               perience interrupted playback when  the  actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Specify the type of the ID3 frame  to  use  for
                               ID3  timestamps  in your output. To include ID3
                               timestamps: Specify PRIV or TDRL  and  set  ID3
                               metadata  to  Passthrough. To exclude ID3 time-
                               stamps: Set ID3 timestamp frame type to None.

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Specify the interval in seconds  to  write  ID3
                               timestamps  in your output. The first timestamp
                               starts at the output timecode and date, and in-
                               creases  incrementally with each ID3 timestamp.
                               To use the  default  interval  of  10  seconds:
                               Leave  blank.  To include this metadata in your
                               output: Set ID3 timestamp frame type to PRIV or
                               TDRL, and set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides  an  extra millisecond delta offset to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                        MsSmoothGroupSettings -> (structure)

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates one .ism Micro-
                               soft Smooth Streaming manifest for each  Micro-
                               soft Smooth Streaming output group in your job.
                               This default manifest references  every  output
                               in the output group. To create additional mani-
                               fests that reference a subset of the outputs in
                               the output group, specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional Mi-
                                   crosoft Smooth Streaming manifest that  you
                                   want  the service to generate for this out-
                                   put group. Each manifest  can  reference  a
                                   different subset of outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for your Microsoft  Smooth
                                      group  is  film-name.ismv.  If you enter
                                      "-no-premium" for this setting, then the
                                      file name the service generates for this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.ismv.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this
                                      additional top-level manifest to  refer-
                                      ence.

                            AudioDeduplication -> (string)
                               COMBINE_DUPLICATE_STREAMS   combines  identical
                               audio  encoding  settings  across  a  Microsoft
                               Smooth output group into a single audio stream.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use  Destination to specify the S3 output loca-
                               tion and the output filename base.  Destination
                               accepts format identifiers. If you do not spec-
                               ify the base filename in the URI,  the  service
                               will  use  the  filename  of the input file. If
                               your job has multiple inputs, the service  uses
                               the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-

                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up, choose  Amazon  S3.
                                          If  you  want  your master key to be
                                          managed by AWS Key  Management  Ser-
                                          vice  (KMS),  choose AWS KMS. By de-
                                          fault, when you choose AWS KMS,  KMS
                                          uses the AWS managed customer master
                                          key (CMK) associated with Amazon  S3
                                          to  encrypt  your data keys. You can
                                          optionally choose to specify a  dif-
                                          ferent,  customer managed CMK. Do so
                                          by specifying  the  Amazon  Resource

                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          to  AWS  KMS. If you set Server-side
                                          encryption  to  AWS  KMS  but  don't
                                          specify a CMK here, AWS uses the AWS

                               the value SpekeKeyProvider.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use these  settings  when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key provider. If your output group type  is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt

                               with the setting Fragment  length.  This  might
                               result  in  extra  I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                               GOP to have the encoder round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            ManifestEncoding -> (string)
                               Use  Manifest  encoding to specify the encoding
                               format for  the  server  and  client  manifest.
                               Valid options are utf8 and utf16.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Type  of output group (File group, Apple HLS, DASH
                            ISO, Microsoft Smooth Streaming, CMAF)

                     Outputs -> (list)
                        This object holds groups  of  encoding  settings,  one
                        group of settings per output.

                        (structure)
                            Each  output  in  your job is a collection of set-
                            tings that describes how you want MediaConvert  to
                            encode  a  single  output file or stream. For more
                            information,                                   see

                            AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                               Contains groups of audio encoding settings  or-
                               ganized by audio codec. Include one instance of
                               per output. Can contain multiple groups of  en-
                               coding settings.

                               (structure)
                                   Settings  related  to  one audio tab on the
                                   MediaConvert console. In your job JSON,  an
                                   instance  of AudioDescription is equivalent
                                   to one audio tab in the  console.  Usually,
                                   one audio tab corresponds to one output au-
                                   dio track. Depending on how you set up your
                                   input  audio  selectors and whether you use
                                   audio selector groups, one  audio  tab  can
                                   correspond  to  a  group  of  output  audio
                                   tracks.

                                   AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                      When you  mimic  a  multi-channel  audio
                                      layout    with   multiple   mono-channel
                                      tracks, you can tag each channel  layout
                                      manually. For example, you would tag the
                                      tracks that contain  your  left,  right,
                                      and  center  audio  with Left (L), Right
                                      (R), and Center (C), respectively.  When
                                      you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                                      labels your track as Center (C)  by  de-
                                      fault. To use audio layout tagging, your
                                      output must be  in  a  QuickTime  (.mov)
                                      container; your audio codec must be AAC,
                                      WAV, or AIFF; and you must set  up  your
                                      audio track to have only one channel.

                                      ChannelTag -> (string)
                                          You   can   add   a   tag  for  this
                                          mono-channel audio  track  to  mimic
                                          its  placement  in  a  multi-channel
                                          layout. For example, if  this  track
                                          is the left surround channel, choose
                                          Left surround (LS).

                                   AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                                      Advanced audio  normalization  settings.
                                      Ignore these settings unless you need to
                                      comply with a loudness standard.

                                          chooses  a  value  for you, based on
                                          the algorithm that  you  choose  for
                                          Algorithm.  If  you choose algorithm
                                          1770-1, the encoder will choose  -24
                                          LKFS;  otherwise,  the  encoder will
                                          choose -23 LKFS.

                                      within each input. For  example  if  you
                                      specify  "Audio  Selector  3",  then the
                                      third audio selector will be  used  from
                                      each input. If an input does not have an
                                      "Audio Selector 3", then the  audio  se-

                                      will be used. If there is no  audio  se-

                                   AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                                      When  set  to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input
                                      contains an  ISO  639  audio_type,  then

                                   CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  related to audio encoding. The
                                      settings in this group vary depending on
                                      the value that you choose for your audio
                                      codec.

                                      AacSettings -> (structure)
                                          Required when you set Codec  to  the
                                          value  AAC.  The service accepts one
                                          of two mutually exclusive groups  of
                                          AAC settings--VBR and CBR. To select
                                          one of these modes, set the value of
                                          Bitrate  control  mode  to  "VBR" or
                                          "CBR". In VBR mode, you control  the
                                          audio  quality  with the setting VBR
                                          quality. In CBR mode,  you  use  the
                                          setting  Bitrate. Defaults and valid
                                          values depend on  the  rate  control
                                          mode.

                                             must contain pre-mixed audio; the

                                             use  this  setting instead of the

                                             relative to those coordinates.

                                      trims  them to ensure that the total du-

                                      the  audio  stream  duration  is no more
                                      than one frame  longer  than  the  video
                                      stream.  MediaConvert applies audio pad-
                                      ding or trimming only to the end of  the
                                      last  segment  of the output. For unseg-

                                      ding  only  to the end of the file. When
                                      you keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                      discrepancies  between  audio  and video

                                      match values that  you  specify  in  the
                                      setting  Audio group ID for audio rendi-
                                      tions in the same output group  as  this
                                      video  rendition.  Default  behavior: If
                                      you don't specify anything here and  for
                                      Audio  group  ID, MediaConvert puts each
                                      audio variant in its own audio rendition
                                      group and associates it with every video
                                      variant. Each value in your list appears
                                      in  your  HLS  parent  manifest  in  the
                                      EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as  the  value  for
                                      the  AUDIO  attribute.  To  continue the
                                      previous example, say that the file name
                                      for  the  child  manifest for your video
                                      rendition   is   "amazing_video_1.m3u8".
                                      Then,  in  your  parent  manifest,  each
                                      value will  appear  on  separate  lines,
                                      like  this: #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="au-

                                      Use this setting to control  the  values
                                      that  MediaConvert puts in your HLS par-
                                      ent playlist to control how  the  client
                                      player  selects  which  audio  track  to
                                      play. The other options for this setting
                                      determine  the  values that MediaConvert
                                      writes for the  DEFAULT  and  AUTOSELECT
                                      attributes  of the EXT-X-MEDIA entry for

                                      variant in your output group. Choose Al-
                                      ternate audio, auto select, not  default
                                      to  set  DEFAULT=NO  and AUTOSELECT=YES.

                                      When you don't specify a value for  this
                                      setting, MediaConvert defaults to Alter-

                                      there  is  more than one variant in your
                                      output group, you must explicitly choose
                                      a value for this setting.

                                   DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                                      Specify whether to flag this audio track
                                      as descriptive video  service  (DVS)  in
                                      your   HLS  parent  manifest.  When  you
                                      choose Flag, MediaConvert  includes  the
                                      parameter CHARACTERISTICS="public.acces-
                                      sibility.describes-video"     in     the
                                      EXT-X-MEDIA  entry  for this track. When
                                      you keep the default choice, Don't flag,
                                      MediaConvert  leaves this parameter out.
                                      The DVS flag can help with accessibility

                                   IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                                      Choose Include to have MediaConvert gen-
                                      erate  an  HLS child manifest that lists
                                      only the I-frames for this rendition, in
                                      addition  to  your  regular manifest for
                                      this rendition. You might use this mani-
                                      fest  as part of a workflow that creates
                                      preview functions for your video. Media-
                                      Convert adds both the I-frame only child
                                      manifest and the regular child  manifest
                                      to  the  parent manifest. When you don't
                                      need the I-frame  only  child  manifest,
                                      keep the default value Exclude.

                                   KlvMetadata -> (string)
                                      To  include key-length-value metadata in

                                      to  Passthrough.  MediaConvert reads KLV
                                      metadata  present  in  your  input   and
                                      writes each instance to a separate event
                                      message box in the output, according  to
                                      MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV meta-
                                      data: Set KLV metadata insertion to None
                                      or leave blank.

                                      SCTE-35 markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT
                                      to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at
                                      the insertion points that you specify in

                                      atom  is  relocated  to the beginning of
                                      the archive as required for  progressive
                                      downloading. Otherwise it is placed nor-
                                      mally at the end.

                               M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                                   MPEG-2 TS container settings.  These  apply
                                   to  outputs in a File output group when the
                                   output's  container  is  MPEG-2   Transport
                                   Stream (M2TS). In these assets, data is or-
                                   ganized by the  program  map  table  (PMT).
                                   Each transport stream program contains sub-
                                   sets of data, including audio,  video,  and
                                   metadata. Each of these subsets of data has
                                   a numerical label called a  packet  identi-
                                   fier  (PID).  Each transport stream program
                                   corresponds to one MediaConvert output. The
                                   PMT  lists  the  types of data in a program
                                   along with their  PID.  Downstream  systems
                                   and  players  use  the program map table to
                                   look up the PID for each type  of  data  it
                                   accesses  and  then uses the PIDs to locate
                                   specific data within the asset.

                                   AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                      Selects between the DVB and ATSC  buffer
                                      models for Dolby Digital audio.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to very small duration  differences  be-
                                      tween  video  and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion, choose Match  video  duration.  In
                                      all other cases, keep the default value,
                                      Default codec duration. When you  choose
                                      Match  video duration, MediaConvert pads
                                      the output audio streams with silence or
                                      trims  them to ensure that the total du-
                                      ration of each audio stream is at  least
                                      as  long  as  the  total duration of the
                                      video stream. After padding or trimming,
                                      the  audio  stream  duration  is no more
                                      than one frame  longer  than  the  video
                                      stream.  MediaConvert applies audio pad-
                                      ding or trimming only to the end of  the
                                      last  segment  of the output. For unseg-
                                      mented outputs, MediaConvert  adds  pad-
                                      ding  only  to the end of the file. When
                                      you keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                      discrepancies  between  audio  and video
                                      duration will depend on your output  au-
                                      dio codec.

                                   AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                      The number of audio frames to insert for
                                      each PES packet.

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Specify the  packet  identifiers  (PIDs)
                                      for any elementary audio streams you in-
                                      clude in this output.  Specify  multiple
                                      PIDs  as  a  JSON  array. Default is the
                                      range 482-492.

                                      (integer)

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify the output bitrate of the trans-
                                      port  stream in bits per second. Setting
                                      to 0 lets the muxer automatically deter-
                                      mine the appropriate bitrate. Other com-
                                      mon values  are  3750000,  7500000,  and
                                      15000000.

                                   BufferModel -> (string)
                                      Controls  what  buffer  model to use for
                                      accurate interleaving. If set to  MULTI-
                                      PLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set
                                      to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                                      but  low-memory  devices may not be able
                                      to play back the stream  without  inter-
                                      ruptions.

                                   DataPTSControl -> (string)

                                      with Presentation Timestamp (PTS) values
                                      greater than or equal to the first video
                                      packet  PTS (MediaConvert drops captions
                                      and data packets with  lesser  PTS  val-
                                      ues).  Keep  the  default value to allow
                                      all PTS values.

                                      the video PID, or on both the video  PID
                                      and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when
                                      EBP segmentation markers are is selected
                                      (segmentationMarkers     is    EBP    or
                                      EBP_LEGACY).

                                   EsRateInPes -> (string)
                                      Controls whether to include the ES  Rate
                                      field in the PES header.

                                   ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                                      Keep  the  default value unless you know
                                      that your audio EBP markers  are  incor-
                                      rectly  appearing  before your video EBP
                                      markers. To correct  this  problem,  set
                                      this value to Force.

                                   FragmentTime -> (double)

                                   KlvMetadata -> (string)
                                      To include key-length-value metadata  in
                                      this  output: Set KLV metadata insertion
                                      to Passthrough. MediaConvert  reads  KLV
                                      metadata   present  in  your  input  and
                                      passes it through to the  output  trans-
                                      port  stream.  To exclude this KLV meta-
                                      data: Set KLV metadata insertion to None
                                      or leave blank.

                                   MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  maximum time, in millisec-
                                      onds, between Program  Clock  References
                                      (PCRs)   inserted   into  the  transport
                                      stream.

                                   MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                      When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary
                                      Points  do not come within the specified
                                      time interval of each other  by  looking
                                      ahead  at input video. If another EBP is
                                      going to come in  within  the  specified
                                      time  interval,  the  current EBP is not
                                      emitted, and the segment is  "stretched"
                                      to  the next marker. The lookahead value
                                      does not add latency to the system.  The
                                      Live  Event must be configured elsewhere
                                      to create sufficient latency to make the
                                      lookahead accurate.

                                   NielsenId3 -> (string)

                                      input  audio  and  an equivalent ID3 tag
                                      will be inserted in the output.

                                   NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                                      Value in bits per second of  extra  null
                                      packets  to  insert  into  the transport
                                      stream. This can be used if a downstream
                                      encryption system requires periodic null
                                      packets.

                                   PatInterval -> (integer)

                                      transport stream.

                                   PcrControl -> (string)
                                      When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Pro-
                                      gram  Clock  Reference value is inserted
                                      for every Packetized  Elementary  Stream
                                      (PES)  header.  This  is  effective only
                                      when the PCR PID  is  the  same  as  the
                                      video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PcrPid -> (integer)

                                      this  output.  If  you  do not specify a
                                      value, the service will  use  the  value
                                      for Video PID.

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  number of milliseconds be-
                                      tween instances of the program map table
                                      (PMT) in the output transport stream.

                                   PmtPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the packet identifier (PID) for

                                      Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) of
                                      the private metadata stream. Default  is
                                      503.

                                   ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use  Program  number to specify the pro-

                                      are  parts  of  MPEG-2  transport stream
                                      containers, used for organizing data.

                                   PtsOffset -> (integer)
                                      Manually specify the initial PTS offset,
                                      in  seconds,  when you set PTS offset to
                                      Seconds. Enter  an  integer  from  0  to
                                      3600.  Leave  blank  to keep the default
                                      value 2.

                                   PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                                      Specify the initial  presentation  time-
                                      stamp  (PTS)  offset  for your transport
                                      stream output. To let MediaConvert auto-
                                      matically determine the initial PTS off-
                                      set: Keep the default  value,  Auto.  We
                                      recommend  that  you choose Auto for the
                                      widest player compatibility. The initial
                                      PTS  will  be  at  least two seconds and
                                      vary depending on your output's bitrate,
                                      HRD  buffer  size and HRD buffer initial
                                      fill percentage. To manually specify  an
                                      initial PTS offset: Choose Seconds. Then
                                      specify the number of seconds  with  PTS
                                      offset.

                                   RateMode -> (string)
                                      When  set  to  CBR, inserts null packets
                                      into transport stream to fill  specified
                                      bitrate.  When  set  to VBR, the bitrate
                                      setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but
                                      the output will not be padded up to that
                                      bitrate.

                                      serted. When  a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "reset_cadence"  is  selected and a seg-
                                      ment is truncated due to  an  avail,  we
                                      will  reset  the  segmentation  cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      have a duration of of $segmentation_time
                                      seconds. When a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "maintain_cadence"  is  selected  and  a
                                      segment is truncated due to an avail, we
                                      will not reset the segmentation cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      likely  be  truncated  as well. However,
                                      all segments after that will have a  du-
                                      ration  of  $segmentation_time  seconds.
                                      Note that EBP lookahead is a slight  ex-
                                      ception to this rule.

                                   SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                      Specify  the length, in seconds, of each
                                      segment. Required unless markers is  set
                                      to _none_.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      Specify the ID for the transport  stream
                                      itself in the program map table for this
                                      output. Transport stream IDs and program
                                      map tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                      stream containers, used  for  organizing
                                      data.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) of
                                      the  elementary  video  stream  in   the
                                      transport stream.

                               M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                   These  settings relate to the MPEG-2 trans-
                                   port stream (MPEG2-TS)  container  for  the
                                   MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS outputs.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to very small duration  differences  be-
                                      tween  video  and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion, choose Match  video  duration.  In
                                      all other cases, keep the default value,
                                      Default codec duration. When you  choose
                                      Match  video duration, MediaConvert pads
                                      the output audio streams with silence or
                                      trims  them to ensure that the total du-
                                      ration of each audio stream is at  least
                                      as  long  as  the  total duration of the
                                      video stream. After padding or trimming,
                                      the  audio  stream  duration  is no more
                                      than one frame  longer  than  the  video
                                      stream.  MediaConvert applies audio pad-
                                      ding or trimming only to the end of  the
                                      last  segment  of the output. For unseg-
                                      mented outputs, MediaConvert  adds  pad-
                                      ding  only  to the end of the file. When
                                      you keep the default  value,  any  minor
                                      discrepancies  between  audio  and video
                                      duration will depend on your output  au-

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  elemen-
                                      tary  audio  stream(s)  in the transport
                                      stream. Multiple  values  are  accepted,
                                      and  can  be entered in ranges and/or by
                                      comma separation.

                                      with Presentation Timestamp (PTS) values
                                      greater than or equal to the first video
                                      packet PTS (MediaConvert drops  captions
                                      and  data  packets  with lesser PTS val-
                                      ues). Keep the default value AUTO to al-

                                      When  set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Pro-
                                      gram Clock Reference value  is  inserted
                                      for  every  Packetized Elementary Stream
                                      (PES) header. This parameter  is  effec-
                                      tive  only  when the PCR PID is the same
                                      as the video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PtsOffset -> (integer)
                                      Manually specify the initial PTS offset,
                                      in seconds, when you set PTS  offset  to
                                      Seconds.  Enter  an  integer  from  0 to
                                      3600. Leave blank to  keep  the  default
                                      value 2.

                                   PtsOffsetMode -> (string)

                                      set:  Keep  the  default value, Auto. We
                                      recommend that you choose Auto  for  the
                                      widest player compatibility. The initial
                                      PTS will be at  least  two  seconds  and
                                      vary depending on your output's bitrate,

                                      also appear in this output. Choose  None
                                      if  you  don't  want  SCTE-35 markers in
                                      this output. For SCTE-35 markers from an
                                      ESAM  XML  document-- Choose None if you
                                      don't want manifest conditioning. Choose
                                      Passthrough and choose Ad markers if you
                                      do want manifest conditioning.  In  both

                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 meta-
                                      data stream in the transport stream.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      The value of  the  transport  stream  ID
                                      field in the Program Map Table.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the elemen-
                                      tary  video  stream  in  the   transport

                               MovSettings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to your QuickTime MOV
                                   output container.

                                   ClapAtom -> (string)
                                      When enabled, include 'clap' atom if ap-
                                      propriate for the video output settings.

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the  'ctts' (composition time to sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a

                                      est) box will be  included  per  14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                      When set to XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2  video
                                      streams  into  the  QuickTime file using
                                      XDCAM fourcc codes. This increases  com-
                                      patibility  with Apple editors and play-
                                      ers, but may decrease compatibility with
                                      other  players. Only applicable when the
                                      video codec is MPEG2.

                                   PaddingControl -> (string)
                                      Unless you  need  Omneon  compatibility:
                                      Keep  the  default  value, None. To make
                                      this  output  compatible  with   Omneon:
                                      Choose Omneon. When you do, MediaConvert
                                      increases the length of the 'elst'  edit
                                      list  atom.  Note  that this might cause
                                      file rejections when a recipient of  the
                                      output  file  doesn't  expect this extra
                                      padding.

                                   Reference -> (string)
                                      Always keep the default value (SELF_CON-
                                      TAINED) for this setting.

                               Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                                   These  settings  relate  to your MP4 output

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to  very  small duration differences be-
                                      tween video and audio. For  this  situa-
                                      tion,  choose  Match  video duration. In
                                      all other cases, keep the default value,
                                      Default  codec duration. When you choose
                                      Match video duration, MediaConvert  pads
                                      the output audio streams with silence or
                                      trims them to ensure that the total  du-
                                      ration  of each audio stream is at least
                                      as long as the  total  duration  of  the
                                      video stream. After padding or trimming,
                                      the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                                      than  one  frame  longer  than the video
                                      stream. MediaConvert applies audio  pad-
                                      ding  or trimming only to the end of the
                                      last segment of the output.  For  unseg-
                                      mented  outputs,  MediaConvert adds pad-
                                      ding only to the end of the  file.  When
                                      you  keep  the  default value, any minor
                                      discrepancies between  audio  and  video
                                      duration  will depend on your output au-

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the 'ctts' (composition time to  sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a
                                      'cslg' (composition shift  least  great-
                                      est)  box  will  be included per 14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless compliance to
                                      the CTTS box version specification  mat-
                                      ters  in  your workflow. Specify a value
                                      of 1 to set your CTTS box version  to  1
                                      and  make your output compliant with the
                                      specification. When you specify a  value
                                      of 1, you must also set CSLG atom to the
                                      value INCLUDE. Keep the default value  0
                                      to  set your CTTS box version to 0. This
                                      can provide backward  compatibility  for
                                      some players and packagers.

                                   FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                                      Inserts a free-space box immediately af-

                                   MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                      If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV
                                      atom  is  relocated  to the beginning of
                                      the archive as required for  progressive
                                      downloading. Otherwise it is placed nor-

                                      Overrides the "Major Brand" field in the
                                      output  file.  Usually  not necessary to
                                      specify.

                               MpdSettings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to the fragmented MP4

                                      markup  isn't  generally  required,  but
                                      some video players require  it  to  dis-
                                      cover  and  play  embedded 608 captions.
                                      Keep  the  default  value,  Exclude,  to
                                      leave  these  elements out. When you en-

                                   CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                                      Use this setting  only  in  DASH  output

                               Use Name modifier to have  the  service  add  a
                               string  to the end of each output filename. You
                               specify the base filename as part of your  des-

                                   SegmentModifier -> (string)
                                      Use  this  setting to add an identifying
                                      string to the filename of each  segment.
                                      The service adds this string between the
                                      name modifier and segment index  number.
                                      You  can  use  format identifiers in the

                               coding settings. The  specific  video  settings
                               depend  on  the video codec that you choose for
                               the property codec.  Include  one  instance  of
                               VideoDescription per output.

                               AfdSignaling -> (string)
                                   This  setting only applies to H.264, H.265,
                                   and MPEG2 outputs. Use Insert AFD signaling
                                   to specify whether the service includes AFD
                                   values in the output video  data  and  what
                                   those  values  are. * Choose None to remove
                                   all AFD values from this output.  *  Choose

                                   job.  * Choose Auto to calculate output AFD
                                   values based on the input AFD scaler data.

                               AntiAlias -> (string)
                                   The anti-alias filter is automatically  ap-
                                   plied to all outputs. The service no longer
                                   accepts the value DISABLED  for  AntiAlias.
                                   If  you  specify that in your job, the ser-
                                   vice will ignore the setting.

                               CodecSettings -> (structure)
                                   Video codec settings contains the group  of
                                   settings  related  to  video  encoding. The
                                   settings in this group  vary  depending  on
                                   the  value that you choose for Video codec.
                                   For each codec enum that you choose, define

                                          a  smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For  complex frame rate conversions,
                                          especially if your source video  has
                                          already   been  converted  from  its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to  do motion-compensated interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version  method frame by frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify the GOP length (keyframe in-
                                          terval)  in frames. With AV1, Media-
                                          Convert doesn't support  GOP  length
                                          in   seconds.  This  value  must  be
                                          greater  than  zero  and  preferably
                                          equal  to 1 + ((numberBFrames + 1) *
                                          x), where x is an integer value.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify from the number of B-frames,
                                          in the range of 0-15. For AV1 encod-
                                          ing, we recommend  using  7  or  15.
                                          Choose  a  larger number for a lower
                                          bitrate  and  smaller   file   size;
                                          choose  a  smaller number for better
                                          video quality.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                          Settings for  quality-defined  vari-

                                          codec. Use these settings only  when
                                          you set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  to  QVBR.
                                             Specify  the target quality level
                                             for this output. MediaConvert de-
                                             termines the right number of bits
                                             to use for each part of the video
                                             to  maintain  the  video  quality
                                             that you specify. When  you  keep
                                             the  default  value, AUTO, Media-
                                             Convert picks a quality level for
                                             you,  based on characteristics of
                                             your input video. If  you  prefer
                                             to specify a quality level, spec-
                                             ify a number from 1  through  10.
                                             Use  higher  numbers  for greater
                                             quality.  Level  10  results   in
                                             nearly  lossless compression. The
                                             quality  level  for  most  broad-

                                             specify  a  value  between  whole
                                             numbers, also provide a value for

                                             Tune. For example,  if  you  want
                                             your  QVBR  quality  level  to be
                                             7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel  to  7
                                             and  set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune
                                             to .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set  the  QVBR quality to a level
                                             that is  between  whole  numbers.
                                             For  example,  if  you  want your
                                             QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,
                                             set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .33.
                                             MediaConvert   rounds  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  the   nearest
                                             third  of a whole number. For ex-

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,
                                             your actual QVBR quality level is
                                             7.33.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          'With AV1 outputs, for rate  control

                                      Slices -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  number  of  slices per
                                          picture. This value must be 1, 2, 4,
                                          8,  16,  or 32. For progressive pic-
                                          tures, this value must be less  than
                                          or equal to the number of macroblock
                                          rows. For interlaced pictures,  this
                                          value  must be less than or equal to
                                          half the number of macroblock rows.

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Enabled,  to
                                          adjust   quantization   within  each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                             quality is better and your output
                                             bitrate is  more  accurate.  That
                                             is,  the  actual  bitrate of your
                                             output is closer  to  the  target

                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing  the  frame rate. For nu-
                                          merically simple  conversions,  such
                                          as  60  fps  to 30 fps: We recommend
                                          that you  keep  the  default  value,
                                          Drop duplicate. For numerically com-
                                          plex conversions, to avoid  stutter:
                                          Choose  Interpolate. This results in
                                          a smooth picture, but  might  intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For complex frame rate  conversions,
                                          especially  if your source video has
                                          already  been  converted  from   its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to do motion-compensated  interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version method frame by frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant   add-on   cost.  When  you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  to  create  a  progressive
                                          output, regardless of the scan  type
                                          of  your  input. Use Top field first
                                          or Bottom field first to  create  an
                                          output  that's  interlaced  with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,  default  top or Follow, de-
                                          fault bottom to produce outputs with
                                          the   same  field  polarity  as  the
                                          source. For jobs that have  multiple
                                          inputs,  the  output  field polarity
                                          might change over the course of  the
                                          output.  Follow  behavior depends on
                                          the input scan type. If  the  source
                                          is  interlaced,  the  output will be
                                          interlaced with the same polarity as
                                          the  source.  If  the source is pro-
                                          gressive, the output will be  inter-
                                          laced  with  top  field bottom field
                                          first, depending  on  which  of  the
                                          Follow options you choose.

                                          basic interlacing, MediaConvert per-
                                          forms   any  frame  rate  conversion
                                          first  and   then   interlaces   the
                                          frames.  When  you  choose Optimized
                                          interlacing and you set your  output
                                          frame  rate  to  a  value that isn't
                                          suitable for optimized  interlacing,
                                          MediaConvert   automatically   falls

                                          settings: To use optimized interlac-
                                          ing, you must set Telecine  to  None
                                          or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                                          terlacing for hard telecine outputs.
                                          You  must also set Interlace mode to
                                          a value other than Progressive.

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore this setting unless your  in-

                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When
                                          you enable  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert
                                          relabels  the video frames to 25 fps
                                          and resamples your audio to keep  it
                                          synchronized  with  the  video. Note
                                          that  enabling  this  setting   will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video. Required settings:  You  must
                                          also set Framerate to 25.

                                             Low.  For  the most bandwidth re-
                                             duction, choose High.  We  recom-

                                          I-frame  pop  appears  as  a  visual

                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-

                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for

                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the

                                          Auto. If your output group specifies
                                          HLS,  DASH,  or CMAF, leave GOP size
                                          blank and set GOP  mode  control  to

                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto

                                          control, MediaConvert will use auto-
                                          matic behavior. If your output group
                                          specifies  HLS,  DASH,  or CMAF, set
                                          GOP mode control to Auto  and  leave

                                          initially   be  filled  (HRD  buffer

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)

                                          bits.   For   example,   enter  five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  to  create  a  progressive
                                          output,  regardless of the scan type
                                          of your input. Use Top  field  first
                                          or  Bottom  field first to create an
                                          output that's  interlaced  with  the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow, default top or  Follow,  de-
                                          fault bottom to produce outputs with
                                          the  same  field  polarity  as   the
                                          source.  For jobs that have multiple
                                          inputs, the  output  field  polarity
                                          might  change over the course of the
                                          output. Follow behavior  depends  on
                                          the  input  scan type. If the source
                                          is interlaced, the  output  will  be
                                          interlaced with the same polarity as
                                          the source. If the  source  is  pro-
                                          gressive,  the output will be inter-
                                          laced with top  field  bottom  field
                                          first,  depending  on  which  of the
                                          Follow options you choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting only when you also
                                          enable Scene change detection.  This
                                          setting  determines  how the encoder
                                          manages the spacing between I-frames
                                          that  it  inserts  as  part  of  the
                                          I-frame  cadence  and  the  I-frames
                                          that it inserts for Scene change de-
                                          tection. We recommend that you  have
                                          the  transcoder automatically choose
                                          this value for you based on  charac-
                                          teristics  of  your  input video. To
                                          enable this automatic  behavior,  do
                                          this  by  keeping  the default empty
                                          value. When you explicitly specify a
                                          value  for this setting, the encoder
                                          determines whether  to  skip  a  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frame  by  the value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval to 5 and a cadence-driven
                                          I-frame would fall within  5  frames
                                          of  a scene-change I-frame, then the
                                          encoder  skips  the   cadence-driven
                                          I-frame.  In  this  way,  one GOP is
                                          shrunk  slightly  and  one  GOP   is
                                          stretched  slightly.  When  the  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frames  are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          teristics  of  your  input video. To
                                          manually  specify  the   number   of

                                          The  encoder  may  use more than re-

                                          PAR  from  your input video for your
                                          output. To specify a  different  PAR
                                          in  the  console,  choose  any value
                                          other than Follow source.  When  you
                                          choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting,
                                          you must also specify values for the
                                          parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                                          tings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,

                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-

                                          the  encoder  uses. Keep the default
                                          value,  0,  for  flat  quantization.
                                          Choose  the value 1 or 16 to use the

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Only   use  this  setting  when  you
                                          change the default value, Auto,  for

                                          the  best  types of quantization for
                                          your video  content.  When  you  set
                                          H264AdaptiveQuantization  to a value
                                          other than AUTO, the  default  value
                                          for  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization
                                          is Enabled. Keep this default  value
                                          to  adjust  quantization within each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                          especially if your source video  has

                                          to  do motion-compensated interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version  method frame by frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          Specify whether to allow B-frames to
                                          be  referenced by other frame types.
                                          To use reference B-frames when  your
                                          GOP   structure   has   1   or  more
                                          B-frames: Leave blank  or  keep  the
                                          default  value Enabled. We recommend
                                          that you choose Enabled to help  im-
                                          prove the video quality of your out-
                                          put relative to its bitrate. To  not
                                          use  reference B-frames: Choose Dis-

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic behavior, do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP  mode  control   to   Specified,
                                          frames  or Specified, seconds. Spec-

                                          number  of frames or a decimal value
                                          of seconds. MediaConvert will inter-
                                          pret this value as frames or seconds
                                          depending on the  value  you  choose
                                          for GOP mode control. If you want to
                                          allow MediaConvert to  automatically
                                          determine  GOP  size, leave GOP size
                                          blank and set GOP  mode  control  to
                                          Auto. If your output group specifies
                                          HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave  GOP  size
                                          blank  and  set  GOP mode control to
                                          Auto in each output in  your  output
                                          group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify  how  the  transcoder deter-
                                          mines GOP size for this  output.  We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          and and leave GOP size blank. By de-
                                          fault, if you don't specify GOP mode
                                          control, MediaConvert will use auto-
                                          matic behavior. If your output group
                                          specifies HLS, DASH,  or  CMAF,  set
                                          GOP  mode  control to Auto and leave
                                          GOP size blank  in  each  output  in
                                          your  output  group.  To  explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified,  frames or Specified, seconds
                                          and then provide the GOP  length  in

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  to  create  a  progressive

                                          of  your  input. Use Top field first
                                          or Bottom field first to  create  an
                                          output  that's  interlaced  with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use

                                          inputs,  the  output  field polarity
                                          might change over the course of  the
                                          output.  Follow  behavior depends on
                                          the input scan type. If  the  source
                                          is  interlaced,  the  output will be
                                          interlaced with the same polarity as
                                          the  source.  If  the source is pro-
                                          gressive, the output will be  inter-

                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable  Scene change detection. This
                                          setting determines how  the  encoder
                                          manages the spacing between I-frames
                                          that  it  inserts  as  part  of  the
                                          I-frame  cadence  and  the  I-frames
                                          that it inserts for Scene change de-
                                          tection.  We recommend that you have
                                          the transcoder automatically  choose
                                          this  value for you based on charac-
                                          teristics of your  input  video.  To
                                          enable  this  automatic behavior, do
                                          this by keeping  the  default  empty
                                          value. When you explicitly specify a
                                          value for this setting, the  encoder
                                          determines  whether  to  skip  a ca-
                                          dence-driven I-frame  by  the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval to 5 and a cadence-driven
                                          I-frame  would  fall within 5 frames
                                          of a scene-change I-frame, then  the
                                          encoder   skips  the  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame. In this  way,  one  GOP  is
                                          shrunk   slightly  and  one  GOP  is
                                          stretched  slightly.  When  the  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frames  are  farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          teristics of your  input  video.  To
                                          manually   specify   the  number  of
                                          B-frames between  reference  frames:
                                          Enter an integer from 0 to 7.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number  of  reference frames to use.
                                          The encoder may use  more  than  re-

                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source,  uses the
                                          PAR from your input video  for  your
                                          output.  To specify a different PAR,
                                          choose any value other  than  Follow
                                          source.  When  you  choose SPECIFIED
                                          for  this  setting,  you  must  also
                                          specify  values for the parNumerator
                                          and parDenominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect

                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting only  when  Rate

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore  this setting unless your in-
                                          put  frame  rate  is  23.976  or  24
                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it
                                          synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                                          that   enabling  this  setting  will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video.  Required  settings: You must
                                          also set Framerate to 25.

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Enabled,  to
                                          adjust   quantization   within  each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the
                                          viewer's  attention is likely to be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing
                                          their  attention  on  a  part of the

                                          frame based on temporal variation of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on  areas  of  the  frame that
                                          aren't moving and uses more bits  on
                                          complex  objects  with  sharp  edges
                                          that move a lot. For  example,  this
                                          feature  improves the readability of

                                          in  the  encoded  bitstream. Up to 3
                                          layers are  supported  depending  on
                                          GOP  structure: I- and P-frames form
                                          one layer,  reference  B-frames  can
                                          form  a  second layer and non-refer-
                                          ence  b-frames  can  form  a   third
                                          layer.  Decoders  can optionally de-
                                          code only the lower temporal  layers
                                          to  generate a lower frame rate out-
                                          put. For example, given a  bitstream
                                          with  temporal IDs and with b-frames
                                          = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display  order),  a
                                          decoder  could decode all the frames
                                          for full frame rate output  or  only
                                          the  I and P frames (lowest temporal
                                          layer) for a half frame rate output.

                                      Tiles -> (string)
                                          Enable use of tiles, allowing  hori-
                                          zontal  as well as vertical subdivi-

                                      UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                                          Inserts timecode for each frame as 4
                                          bytes  of  an  unregistered SEI mes-

                                      WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                                          If the location of parameter set NAL
                                          units  doesn't  matter in your work-
                                          flow, ignore this setting. Use  this
                                          setting  only with CMAF or DASH out-

                                          outputs). Choose HVC1 to  mark  your
                                          output as HVC1. This makes your out-
                                          put  compliant  with  the  following
                                          specification:   ISO   IECJTC1  SC29
                                          N13798 Text  ISO/IEC  FDIS  14496-15
                                          3rd  Edition. For these outputs, the
                                          service  stores  parameter  set  NAL
                                          units  in the sample headers but not
                                          in the  samples  directly.  For  MP4
                                          outputs,  when you choose HVC1, your
                                          output video might not work properly
                                          with  some  downstream  systems  and
                                          video players. The service  defaults
                                          to  marking your output as HEV1. For
                                          these outputs,  the  service  writes
                                          parameter  set  NAL  units  directly
                                          into the samples.

                                   Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required when you set Codec to the value
                                      MPEG2.

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Specify the strength of any adaptive
                                          quantization filters  that  you  en-
                                          able. The value that you choose here
                                          applies to the  following  settings:
                                          Spatial  adaptive  quantization, and
                                          Temporal adaptive quantization.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Specify the average bitrate in  bits
                                          per  second.  Required  for  VBR and
                                          CBR. For MS Smooth outputs, bitrates
                                          must  be unique when rounded down to
                                          the nearest multiple of 1000.

                                      CodecLevel -> (string)
                                          Use Level to set  the  MPEG-2  level
                                          for the video output.

                                      CodecProfile -> (string)
                                          Use  Profile  to set the MPEG-2 pro-
                                          file for the video output.

                                      DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                                          Choose Adaptive to  improve  subjec-
                                          tive  video  quality for high-motion
                                          content. This will cause the service
                                          to  use  fewer B-frames (which infer
                                          information based on  other  frames)
                                          for   high-motion  portions  of  the
                                          video and more B-frames for  low-mo-
                                          tion portions. The maximum number of
                                          B-frames is limited by the value you
                                          provide for the setting B frames be-
                                          tween reference frames.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose the method that you want  Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate.  For  nu-
                                          merically  simple  conversions, such
                                          as 60 fps to 30  fps:  We  recommend
                                          that  you  keep  the  default value,
                                          Drop duplicate. For numerically com-
                                          plex  conversions, to avoid stutter:
                                          Choose Interpolate. This results  in
                                          a  smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For  complex frame rate conversions,
                                          especially if your source video  has
                                          already   been  converted  from  its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to  do motion-compensated interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version  method frame by frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a

                                          When  you create a streaming output,
                                          we recommend that you keep  the  de-
                                          fault  value,  1,  so  that  players
                                          starting mid-stream receive  an  IDR
                                          frame  as quickly as possible. Don't
                                          set this  value  to  0;  that  would
                                          break output segmenting.

                                      GopSize -> (double)

                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  to  create  a  progressive
                                          output, regardless of the scan  type
                                          of  your  input. Use Top field first
                                          or Bottom field first to  create  an
                                          output  that's  interlaced  with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,  default  top or Follow, de-
                                          fault bottom to produce outputs with
                                          the   same  field  polarity  as  the
                                          source. For jobs that have  multiple
                                          inputs,  the  output  field polarity
                                          might change over the course of  the
                                          output.  Follow  behavior depends on
                                          the input scan type. If  the  source
                                          is  interlaced,  the  output will be
                                          interlaced with the same polarity as
                                          the  source.  If  the source is pro-
                                          gressive, the output will be  inter-
                                          laced  with  top  field bottom field
                                          first, depending  on  which  of  the
                                          Follow options you choose.

                                      IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                          Use  Intra DC precision to set quan-
                                          tization precision  for  intra-block
                                          DC  coefficients.  If you choose the
                                          value auto, the service  will  auto-
                                          matically select the precision based
                                          on the per-frame compression ratio.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable  Scene change detection. This
                                          setting determines how  the  encoder
                                          manages the spacing between I-frames
                                          that  it  inserts  as  part  of  the
                                          I-frame  cadence  and  the  I-frames
                                          that it inserts for Scene change de-
                                          tection.  When  you  specify a value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines   whether   to   skip   a  ca-
                                          dence-driven I-frame  by  the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval to 5 and a cadence-driven
                                          I-frame  would  fall within 5 frames
                                          of a scene-change I-frame, then  the
                                          encoder   skips  the  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame. In this  way,  one  GOP  is
                                          shrunk   slightly  and  one  GOP  is
                                          stretched  slightly.  When  the  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frames  are  farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify the number of B-frames  that
                                          MediaConvert  puts between reference
                                          frames in this output. Valid  values
                                          are  whole numbers from 0 through 7.
                                          When you don't specify a value,  Me-
                                          diaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior, Follow  source,  uses  the
                                          PAR  from  your input video for your
                                          output. To specify a  different  PAR
                                          in  the  console,  choose  any value
                                          other than Follow source.  When  you
                                          choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting,
                                          you must also specify values for the
                                          parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                                          tings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parNumerator is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          to  choose how you want to trade off
                                          encoding  speed  for  output   video
                                          quality.  The  default  behavior  is
                                          faster, lower  quality,  single-pass
                                          encoding.

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half  of  your  input frame rate. In
                                          this situation, choose Optimized in-
                                          terlacing to create a better quality
                                          interlaced  output.  In  this  case,
                                          each  progressive frame from the in-
                                          put  corresponds  to  an  interlaced

                                          frame  rate  to  a  value that isn't
                                          suitable for optimized  interlacing,

                                          you enable  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert
                                          relabels  the video frames to 25 fps
                                          and resamples your audio to keep  it
                                          synchronized  with  the  video. Note
                                          that  enabling  this  setting   will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video. Required settings:  You  must

                                      Softness -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this setting unless you need
                                          to comply with a specification  that
                                          requires  a  specific  value. If you
                                          don't have a specification  require-
                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness or by enabling a noise  reducer
                                          filter.  The Softness setting speci-
                                          fies the quantization matrices  that
                                          the  encoder  uses. Keep the default
                                          value, 0, to use the  AWS  Elemental
                                          default  matrices.  Choose  a  value
                                          from 17 to 128 to use planar  inter-
                                          polation.  Increasing values from 17
                                          to 128 result in  increasing  reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value 128  results  in  the  softest

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep  the default value, Enabled, to
                                          adjust  quantization   within   each
                                          frame  based on spatial variation of
                                          content complexity. When you  enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex  textured blocks are encoded
                                          with fewer bits and smooth  textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the
                                          viewer's attention is likely to  be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing

                                          create   a  smoother  picture.  Hard
                                          telecine produces a  29.97i  output.
                                          Soft  telecine  produces  an  output
                                          with a 23.976 output that signals to
                                          the  video  player  device to do the
                                          conversion during  play  back.  When

                                      CodecProfile -> (string)
                                          Use  Profile  to specify the type of
                                          Apple ProRes codec to use  for  this

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing  the  frame rate. For nu-
                                          merically simple  conversions,  such
                                          as  60  fps  to 30 fps: We recommend
                                          that you  keep  the  default  value,
                                          Drop duplicate. For numerically com-
                                          plex conversions, to avoid  stutter:
                                          Choose  Interpolate. This results in
                                          a smooth picture, but  might  intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For complex frame rate  conversions,
                                          especially  if your source video has
                                          already  been  converted  from   its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to do motion-compensated  interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version method frame by frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant   add-on   cost.  When  you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  to  create  a  progressive
                                          output, regardless of the scan  type
                                          of  your  input. Use Top field first
                                          or Bottom field first to  create  an
                                          output  that's  interlaced  with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,  default  top or Follow, de-
                                          fault bottom to produce outputs with
                                          the   same  field  polarity  as  the
                                          source. For jobs that have  multiple
                                          inputs,  the  output  field polarity
                                          might change over the course of  the
                                          output.  Follow  behavior depends on
                                          the input scan type. If  the  source
                                          is  interlaced,  the  output will be
                                          interlaced with the same polarity as
                                          the  source.  If  the source is pro-
                                          gressive, the output will be  inter-
                                          laced  with  top  field bottom field
                                          first, depending  on  which  of  the
                                          Follow options you choose.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior, Follow  source,  uses  the
                                          PAR  from  your input video for your
                                          output. To specify a different  PAR,
                                          choose  any  value other than Follow
                                          source. When  you  choose  SPECIFIED
                                          for  this  setting,  you  must  also
                                          specify values for the  parNumerator
                                          and parDenominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio to SPECIFIED. On the  console,
                                          this  corresponds to any value other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                          that is different  from  your  input
                                          video  PAR,  provide your output PAR
                                          as a ratio. For example,  for  D1/DV
                                          NTSC  widescreen,  you would specify
                                          the ratio 40:33.  In  this  example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio to SPECIFIED. On the  console,
                                          this  corresponds to any value other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                          that is different  from  your  input
                                          video  PAR,  provide your output PAR
                                          as a ratio. For example,  for  D1/DV
                                          NTSC  widescreen,  you would specify
                                          the ratio 40:33.  In  this  example,
                                          the value for parNumerator is 40.

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-

                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                          Choose Interpolate. This results  in

                                          especially if your source video  has
                                          already   been  converted  from  its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer

                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for

                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for

                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing  the  frame rate. For nu-
                                          merically simple  conversions,  such
                                          as  60  fps  to 30 fps: We recommend
                                          that you  keep  the  default  value,
                                          Drop duplicate. For numerically com-
                                          plex conversions, to avoid  stutter:
                                          Choose  Interpolate. This results in
                                          a smooth picture, but  might  intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For complex frame rate  conversions,
                                          especially  if your source video has
                                          already  been  converted  from   its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to do motion-compensated  interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version method frame by frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant   add-on   cost.  When  you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP  Length  (keyframe  interval) in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer
                                          model)  in  bits. For example, enter
                                          five megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore this setting unless  you  set
                                          qualityTuningLevel   to  MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional. Specify  the  maximum  bi-
                                          trate  in  bits/second. For example,
                                          enter five megabits  per  second  as
                                          5000000.  The  default behavior uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior, Follow  source,  uses  the
                                          PAR  from  your input video for your
                                          output. To specify a  different  PAR
                                          in  the  console,  choose  any value
                                          other than Follow source.  When  you
                                          choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting,
                                          you must also specify values for the
                                          parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                                          tings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                          that  is  different  from your input
                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parNumerator is 40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          to  choose how you want to trade off
                                          encoding  speed  for  output   video
                                          quality.  The  default  behavior  is
                                          faster,  lower  quality,  multi-pass
                                          encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP8 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required when you set Codec to the value
                                      VP9.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target bitrate in  bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify  your  frame rate as a frac-
                                          tion.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose the method that you want  Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate.  For  nu-
                                          merically  simple  conversions, such
                                          as 60 fps to 30  fps:  We  recommend
                                          that  you  keep  the  default value,
                                          Drop duplicate. For numerically com-
                                          plex  conversions, to avoid stutter:
                                          Choose Interpolate. This results  in
                                          a  smooth  picture, but might intro-
                                          duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.
                                          For  complex frame rate conversions,
                                          especially if your source video  has
                                          already   been  converted  from  its
                                          original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                                          to  do motion-compensated interpola-
                                          tion. FrameFormer uses the best con-
                                          version  method frame by frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant  add-on  cost.   When   you
                                          choose FrameFormer, your input video
                                          resolution must be at least 128x96.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.  Specify  the  maximum bi-
                                          trate in bits/second.  For  example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          for this output. The default  behav-
                                          ior  is to use the same pixel aspect
                                          ratio as your input video.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  to SPECIFIED. On the console,
                                          this corresponds to any value  other
                                          than Follow source. When you specify
                                          an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)

                                          video PAR, provide your  output  PAR
                                          as  a  ratio. For example, for D1/DV
                                          NTSC widescreen, you  would  specify
                                          the  ratio  40:33.  In this example,
                                          the value for parDenominator is 33.

                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-

                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-

                                          decimal  number  for  Frame rate. In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for

                                          The  best  way  to  set  up adaptive
                                          quantization is to keep the  default

                                          feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                                          on  areas  of  the frame that aren't
                                          moving and uses more bits on complex

                                   output. If you don't specify a  value,  the
                                   service sets this to Insert by default.

                               Crop -> (structure)
                                   Use Cropping selection to specify the video
                                   area that the service will include  in  the
                                   output video frame.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Width of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   X -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the left edge of the video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                                   Y -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the top edge of the  video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                                   Applies  only  to  29.97  fps outputs. When
                                   this feature is enabled, the  service  will
                                   use  drop-frame  timecode on outputs. If it
                                   is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                                   the    system    will    fall    back    to
                                   non-drop-frame. This setting is enabled  by
                                   default when Timecode insertion is enabled.

                               FixedAfd -> (integer)
                                   Applies  only  if  you set AFD Signaling to
                                   Fixed. Use Fixed to specify a four-bit  AFD
                                   value  which  the service will write on all
                                   frames of this video output.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Use Height to define the  video  resolution
                                   height,  in pixels, for this output. To use
                                   the same resolution as  your  input:  Leave
                                   both  Width  and  Height  blank.  To evenly
                                   scale from  your  input  resolution:  Leave
                                   Height  blank  and enter a value for Width.
                                   For example, if your input is 1920x1080 and
                                   you  set Width to 1280, your output will be
                                   1280x720.

                               Position -> (structure)
                                   Use Selection placement to define the video
                                   area in your output frame. The area outside
                                   of the rectangle that you specify  here  is
                                   black.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Width of rectangle  in  pixels.  Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                                   X -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the left edge of the video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                                   Y -> (integer)
                                      The  distance,  in  pixels,  between the
                                      rectangle and the top edge of the  video
                                      frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               RespondToAfd -> (string)
                                   Use  Respond to AFD to specify how the ser-
                                   vice changes the video itself  in  response
                                   to  AFD  values  in the input. * Choose Re-

                                   Choose None to remove all input AFD  values
                                   from this output.

                               ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                                   Specify  how  the  service  handles outputs
                                   that have a different aspect ratio from the
                                   input  aspect ratio. Choose Stretch to out-

                                   stead.  This  setting  overrides  any value
                                   that you specify for the setting  Selection

                               Sharpness -> (integer)
                                   Use   Sharpness   setting  to  specify  the
                                   strength  of  anti-aliasing.  This  setting
                                   changes  the width of the anti-alias filter
                                   kernel used for scaling. Sharpness only ap-
                                   plies  if your output resolution is differ-
                                   ent from your input resolution.  0  is  the
                                   softest  setting,  100 the sharpest, and 50
                                   recommended for most content.

                               TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                                   Applies only to H.264,  H.265,  MPEG2,  and
                                   ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode inser-
                                   tion when the input frame rate is identical
                                   to  the output frame rate. To include time-
                                   codes in this output, set  Timecode  inser-
                                   tion  to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out,
                                   set it to DISABLED.  Default  is  DISABLED.
                                   When  the  service  inserts timecodes in an
                                   output, by default, it  uses  any  embedded
                                   timecodes  from  the  input.  If  none  are
                                   present, the service will set the  timecode
                                   for  the  first  output  frame  to zero. To
                                   change this default  behavior,  adjust  the
                                   settings  under  Timecode configuration. In
                                   the console, these settings are located un-

                                             Post temporal sharpening to apply
                                             sharpening  to  the edges of your
                                             output. Note that  Post  temporal
                                             sharpening  will  also  make  the

                                             fault behavior, Auto, allows  the
                                             transcoder  to  determine whether
                                             to apply sharpening, depending on
                                             your input type and quality. When
                                             you set Post temporal  sharpening
                                             to   Enabled,  specify  how  much

                                             strength  to define the amount of
                                             sharpening the transcoder applies
                                             to your output. Set Post temporal

                                             Medium,  or  High to indicate the

                                          Speed -> (integer)
                                             The speed of the  filter  (higher
                                             number  is  faster).  Low setting
                                             reduces bit rate at the  cost  of
                                             transcode  time, high setting im-
                                             proves transcode time at the cost
                                             of bit rate.

                                          Strength -> (integer)

                                   TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                      Settings for burning the output timecode
                                      and specified prefix into the output.

                                      FontSize -> (integer)
                                          Use  Font  size to set the font size
                                          of  any  burned-in  timecode.  Valid
                                          values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          Use  Position under Timecode burn-in
                                          to   specify   the   location    the
                                          burned-in timecode on output video.

                                      Prefix -> (string)
                                          Use Prefix to place ASCII characters
                                          before any burned-in  timecode.  For
                                          example,  a prefix of "EZ-" will re-
                                          sult      in      the       timecode
                                          "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the
                                          characters themselves or  the  ASCII
                                          code   equivalents.   The  supported
                                          range of characters is 0x20  through
                                          0x7e.  This  includes  letters, num-
                                          bers,  and  all  special  characters
                                          represented  on  a  standard English
                                          keyboard.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Use Width to define  the  video  resolution
                                   width,  in  pixels, for this output. To use
                                   the same resolution as  your  input:  Leave
                                   both  Width  and  Height  blank.  To evenly
                                   scale from  your  input  resolution:  Leave
                                   Width  blank  and enter a value for Height.
                                   For example, if your input is 1920x1080 and
                                   you  set Height to 720, your output will be
                                   1280x720.

              TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                 These settings control  how  the  service  handles  timecodes
                 throughout  the  job. These settings don't affect input clip-
                 ping.

                 Anchor -> (string)
                     If you use an editing platform that relies on  an  anchor
                     timecode,  use Anchor Timecode to specify a timecode that
                     will match the input video  frame  to  the  output  video
                     frame.    Use   24-hour   format   with   frame   number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores
                     frame  rate  conversion. System behavior for Anchor Time-
                     code varies depending on your setting for  Source.  *  If
                     Source  is  set to Specified Start, the first input frame
                     is the specified value in Start Timecode. Anchor Timecode
                     and  Start Timecode are used calculate output timecode. *
                     If Source is set  to  Start  at  0  the  first  frame  is
                     00:00:00:00.  *  If  Source is set to Embedded, the first
                     frame is the timecode value on the first input  frame  of
                     the input.

                 Source -> (string)
                     Use  Source  to set how timecodes are handled within this
                     job. To make sure that your video, audio,  captions,  and
                     markers  are  synchronized  and that time-based features,
                     such as image inserter, work correctly, choose the  Time-
                     code  source  option  that matches your assets. All time-
                     codes  are  in  a  24-hour  format  with   frame   number
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF).  *  Embedded - Use the timecode that is in
                     the input video.  If  no  embedded  timecode  is  in  the
                     source,  the service will use Start at 0 instead. * Start
                     at  0  -  Set  the  timecode  of  the  initial  frame  to
                     00:00:00:00.  * Specified Start - Set the timecode of the
                     initial frame to a value other than zero. You  use  Start
                     timecode to provide this value.

                 Start -> (string)
                     Only  use  when  you  set  Source to Specified start. Use
                     Start timecode to specify the timecode  for  the  initial
                     frame.    Use   24-hour   format   with   frame   number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF) or (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                 TimestampOffset -> (string)
                     Only applies to outputs  that  support  program-date-time
                     stamp.  Use  Timestamp  offset  to overwrite the timecode
                     date without affecting the time and frame number. Provide
                     the  new  date as a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". To
                     use Timestamp offset, you must also  enable  Insert  pro-
                     gram-date-time  in  the  output settings. For example, if
                     the date part of your timecodes is 2002-1-25 and you want
                     to  change  it to one year later, set Timestamp offset to
                     2003-1-25.

              TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                 Insert user-defined custom ID3 metadata at timecodes that you
                 specify.  In  each output that you want to include this meta-
                 data, you must set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                 Id3Insertions -> (list)
                     Id3Insertions contains  the  array  of  Id3Insertion  in-
                     stances.

                     (structure)
                        To insert ID3 tags in your output, specify two values.
                        Use ID3 tag to specify the base 64 encoded string  and
                        use  Timecode  to specify the time when the tag should
                        be inserted. To insert multiple ID3 tags in your  out-
                        put, create multiple instances of ID3 insertion.

                        Id3 -> (string)
                            Use  ID3  tag to provide a fully formed ID3 tag in
                            base64-encode format.

                        Timecode -> (string)
                            Provide a Timecode in HH:MM:SS:FF  or  HH:MM:SS;FF
                            format.

          SimulateReservedQueue -> (string)
              Enable this setting when you run a test job to estimate how many
              reserved transcoding slots (RTS) you need. When this is enabled,
              MediaConvert  runs your job from an on-demand queue with similar
              performance to what you will see with  one  RTS  in  a  reserved
              queue. This setting is disabled by default.

          Status -> (string)
              A  job's  status  can  be SUBMITTED, PROGRESSING, COMPLETE, CAN-
              CELED, or ERROR.

          StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
