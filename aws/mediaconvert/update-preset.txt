OPTIONS
       --category  (string) The new category for the preset, if you are chang-
       ing it.

       --description (string) The new description for the preset, if  you  are
       changing it.

       --name (string) The name of the preset you are modifying.

       --settings (structure) Settings for presetAudioDescriptions -> (list)
              Contains  groups  of  audio encoding settings organized by audio
              codec. Include one instance of per output. Can contain  multiple
              groups of encoding settings.

              (structure)
                 Settings  related  to  one audio tab on the MediaConvert con-
                 sole. In your job JSON, an instance  of  AudioDescription  is
                 equivalent  to one audio tab in the console. Usually, one au-
                 dio tab corresponds to one output audio track.  Depending  on
                 how you set up your input audio selectors and whether you use
                 audio selector groups, one audio  tab  can  correspond  to  a
                 group of output audio tracks.

                 AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                     Specify  the  QuickTime audio channel layout tags for the
                     audio channels in this audio track. When you don't  spec-
                     ify a value, MediaConvert labels your track as Center (C)
                     by default. To use Audio layout tagging, your output must
                     be  in  a  QuickTime (MOV) container and your audio codec
                     must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF.

                     ChannelTag -> (string)
                        Specify the QuickTime audio channel  layout  tags  for
                        the  audio channels in this audio track. Enter channel
                        layout tags in the same order as your  output's  audio
                        channel order. For example, if your output audio track
                        has a left and a right channel, enter Left (L) for the
                        first  channel  and  Right (R) for the second. If your
                        output has multiple single-channel audio tracks, enter
                        a single channel layout tag for each track.

                     ChannelTags -> (list)
                        Specify  the  QuickTime  audio channel layout tags for
                        the audio channels in this audio track. Enter  channel
                        layout  tags  in the same order as your output's audio
                        channel order. For example, if your output audio track
                        has a left and a right channel, enter Left (L) for the
                        first channel and Right (R) for the  second.  If  your
                        output has multiple single-channel audio tracks, enter
                        a single channel layout tag for each track.

                        (string)
                            Specify the QuickTime audio  channel  layout  tags
                            for  the audio channels in this audio track. Enter
                            channel layout tags in the same order as your out-
                            put's  audio  channel  order. For example, if your
                            output audio track has a left and a right channel,
                            enter Left (L) for the first channel and Right (R)
                            for the second. If your output has  multiple  sin-
                            gle-channel  audio  tracks, enter a single channel
                            layout tag for each track.

                 AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                     Advanced audio normalization settings. Ignore these  set-
                     tings unless you need to comply with a loudness standard.

                     Algorithm -> (string)
                        Choose  one of the following audio normalization algo-
                        rithms: ITU-R BS.1770-1: Ungated loudness. A  measure-
                        ment  of  ungated average loudness for an entire piece
                        of content, suitable  for  measurement  of  short-form
                        content under ATSC recommendation A/85. Supports up to
                        5.1 audio channels. ITU-R BS.1770-2: Gated loudness. A
                        measurement  of  gated average loudness compliant with
                        the requirements of EBU-R128. Supports up to 5.1 audio
                        channels.  ITU-R  BS.1770-3:  Modified  peak. The same
                        loudness measurement algorithm as 1770-2, with an  up-
                        dated  true  peak measurement. ITU-R BS.1770-4: Higher
                        channel count. Allows for more audio channels than the
                        other  algorithms,  including  configurations  such as
                        7.1.

                     AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                        When enabled the output audio is corrected  using  the
                        chosen  algorithm. If disabled, the audio will be mea-
                        sured but not adjusted.

                     CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                        Content measuring above this level will  be  corrected
                        to  the  target  level.  Content  measuring below this
                        level will not be corrected.

                     LoudnessLogging -> (string)
                        If set to LOG, log each output's audio track  loudness
                        to a CSV file.

                     PeakCalculation -> (string)
                        If  set  to  TRUE_PEAK, calculate and log the TruePeak
                        for each output's audio track loudness.

                     TargetLkfs -> (double)
                        When you use Audio normalization, optionally use  this
                        setting  to  specify  a  target loudness. If you don't
                        specify a value here, the encoder chooses a value  for
                        you,  based on the algorithm that you choose for Algo-
                        rithm. If you choose  algorithm  1770-1,  the  encoder
                        will  choose  -24  LKFS;  otherwise,  the encoder will
                        choose -23 LKFS.

                     TruePeakLimiterThreshold -> (double)
                        Specify the True-peak limiter  threshold  in  decibels
                        relative  to  full  scale (dBFS). The peak inter-audio
                        sample loudness in your output will be limited to  the
                        value  that you specify, without affecting the overall
                        target LKFS. Enter a value from 0 to -8.  Leave  blank
                        to use the default value 0.

                 AudioSourceName -> (string)
                     Specifies which audio data to use from each input. In the
                     simplest case, specify  an  "Audio  Selector":#inputs-au-
                     dio_selector  by  name based on its order within each in-
                     put. For example if you specify "Audio Selector 3",  then
                     the third audio selector will be used from each input. If
                     an input does not have an "Audio Selector  3",  then  the
                     audio  selector marked as "default" in that input will be
                     used. If there is no audio selector marked as  "default",
                     silence  will be inserted for the duration of that input.
                     Alternatively,  an  "Audio  Selector   Group":#inputs-au-
                     dio_selector_group  name  may  be specified, with similar
                     default/silence  behavior.  If  no  audio_source_name  is
                     specified,  then  "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen auto-
                     matically.

                 AudioType -> (integer)
                     Applies only if Follow  Input  Audio  Type  is  unchecked
                     (false).  A  number  between 0 and 255. The following are
                     defined in ISO-IEC 13818-1: 0 = Undefined, 1 = Clean  Ef-
                     fects,  2  = Hearing Impaired, 3 = Visually Impaired Com-
                     mentary, 4-255 = Reserved.

                 AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                     When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input  contains  an  ISO
                     639  audio_type, then that value is passed through to the
                     output. If the input contains no ISO 639 audio_type,  the
                     value  in Audio Type is included in the output. Otherwise
                     the value in Audio Type is included in the  output.  Note
                     that  this  field  and  audioType are both ignored if au-
                     dioDescriptionBroadcasterMix    is    set    to    BROAD-
                     CASTER_MIXED_AD.

                 CodecSettings -> (structure)
                     Settings  related to audio encoding. The settings in this
                     group vary depending on the value  that  you  choose  for
                     your audio codec.

                     AacSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value AAC. The ser-
                        vice accepts one of two mutually exclusive  groups  of
                        AAC  settings--VBR  and  CBR.  To  select one of these
                        modes, set the value of Bitrate control mode to  "VBR"
                        or  "CBR".  In VBR mode, you control the audio quality
                        with the setting VBR quality. In CBR mode, you use the
                        setting  Bitrate.  Defaults and valid values depend on
                        the rate control mode.

                        AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)
                            Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when  the  input  con-
                            tains  pre-mixed  main  audio  + audio description
                            (AD) as a stereo pair.  The  value  for  AudioType
                            will be set to 3, which signals to downstream sys-
                            tems that this stream contains "broadcaster  mixed
                            AD".  Note  that the input received by the encoder
                            must contain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does not
                            perform   the   mixing.  When  you  choose  BROAD-
                            CASTER_MIXED_AD, the encoder  ignores  any  values
                            you provide in AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.
                            Choose NORMAL when  the  input  does  not  contain
                            pre-mixed  audio + audio description (AD). In this
                            case, the encoder will use any values you  provide
                            for AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  average  bitrate in bits per second.
                            The set of valid values for this setting is: 6000,
                            8000,  10000,  12000,  14000, 16000, 20000, 24000,
                            28000, 32000, 40000, 48000, 56000,  64000,  80000,
                            96000,  112000,  128000,  160000,  192000, 224000,
                            256000, 288000, 320000,  384000,  448000,  512000,
                            576000, 640000, 768000, 896000, 1024000. The value
                            you set is also constrained by the values that you
                            choose for Profile, Bitrate control mode, and Sam-
                            ple rate. Default values depend on Bitrate control
                            mode and Profile.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            AAC Profile.

                        CodingMode -> (string)
                            The  Coding  mode  that you specify determines the
                            number of audio channels  and  the  audio  channel
                            layout  metadata  in your AAC output. Valid coding
                            modes depend on the Rate control mode and  Profile
                            that you select. The following list shows the num-
                            ber of audio channels and channel layout for  each
                            coding  mode.  *  1.0  Audio Description (Receiver
                            Mix): One channel, C. Includes  audio  description
                            data  from your stereo input. For more information
                            see ETSI TS 101 154 Annex E. * 1.0 Mono: One chan-
                            nel,  C.  *  2.0 Stereo: Two channels, L, R. * 5.1

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Rate Control Mode.

                        RawFormat -> (string)
                            Enables LATM/LOAS AAC output. Note that if you use
                            LATM/LOAS  AAC  in  an output, you must choose "No
                            container" for the output container.

                        SampleRate -> (integer)
                            Specify the Sample rate in Hz. Valid sample  rates
                            depend on the Profile and Coding mode that you se-
                            lect. The following list shows valid sample  rates
                            for  each  Profile  and Coding mode. * LC Profile,
                            Coding mode 1.0,  2.0,  and  Receiver  Mix:  8000,

                            recommend that you use the mode-specific  settings
                            instead  of Dynamic range compression profile. The
                            mode-specific settings are Dynamic range  compres-
                            sion profile, line mode and Dynamic range compres-
                            sion profile, RF mode. Note that when you  specify
                            values  for  all  three settings, MediaConvert ig-
                            nores the value of this setting in  favor  of  the
                            mode-specific settings. If you do use this setting
                            instead of the mode-specific settings, choose None
                            to  leave out DRC signaling. Keep the default Film
                            standard to set the profile to Dolby's film  stan-

                            32000 through 192000. The default value is  96000,
                            which we recommend for quality and bandwidth.

                        Channels -> (integer)
                            Specify  the number of channels in this output au-
                            dio track. Choosing Mono on  gives  you  1  output
                            channel;  choosing Stereo gives you 2. In the API,
                            valid values are 1 and 2.

                        SampleRate -> (integer)
                            Optional. Sample rate  in  Hz.  Valid  values  are
                            16000,  24000,  and  48000.  The  default value is

                            default value is 4 (~128 kbit/s). Values 5  and  6
                            are  approximately  160  and  192  kbit/s, respec-
                            tively.

                     WavSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value WAV.

                        BitDepth -> (integer)
                            Specify Bit depth, in bits per sample,  to  choose
                            the encoding quality for this audio track.

                        Channels -> (integer)
                            Specify  the number of channels in this output au-
                            dio track. Valid values are 1 and even numbers  up
                            to  64.  For example, 1, 2, 4, 6, and so on, up to
                            64.

                        Format -> (string)
                            The service defaults to using RIFF  for  WAV  out-
                            puts.  If  your output audio is likely to exceed 4
                            GB in file size, or if you otherwise need the  ex-
                            tended support of the RF64 format, set your output
                            WAV file format to RF64.

                        SampleRate -> (integer)
                            Sample rate in Hz.

                 CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                     Specify the language for this  audio  output  track.  The
                     service  puts  this  language code into your output audio
                     track when you set Language code control to  Use  config-
                     ured.  The  service  also uses your specified custom lan-
                     guage code when you set Language code control  to  Follow
                     input,  but  your  input  file doesn't specify a language
                     code. For all outputs, you can use an ISO  639-2  or  ISO
                     639-3  code.  For streaming outputs, you can also use any
                     other code in the full RFC-5646 specification.  Streaming
                     outputs are those that are in one of the following output
                     groups: CMAF, DASH ISO, Apple HLS,  or  Microsoft  Smooth
                     Streaming.

                 LanguageCode -> (string)
                     Indicates the language of the audio output track. The ISO
                     639 language specified in the 'Language Code'  drop  down
                     will be used when 'Follow Input Language Code' is not se-
                     lected or when 'Follow Input Language Code'  is  selected
                     but  there  is  no ISO 639 language code specified by the
                     input.

                 LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                     Specify which source for language code  takes  precedence
                     for  this  audio track. When you choose Follow input, the
                     service uses the language code from the  input  track  if
                     it's  present.  If  there's  no languge code on the input
                     track, the service uses the code that you specify in  the
                     setting  Language  code.  When you choose Use configured,
                     the service uses the language code that you specify.

                 RemixSettings -> (structure)
                     Advanced audio remixing settings.

                     ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                        Channel mapping contains the group of fields that hold
                        the  remixing  value  for each channel, in dB. Specify
                        remix values to indicate how much of the content  from
                        your input audio channel you want in your output audio
                        channels. Each instance of the  InputChannels  or  In-
                        putChannelsFineTune  array  specifies these values for
                        one output channel. Use one instance of this array for
                        each output channel. In the console, each array corre-
                        sponds to a column in the graphical depiction  of  the
                        mapping  matrix. The rows of the graphical matrix cor-
                        respond to input channels. Valid values are within the
                        range from -60 (mute) through 6. A setting of 0 passes
                        the input channel unchanged to the output channel  (no
                        attenuation  or  amplification).  Use InputChannels or
                        InputChannelsFineTune to specify  your  remix  values.
                        Don't use both.

                        OutputChannels -> (list)
                            In  your JSON job specification, include one child
                            of OutputChannels for each audio channel that  you
                            want in your output. Each child should contain one
                            instance of  InputChannels  or  InputChannelsFine-
                            Tune.

                            (structure)
                               OutputChannel mapping settings.

                               InputChannels -> (list)
                                   Use this setting to specify your remix val-
                                   ues when they are integers, such as -10, 0,
                                   or 4.

                                   (integer)

                               InputChannelsFineTune -> (list)
                                   Use this setting to specify your remix val-
                                   ues when they  have  a  decimal  component,
                                   such as -10.312, 0.08, or 4.9. MediaConvert
                                   rounds your remixing values to the  nearest
                                   thousandth.

                                   (double)

                     ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  number of audio channels from your input
                        that you want to use in your  output.  With  remixing,
                        you might combine or split the data in these channels,
                        so the number of channels in your final  output  might
                        be different. If you are doing both input channel map-
                        ping and output channel mapping, the number of  output
                        channels in your input mapping must be the same as the
                        number of input channels in your output mapping.

                     ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                        Specify the number of channels in  this  output  after
                        remixing.  Valid  values:  1, 2, 4, 6, 8... 64. (1 and
                        even numbers to 64.) If you are doing both input chan-
                        nel  mapping and output channel mapping, the number of
                        output channels in your input mapping must be the same
                        as  the  number  of input channels in your output map-
                        ping.

                 StreamName -> (string)
                     Specify a label for this output audio stream.  For  exam-
                     ple,  "English", "Director commentary", or "track_2". For
                     streaming outputs, MediaConvert passes  this  information
                     into   destination   manifests   for   display   on   the
                     end-viewer's player device. For outputs in  other  output
                     groups, the service ignores this setting.

          CaptionDescriptions -> (list)
              This object holds groups of settings related to captions for one
              output. For each output that has captions, include one  instance
              of CaptionDescriptions.

              (structure)
                 Caption Description for preset

                 CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                     Specify  the language for this captions output track. For
                     most captions output formats, the encoder puts this  lan-
                     guage  information  in  the  output captions metadata. If
                     your output captions format is DVB-Sub or  Burn  in,  the
                     encoder uses this language information when automatically
                     selecting the font  script  for  rendering  the  captions
                     text.  For  all  outputs, you can use an ISO 639-2 or ISO
                     639-3 code. For streaming outputs, you can also  use  any
                     other  code in the full RFC-5646 specification. Streaming
                     outputs are those that are in one of the following output
                     groups:  CMAF,  DASH  ISO, Apple HLS, or Microsoft Smooth
                     Streaming.

                 DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                     Settings related to one captions tab on the  MediaConvert
                     console.  Usually,  one  captions  tab corresponds to one
                     output captions track. Depending on your output  captions
                     format,  one tab might correspond to a set of output cap-
                     tions    tracks.    For     more     information,     see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/including-captions.html.

                     BurninDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                        Burn-in is a captions delivery method, rather  than  a
                        captions  format. Burn-in writes the captions directly
                        on your video frames, replacing pixels of  video  con-
                        tent with the captions. Set up burn-in captions in the
                        same output as your video. For more  information,  see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/burn-in-output-captions.html.

                        Alignment -> (string)
                            Specify the alignment of your captions. If no  ex-
                            plicit  x_position  is provided, setting alignment
                            to centered will placethe captions at  the  bottom
                            center  of  the  output. Similarly, setting a left
                            alignment willalign captions to the bottom left of
                            the output. If x and y positions are given in con-
                            junction with the alignment  parameter,  the  font
                            will  be justified (either left or centered) rela-
                            tive to those coordinates.

                        ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless  Style  passthrough  is
                            set  to  Enabled and Font color set to Black, Yel-
                            low, Red, Green, Blue,  or  Hex.  Use  Apply  font
                            color for additional font color controls. When you
                            choose White text only, or leave blank, your  font
                            color  setting  only applies to white text in your
                            input captions. For example, if  your  font  color
                            setting  is  Yellow,  and your input captions have
                            red and white text, your output captions will have
                            red  and  yellow  text.  When you choose ALL_TEXT,
                            your font color setting applies  to  all  of  your
                            output captions text.

                        BackgroundColor -> (string)
                            Specify the color of the rectangle behind the cap-
                            tions. Leave background color blank and set  Style
                            passthrough to enabled to use the background color
                            data from your input captions, if present.

                        BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify the opacity of the  background  rectangle.
                            Enter  a value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transpar-
                            ent and 255 is opaque. If Style passthrough is set
                            to  enabled, leave blank to pass through the back-
                            ground style information in your input captions to
                            your  output captions. If Style passthrough is set
                            to disabled, leave blank to use a value of  0  and
                            remove all backgrounds from your output captions.

                        FallbackFont -> (string)
                            Specify  the font that you want the service to use
                            for your burn in captions when your input captions
                            specify  a font that MediaConvert doesn't support.
                            When you set Fallback font to best match, or leave
                            blank,  MediaConvert  uses  a  supported font that
                            most closely matches the font that your input cap-
                            tions specify. When there are multiple unsupported
                            fonts in your input captions, MediaConvert matches
                            each  font  with  the  supported font that matches
                            best. When you  explicitly  choose  a  replacement
                            font,  MediaConvert  uses that font to replace all
                            unsupported fonts from your input.

                        FontColor -> (string)
                            Specify the color of the burned-in captions  text.
                            Leave  Font  color blank and set Style passthrough
                            to enabled to use the font color  data  from  your
                            input captions, if present.

                        FontOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify the opacity of the burned-in captions. 255
                            is opaque; 0 is transparent.

                        FontResolution -> (integer)
                            Specify the  Font  resolution  in  DPI  (dots  per
                            inch).

                        FontScript -> (string)
                            Set  Font  script  to Automatically determined, or
                            leave blank, to automatically determine  the  font
                            script  in  your input captions. Otherwise, set to
                            Simplified Chinese (HANS) or  Traditional  Chinese
                            (HANT)  if  your input font script uses Simplified
                            or Traditional Chinese.

                        FontSize -> (integer)
                            Specify the Font size in pixels. Must be  a  posi-
                            tive  integer. Set to 0, or leave blank, for auto-
                            matic font size.

                        HexFontColor -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your Font color is  set
                            to Hex. Enter either six or eight hexidecimal dig-
                            its, representing red, green, and blue,  with  two
                            optional  extra  digits  for  alpha. For example a
                            value of 1122AABB is a red value of 0x11, a  green
                            value  of 0x22, a blue value of 0xAA, and an alpha
                            value of 0xBB.

                        OutlineColor -> (string)
                            Specify font outline color.  Leave  Outline  color
                            blank  and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                            the font outline color data from your  input  cap-
                            tions, if present.

                        OutlineSize -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  Outline size of the caption text, in
                            pixels. Leave Outline size  blank  and  set  Style
                            passthrough  to  enabled  to  use the outline size
                            data from your input captions, if present.

                        ShadowColor -> (string)
                            Specify the color of the shadow cast by  the  cap-
                            tions.  Leave  Shadow  color  blank  and set Style
                            passthrough to enabled to  use  the  shadow  color
                            data from your input captions, if present.

                        ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  opacity of the shadow. Enter a value
                            from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent and  255  is
                            opaque.  If  Style  passthrough is set to Enabled,
                            leave Shadow opacity blank  to  pass  through  the
                            shadow style information in your input captions to
                            your output captions. If Style passthrough is  set
                            to  disabled,  leave blank to use a value of 0 and
                            remove all shadows from your output captions.

                        ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                            Specify the horizontal offset of the shadow, rela-
                            tive  to  the  captions  in  pixels. A value of -2
                            would result in a shadow offset 2  pixels  to  the
                            left.

                        ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                            Specify the vertical offset of the shadow relative
                            to the captions in pixels. A value of -2 would re-
                            sult  in  a shadow offset 2 pixels above the text.
                            Leave  Shadow  y-offset  blank   and   set   Style
                            passthrough  to enabled to use the shadow y-offset
                            data from your input captions, if present.

                        StylePassthrough -> (string)
                            Set Style passthrough to ENABLED to use the avail-
                            able  style,  color, and position information from
                            your input  captions.  MediaConvert  uses  default
                            settings for any missing style and position infor-
                            mation  in  your   input   captions.   Set   Style
                            passthrough to DISABLED, or leave blank, to ignore
                            the style and position information from your input
                            captions and use default settings: white text with
                            black outlining,  bottom-center  positioning,  and
                            automatic    sizing.   Whether   you   set   Style
                            passthrough to enabled or not, you can also choose
                            to  manually  override any of the individual style
                            and position settings.

                        TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                            Specify whether the text spacing in your  captions
                            is  set  by the captions grid, or varies depending
                            on letter width. Choose fixed grid to  conform  to
                            the  spacing  specified  in the captions file more
                            accurately. Choose proportional to make  the  text
                            easier to read for closed captions.

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  horizontal position of the captions,
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A  value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                            ing 10 pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                            explicit  x_position  is  provided, the horizontal
                            caption position will be determined by the  align-
                            ment parameter.

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  vertical  position  of the captions,
                            relative to the top of the  output  in  pixels.  A
                            value  of 10 would result in the captions starting
                            10 pixels from the top of the output.  If  no  ex-
                            plicit y_position is provided, the caption will be
                            positioned towards the bottom of the output.

                     DestinationType -> (string)
                        Specify the format for this set of  captions  on  this
                        output.   The   default  format  is  embedded  without
                        SCTE-20. Note that your choice of  video  output  con-
                        tainer  constrains your choice of output captions for-
                        mat.       For       more       information,       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html.
                        If you are using SCTE-20 and you  want  to  create  an
                        output  that  complies  with  the SCTE-43 spec, choose
                        SCTE-20 plus embedded. To create a non-compliant  out-
                        put where the embedded captions come first, choose Em-
                        bedded plus SCTE-20.

                     DvbSubDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to DVB-Sub captions. Set  up  DVB-Sub
                        captions  in  the  same output as your video. For more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/dvb-sub-output-captions.html.

                        Alignment -> (string)
                            Specify the alignment of your captions. If no  ex-
                            plicit  x_position  is provided, setting alignment
                            to centered will placethe captions at  the  bottom
                            center  of  the  output. Similarly, setting a left
                            alignment willalign captions to the bottom left of
                            the output. If x and y positions are given in con-
                            junction with the alignment  parameter,  the  font
                            will  be justified (either left or centered) rela-
                            tive to those coordinates. Within  your  job  set-
                            tings,  all of your DVB-Sub settings must be iden-
                            tical.

                        ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless  Style  Passthrough  is
                            set  to  Enabled and Font color set to Black, Yel-
                            low, Red, Green, Blue,  or  Hex.  Use  Apply  font
                            color for additional font color controls. When you
                            choose White text only, or leave blank, your  font
                            color  setting  only applies to white text in your
                            input captions. For example, if  your  font  color
                            setting  is  Yellow,  and your input captions have
                            red and white text, your output captions will have
                            red  and  yellow  text.  When you choose ALL_TEXT,
                            your font color setting applies  to  all  of  your
                            output captions text.

                        BackgroundColor -> (string)
                            Specify the color of the rectangle behind the cap-
                            tions. Leave background color blank and set  Style
                            passthrough to enabled to use the background color
                            data from your input captions, if present.

                        BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify the opacity of the  background  rectangle.
                            Enter  a value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transpar-
                            ent and 255 is opaque. If Style passthrough is set
                            to  enabled, leave blank to pass through the back-
                            ground style information in your input captions to
                            your  output captions. If Style passthrough is set
                            to disabled, leave blank to use a value of  0  and
                            remove  all backgrounds from your output captions.
                            Within your job settings, all of your DVB-Sub set-
                            tings must be identical.

                        DdsHandling -> (string)
                            Specify how MediaConvert handles the display defi-
                            nition segment (DDS). To exclude the DDS from this
                            set  of  captions:  Keep the default, None. To in-
                            clude the DDS: Choose Specified. When you do, also
                            specify the offset coordinates of the display win-
                            dow with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate. To
                            include  the  DDS,  but not include display window
                            data: Choose No display window. When you  do,  you
                            can  write  position metadata to the page composi-
                            tion segment (PCS) with DDS x-coordinate  and  DDS
                            y-coordinate.  For video resolutions with a height
                            of 576 pixels or less,  MediaConvert  doesn't  in-
                            clude  the DDS, regardless of the value you choose
                            for DDS handling. All  burn-in  and  DVB-Sub  font
                            settings must match.

                        DdsXCoordinate -> (integer)
                            Use  this setting, along with DDS y-coordinate, to
                            specify the upper left corner of the display defi-
                            nition  segment  (DDS)  display  window. With this
                            setting, specify the distance, in pixels,  between
                            the  left  side  of the frame and the left side of
                            the DDS display window. Keep the default value, 0,
                            to  have  MediaConvert  automatically  choose this
                            offset. Related setting: When you  use  this  set-
                            ting,  you  must set DDS handling to a value other
                            than None. MediaConvert uses these values  to  de-
                            termine whether to write page position data to the
                            DDS  or  to  the  page  composition  segment.  All
                            burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        DdsYCoordinate -> (integer)
                            Use  this setting, along with DDS x-coordinate, to
                            specify the upper left corner of the display defi-
                            nition  segment  (DDS)  display  window. With this
                            setting, specify the distance, in pixels,  between
                            the  top  of the frame and the top of the DDS dis-
                            play window. Keep the default value,  0,  to  have
                            MediaConvert automatically choose this offset. Re-
                            lated setting: When you use this setting, you must
                            set DDS handling to a value other than None. Medi-
                            aConvert uses these values to determine whether to
                            write page position data to the DDS or to the page
                            composition segment (PCS). All burn-in and DVB-Sub
                            font settings must match.

                        FallbackFont -> (string)
                            Specify  the font that you want the service to use
                            for your burn in captions when your input captions
                            specify  a font that MediaConvert doesn't support.
                            When you set Fallback font to best match, or leave
                            blank,  MediaConvert  uses  a  supported font that
                            most closely matches the font that your input cap-
                            tions specify. When there are multiple unsupported
                            fonts in your input captions, MediaConvert matches
                            each  font  with  the  supported font that matches
                            best. When you  explicitly  choose  a  replacement
                            font,  MediaConvert  uses that font to replace all
                            unsupported fonts from your input.

                        FontColor -> (string)
                            Specify the color of the captions text. Leave Font
                            color  blank  and set Style passthrough to enabled
                            to use the font color data from  your  input  cap-
                            tions,  if  present. Within your job settings, all
                            of your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        FontOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify the opacity of the burned-in captions. 255
                            is  opaque; 0 is transparent. Within your job set-
                            tings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must be  iden-
                            tical.

                        FontResolution -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  Font  resolution  in  DPI  (dots per
                            inch). Within  your  job  settings,  all  of  your
                            DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        FontScript -> (string)
                            Set  Font  script  to Automatically determined, or
                            leave blank, to automatically determine  the  font
                            script  in  your input captions. Otherwise, set to
                            Simplified Chinese (HANS) or  Traditional  Chinese
                            (HANT)  if  your input font script uses Simplified
                            or Traditional Chinese. Within your job  settings,
                            all of your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        FontSize -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  Font size in pixels. Must be a posi-
                            tive integer. Set to 0, or leave blank, for  auto-
                            matic  font size. Within your job settings, all of
                            your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Specify the height, in  pixels,  of  this  set  of
                            DVB-Sub captions. The default value is 576 pixels.
                            Related setting: When you use  this  setting,  you
                            must  set DDS handling to a value other than None.
                            All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        HexFontColor -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your Font color is  set
                            to Hex. Enter either six or eight hexidecimal dig-
                            its, representing red, green, and blue,  with  two
                            optional  extra  digits  for  alpha. For example a
                            value of 1122AABB is a red value of 0x11, a  green
                            value  of 0x22, a blue value of 0xAA, and an alpha
                            value of 0xBB.

                        OutlineColor -> (string)
                            Specify font outline color.  Leave  Outline  color
                            blank  and set Style passthrough to enabled to use
                            the font outline color data from your  input  cap-
                            tions,  if  present. Within your job settings, all
                            of your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        OutlineSize -> (integer)
                            Specify the Outline size of the caption  text,  in
                            pixels.  Leave  Outline  size  blank and set Style
                            passthrough to enabled to  use  the  outline  size
                            data  from your input captions, if present. Within
                            your job settings, all of  your  DVB-Sub  settings
                            must be identical.

                        ShadowColor -> (string)
                            Specify  the  color of the shadow cast by the cap-
                            tions. Leave Shadow  color  blank  and  set  Style
                            passthrough  to  enabled  to  use the shadow color
                            data from your input captions, if present.  Within
                            your  job  settings,  all of your DVB-Sub settings
                            must be identical.

                        ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                            Specify the opacity of the shadow. Enter  a  value
                            from  0  to 255, where 0 is transparent and 255 is
                            opaque. If Style passthrough is  set  to  Enabled,
                            leave  Shadow  opacity  blank  to pass through the
                            shadow style information in your input captions to
                            your  output captions. If Style passthrough is set
                            to disabled, leave blank to use a value of  0  and
                            remove  all  shadows  from  your  output captions.
                            Within your job settings, all of your DVB-Sub set-
                            tings must be identical.

                        ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                            Specify the horizontal offset of the shadow, rela-
                            tive to the captions in  pixels.  A  value  of  -2
                            would  result  in  a shadow offset 2 pixels to the
                            left.  Within  your  job  settings,  all  of  your
                            DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                            Specify the vertical offset of the shadow relative
                            to the captions in pixels. A value of -2 would re-
                            sult  in  a shadow offset 2 pixels above the text.
                            Leave  Shadow  y-offset  blank   and   set   Style
                            passthrough  to enabled to use the shadow y-offset
                            data from your input captions, if present.  Within
                            your  job  settings,  all of your DVB-Sub settings
                            must be identical.

                        StylePassthrough -> (string)
                            Set Style passthrough to ENABLED to use the avail-
                            able  style,  color, and position information from
                            your input  captions.  MediaConvert  uses  default
                            settings for any missing style and position infor-
                            mation  in  your   input   captions.   Set   Style
                            passthrough to DISABLED, or leave blank, to ignore
                            the style and position information from your input
                            captions and use default settings: white text with
                            black outlining,  bottom-center  positioning,  and
                            automatic    sizing.   Whether   you   set   Style
                            passthrough to enabled or not, you can also choose
                            to  manually  override any of the individual style
                            and position settings.

                        SubtitlingType -> (string)
                            Specify whether your DVB subtitles are standard or
                            for  hearing  impaired. Choose hearing impaired if
                            your subtitles include audio descriptions and dia-
                            logue.  Choose  standard if your subtitles include
                            only dialogue.

                        TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                            Specify whether the Text spacing in your  captions
                            is  set  by the captions grid, or varies depending
                            on letter width. Choose fixed grid to  conform  to
                            the  spacing  specified  in the captions file more
                            accurately. Choose proportional to make  the  text
                            easier  to  read  for closed captions. Within your
                            job settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must be
                            identical.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  width,  in  pixels,  of  this set of
                            DVB-Sub captions. The default value is 720 pixels.
                            Related  setting:  When  you use this setting, you
                            must set DDS handling to a value other than  None.
                            All burn-in and DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                        XPosition -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  horizontal position of the captions,
                            relative to the left side of the output in pixels.
                            A  value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                            ing 10 pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                            explicit  x_position  is  provided, the horizontal
                            caption position will be determined by the  align-
                            ment  parameter.  Within your job settings, all of
                            your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                        YPosition -> (integer)
                            Specify the vertical  position  of  the  captions,
                            relative  to  the  top  of the output in pixels. A

                            the  video are synchronized in the output. Specify
                            a frame rate that matches the frame  rate  of  the
                            associated  video.  If  the  video  frame  rate is
                            29.97, choose 29.97 dropframe only  if  the  video
                            has   video_insertion=true   and  drop_frame_time-
                            code=true; otherwise, choose 29.97 non-dropframe.

                            mation  in  your   input   captions.   Set   Style
                            passthrough to DISABLED, or leave blank, to ignore
                            the style and position information from your input
                            captions and use simplified output captions.

                            must  be a three-digit hexadecimal string; strings
                            ending in -FF are  invalid.  If  you  are  passing
                            through  the  entire  set of Teletext data, do not
                            use this field.

                            Specify the page types for this Teletext page.  If
                            you  don't  specify a value here, the service sets
                            the page type to the default  value  Subtitle.  If
                            you  pass through the entire set of Teletext data,
                            don't use this field. When you pass through a  set
                            of  Teletext  pages, your output has the same page

                        StylePassthrough -> (string)
                            To  use  the  available style, color, and position
                            information from your input  captions:  Set  Style
                            passthrough  to Enabled. MediaConvert uses default
                            settings when style and  position  information  is
                            missing  from your input captions. To recreate the
                            input captions exactly: Set Style  passthrough  to
                            Strict.  MediaConvert automatically applies timing
                            adjustments, including adjustments for frame  rate
                            conversion,  ad  avails,  and input clipping. Your
                            input captions format must be  WebVTT.  To  ignore
                            the style and position information from your input
                            captions and use simplified output  captions:  Set
                            Style passthrough to Disabled, or leave blank.

                 LanguageCode -> (string)
                     Specify  the  language of this captions output track. For
                     most captions output formats, the encoder puts this  lan-
                     guage  information  in  the  output captions metadata. If
                     your output captions format is DVB-Sub or  Burn  in,  the
                     encoder uses this language information to choose the font
                     language for rendering the captions text.

                 LanguageDescription -> (string)
                     Specify a label for this set of output captions. For  ex-
                     ample,  "English",  "Director  commentary", or "track_2".
                     For streaming outputs, MediaConvert passes this  informa-
                     tion  into  destination  manifests  for  display  on  the
                     end-viewer's player device. For outputs in  other  output
                     groups, the service ignores this setting.

          ContainerSettings -> (structure)
              Container specific settings.

              CmfcSettings -> (structure)
                 These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for the
                 segments in your CMAF outputs.

                 AudioDuration -> (string)
                     Specify this setting only when your output will  be  con-
                     sumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensi-
                     tive to very small duration differences between video and
                     audio.  For  this situation, choose Match video duration.
                     In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec
                     duration. When you choose Match video duration, MediaCon-
                     vert pads the output audio streams with silence or  trims
                     them  to  ensure  that  the  total duration of each audio
                     stream is at least as long as the total duration  of  the
                     video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream
                     duration is no more than one frame longer than the  video
                     stream.  MediaConvert  applies  audio padding or trimming
                     only to the end of the last segment of  the  output.  For
                     unsegmented  outputs,  MediaConvert  adds padding only to
                     the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                     minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will
                     depend on your output audio codec.

                 AudioGroupId -> (string)
                     Specify the audio rendition group for this  audio  rendi-
                     tion.  Specify  up  to one value for each audio output in
                     your output group. This value appears in your HLS  parent
                     manifest  in  the  EXT-X-MEDIA  tag of TYPE=AUDIO, as the
                     value for the GROUP-ID attribute.  For  example,  if  you
                     specify  "audio_aac_1"  for Audio group ID, it appears in
                     your   manifest    like    this:    #EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AU-
                     DIO,GROUP-ID="audio_aac_1". Related setting: To associate
                     the rendition group that this audio track belongs to with
                     a  video  rendition, include the same value that you pro-
                     vide here for that video output's setting Audio rendition
                     sets.

                 AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                     List  the  audio  rendition groups that you want included
                     with this video rendition. Use  a  comma-separated  list.
                     For  example, say you want to include the audio rendition
                     groups that have the audio group  IDs  "audio_aac_1"  and
                     "audio_dolby".  Then  you  would specify this value: "au-
                     dio_aac_1,audio_dolby". Related  setting:  The  rendition
                     groups  that  you  include  in  your comma-separated list
                     should all match values that you specify in  the  setting
                     Audio  group  ID  for audio renditions in the same output
                     group as this video rendition. Default behavior:  If  you
                     don't specify anything here and for Audio group ID, Medi-
                     aConvert puts each audio variant in its own audio  rendi-
                     tion  group  and  associates it with every video variant.
                     Each value in your list appears in your HLS parent  mani-
                     fest in the EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value for the AU-
                     DIO attribute. To continue the previous example, say that
                     the  file name for the child manifest for your video ren-
                     dition is "amazing_video_1.m3u8". Then,  in  your  parent
                     manifest,  each value will appear on separate lines, like
                     this:   #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_aac_1"...    amaz-
                     ing_video_1.m3u8 #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_dolby"...
                     amazing_video_1.m3u8

                 AudioTrackType -> (string)
                     Use this setting to control the values that  MediaConvert
                     puts  in  your  HLS  parent  playlist  to control how the
                     client player selects which audio track to  play.  Choose
                     Audio-only variant stream (AUDIO_ONLY_VARIANT_STREAM) for
                     any variant that you want to  prohibit  the  client  from
                     playing with video. This causes MediaConvert to represent
                     the variant as an EXT-X-STREAM-INF in the  HLS  manifest.
                     The  other  options for this setting determine the values
                     that MediaConvert writes for the DEFAULT  and  AUTOSELECT
                     attributes  of  the EXT-X-MEDIA entry for the audio vari-
                     ant. For more information about these attributes, see the
                     Apple                documentation                article
                     https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist.
                     Choose  Alternate  audio, auto select, default to set DE-
                     FAULT=YES and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this value for  only
                     one variant in your output group. Choose Alternate audio,
                     auto select, not default to set  DEFAULT=NO  and  AUTOSE-
                     LECT=YES.  Choose Alternate Audio, Not Auto Select to set
                     DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=NO. When you  don't  specify  a
                     value  for  this setting, MediaConvert defaults to Alter-
                     nate audio, auto select, default. When there is more than
                     one  variant  in  your  output group, you must explicitly
                     choose a value for this setting.

                 DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                     Specify whether to flag this audio track  as  descriptive
                     video service (DVS) in your HLS parent manifest. When you
                     choose Flag, MediaConvert includes the parameter  CHARAC-
                     TERISTICS="public.accessibility.describes-video"  in  the
                     EXT-X-MEDIA entry for this track. When you keep  the  de-
                     fault choice, Don't flag, MediaConvert leaves this param-
                     eter out. The DVS flag can help with accessibility on Ap-
                     ple devices. For more information, see the Apple documen-
                     tation.

                 IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                     Choose Include to have MediaConvert generate an HLS child
                     manifest that lists only the I-frames for this rendition,
                     in addition to your regular manifest for this  rendition.
                     You  might  use  this manifest as part of a workflow that
                     creates preview functions for  your  video.  MediaConvert
                     adds both the I-frame only child manifest and the regular
                     child manifest to the parent  manifest.  When  you  don't
                     need  the  I-frame  only child manifest, keep the default
                     value Exclude.

                 KlvMetadata -> (string)
                     To include key-length-value metadata in this output:  Set
                     KLV metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaConvert reads
                     KLV metadata present in your input and  writes  each  in-
                     stance to a separate event message box in the output, ac-
                     cording to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this  KLV  metadata:
                     Set KLV metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                 ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                     To  add  an  InbandEventStream element in your output MPD
                     manifest for each type of  event  message,  set  Manifest
                     metadata  signaling  to  Enabled. For ID3 event messages,
                     the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri  will  be  same
                     value  that  you  specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI.
                     For SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream  element
                     schemeIdUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave
                     these elements out of your output MPD manifest, set Mani-
                     fest  metadata  signaling to Disabled. To enable Manifest
                     metadata signaling, you must also set SCTE-35  source  to
                     Passthrough,  ESAM  SCTE-35 to insert, or ID3 metadata to
                     Passthrough.

                 Scte35Esam -> (string)
                     Use this setting only when you  specify  SCTE-35  markers
                     from  ESAM.  Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35 markers in this
                     output at the insertion points that  you  specify  in  an
                     ESAM  XML  document.  Provide the document in the setting
                     SCC XML.

                 Scte35Source -> (string)
                     Ignore this setting unless you have  SCTE-35  markers  in
                     your  input  video  file.  Choose Passthrough if you want
                     SCTE-35 markers that appear in your input to also  appear
                     in  this  output.  Choose  None  if  you don't want those
                     SCTE-35 markers in this output.

                 TimedMetadata -> (string)
                     To include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3  metadata
                     to  Passthrough.  Specify this ID3 metadata in Custom ID3
                     metadata inserter. MediaConvert writes each  instance  of
                     ID3  metadata  in a separate Event Message (eMSG) box. To
                     exclude this ID3 metadata: Set ID3 metadata  to  None  or
                     leave blank.

                 TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                     Specify  the  event  message  box  (eMSG) version for ID3
                     timed metadata in your output. For more information,  see
                     ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section  5.10.3.3.3  Syntax. Leave
                     blank to use the default value Version 0. When you  spec-
                     ify  Version  1,  you  must  also  set  ID3  metadata  to
                     Passthrough.

                 TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                     Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme  ID  URI  for
                     ID3  timed metadata in your output. For more information,
                     see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022  section  5.10.3.3.4  Semantics.
                     Leave     blank     to    use    the    default    value:
                     https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a value for
                     ID3  metadata  scheme ID URI, you must also set ID3 meta-
                     data to Passthrough.

                 TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                     Specify the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3  timed
                     metadata  in  your  output.  For  more  information,  see
                     ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4  Semantics.  When
                     you specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value, you must also
                     set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

              Container -> (string)
                 Container for this output. Some  containers  require  a  con-
                 tainer  settings object. If not specified, the default object
                 will be created.

              F4vSettings -> (structure)
                 Settings for F4v container

                 MoovPlacement -> (string)
                     To place the MOOV atom at the beginning of  your  output,
                     which  is useful for progressive downloading: Leave blank
                     or choose Progressive download. To place the MOOV at  the
                     end of your output: Choose Normal.

              M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                 MPEG-2  TS  container  settings.  These apply to outputs in a
                 File output group  when  the  output's  container  is  MPEG-2
                 Transport  Stream  (M2TS). In these assets, data is organized
                 by the program map table (PMT). Each transport stream program
                 contains  subsets  of data, including audio, video, and meta-
                 data. Each of these subsets of data  has  a  numerical  label
                 called  a packet identifier (PID). Each transport stream pro-
                 gram corresponds to one MediaConvert output.  The  PMT  lists
                 the  types  of  data in a program along with their PID. Down-
                 stream systems and players use the program map table to  look
                 up  the  PID  for each type of data it accesses and then uses
                 the PIDs to locate specific data within the asset.

                 AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                     Selects between the DVB and ATSC buffer models for  Dolby
                     Digital audio.

                 AudioDuration -> (string)
                     Specify  this  setting only when your output will be con-
                     sumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensi-
                     tive to very small duration differences between video and
                     audio. For this situation, choose Match  video  duration.
                     In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec
                     duration. When you choose Match video duration, MediaCon-
                     vert  pads the output audio streams with silence or trims
                     them to ensure that the  total  duration  of  each  audio
                     stream  is  at least as long as the total duration of the
                     video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream
                     duration  is no more than one frame longer than the video
                     stream. MediaConvert applies audio  padding  or  trimming
                     only  to  the  end of the last segment of the output. For
                     unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds  padding  only  to
                     the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                     minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will
                     depend on your output audio codec.

                 AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                     The number of audio frames to insert for each PES packet.

                 AudioPids -> (list)
                     Specify  the packet identifiers (PIDs) for any elementary
                     audio streams you include in this output. Specify  multi-
                     ple PIDs as a JSON array. Default is the range 482-492.

                     (integer)

                 Bitrate -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  output  bitrate  of the transport stream in
                     bits per second. Setting to 0 lets  the  muxer  automati-
                     cally  determine  the  appropriate  bitrate. Other common
                     values are 3750000, 7500000, and 15000000.

                 BufferModel -> (string)
                     Controls what buffer model to use for accurate interleav-
                     ing.  If set to MULTIPLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If
                     set to NONE, this can lead to lower latency, but low-mem-
                     ory devices may not be able to play back the stream with-
                     out interruptions.

                 DataPTSControl -> (string)
                     If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO,  MediaConvert  writes  cap-
                     tions  and data packets with Presentation Timestamp (PTS)
                     values greater than or equal to the  first  video  packet
                     PTS  (MediaConvert  drops  captions and data packets with
                     lesser PTS values). Keep the default value to  allow  all
                     PTS values.

                 DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                     Use  these  settings  to insert a DVB Network Information
                     Table (NIT) in the transport stream of this output.

                     NetworkId -> (integer)
                        The numeric value placed in  the  Network  Information
                        Table (NIT).

                     NetworkName -> (string)
                        The  network  name text placed in the network_name_de-
                        scriptor inside the Network Information Table. Maximum
                        length is 256 characters.

                     NitInterval -> (integer)
                        The  number  of milliseconds between instances of this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                 DvbSdtSettings -> (structure)
                     Use these settings to insert a  DVB  Service  Description
                     Table (SDT) in the transport stream of this output.

                     OutputSdt -> (string)
                        Selects  method of inserting SDT information into out-
                        put stream. "Follow input SDT" copies SDT  information
                        from  input stream to output stream. "Follow input SDT
                        if present" copies SDT information from  input  stream
                        to  output stream if SDT information is present in the
                        input, otherwise it will fall back on the user-defined
                        values. Enter "SDT Manually" means user will enter the
                        SDT information. "No SDT" means output stream will not
                        contain SDT information.

                     SdtInterval -> (integer)
                        The  number  of milliseconds between instances of this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     ServiceName -> (string)
                        The service name placed in the  service_descriptor  in
                        the  Service  Description Table. Maximum length is 256
                        characters.

                     ServiceProviderName -> (string)
                        The service provider name placed  in  the  service_de-
                        scriptor  in  the  Service  Description Table. Maximum
                        length is 256 characters.

                 DvbSubPids -> (list)
                     Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs)  for  DVB  subtitle
                     data  included in this output. Specify multiple PIDs as a
                     JSON array. Default is the range 460-479.

                     (integer)

                 DvbTdtSettings -> (structure)
                     Use these settings to insert a DVB Time  and  Date  Table
                     (TDT) in the transport stream of this output.

                     TdtInterval -> (integer)
                        The  number  of milliseconds between instances of this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                 DvbTeletextPid -> (integer)
                     Specify the packet identifier (PID) for DVB teletext data
                     you include in this output. Default is 499.

                 EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                     When  set to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS, audio EBP markers
                     will be added to partitions 3 and 4. The interval between
                     these  additional  markers  will  be  fixed,  and will be
                     slightly shorter than the video EBP marker interval. When
                     set  to VIDEO_INTERVAL, these additional markers will not
                     be inserted. Only applicable when EBP segmentation  mark-
                     ers  are  is  selected  (segmentationMarkers  is  EBP  or
                     EBP_LEGACY).

                 EbpPlacement -> (string)
                     Selects which PIDs to place EBP markers on. They can  ei-
                     ther  be  placed  only  on  the video PID, or on both the
                     video PID and all audio PIDs. Only  applicable  when  EBP
                     segmentation markers are is selected (segmentationMarkers
                     is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                 EsRateInPes -> (string)
                     Controls whether to include the ES Rate field in the  PES
                     header.

                 ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                     Keep  the  default  value unless you know that your audio
                     EBP markers are incorrectly appearing before  your  video
                     EBP  markers.  To correct this problem, set this value to
                     Force.

                 FragmentTime -> (double)
                     The length, in seconds, of each fragment. Only used  with
                     EBP markers.

                 KlvMetadata -> (string)
                     To  include key-length-value metadata in this output: Set
                     KLV metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaConvert reads
                     KLV  metadata present in your input and passes it through
                     to the output transport stream. To exclude this KLV meta-
                     data: Set KLV metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                 MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  maximum time, in milliseconds, between Pro-
                     gram Clock References (PCRs) inserted into the  transport
                     stream.

                 MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                     When  set,  enforces  that Encoder Boundary Points do not
                     come within the specified time interval of each other  by
                     looking  ahead at input video. If another EBP is going to
                     come in within the specified time interval,  the  current
                     EBP is not emitted, and the segment is "stretched" to the
                     next marker. The lookahead value does not add latency  to
                     the  system.  The Live Event must be configured elsewhere
                     to create sufficient latency to make the lookahead  accu-
                     rate.

                 NielsenId3 -> (string)
                     If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones for media tracking
                     will be detected in the input audio and an equivalent ID3
                     tag will be inserted in the output.

                 NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                     Value  in bits per second of extra null packets to insert
                     into the transport stream. This can be used  if  a  down-
                     stream encryption system requires periodic null packets.

                 PatInterval -> (integer)
                     The  number of milliseconds between instances of this ta-
                     ble in the output transport stream.

                 PcrControl -> (string)
                     When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program Clock  Refer-
                     ence  value  is  inserted for every Packetized Elementary
                     Stream (PES) header. This is effective only when the  PCR
                     PID is the same as the video or audio elementary stream.

                 PcrPid -> (integer)
                     Specify the packet identifier (PID) for the program clock
                     reference (PCR) in this output. If you do not  specify  a
                     value, the service will use the value for Video PID.

                 PmtInterval -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  number of milliseconds between instances of
                     the program map  table  (PMT)  in  the  output  transport
                     stream.

                 PmtPid -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) for the program map
                     table (PMT) itself. Default is 480.

                 PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                     Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the private  meta-
                     data stream. Default is 503.

                 ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                     Use  Program number to specify the program number used in
                     the program map table (PMT) for this output.  Default  is
                     1.  Program  numbers  and program map tables are parts of
                     MPEG-2 transport stream containers, used  for  organizing
                     data.

                 PtsOffset -> (integer)
                     Manually specify the initial PTS offset, in seconds, when
                     you set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter an integer from 0 to
                     3600. Leave blank to keep the default value 2.

                 PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                     Specify  the  initial presentation timestamp (PTS) offset
                     for your transport stream output. To let MediaConvert au-
                     tomatically  determine  the  initial PTS offset: Keep the
                     default value, Auto. We recommend that  you  choose  Auto
                     for the widest player compatibility. The initial PTS will
                     be at least two seconds and vary depending on  your  out-
                     put's  bitrate,  HRD  buffer  size and HRD buffer initial
                     fill percentage. To manually specify an initial PTS  off-
                     set:  Choose  Seconds. Then specify the number of seconds
                     with PTS offset.

                 RateMode -> (string)
                     When set to CBR,  inserts  null  packets  into  transport
                     stream  to  fill  specified bitrate. When set to VBR, the
                     bitrate setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but the out-
                     put will not be padded up to that bitrate.

                 Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                     Include  this in your job settings to put SCTE-35 markers
                     in your HLS and transport stream outputs at the insertion
                     points  that you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide
                     the document in the setting SCC XML.

                     Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream  in  the
                        transport stream generated by ESAM.

                 Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                     Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream
                     in the transport stream.

                 Scte35Source -> (string)
                     For SCTE-35 markers from your input-- Choose  Passthrough
                     if  you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in your input to
                     also appear in this output. Choose None if you don't want
                     SCTE-35  markers in this output. For SCTE-35 markers from
                     an ESAM XML document-- Choose None. Also provide the ESAM
                     XML  as a string in the setting Signal processing notifi-
                     cation XML. Also enable ESAM SCTE-35 (include  the  prop-
                     erty scte35Esam).

                 SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                     Inserts  segmentation  markers  at each segmentation_time
                     period. rai_segstart sets the Random Access Indicator bit
                     in  the  adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the RAI bit and
                     adds the current timecode  in  the  private  data  bytes.
                     psi_segstart  inserts  PAT and PMT tables at the start of
                     segments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point information  to
                     the  adaptation  field  as  per  OpenCable  specification
                     OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118. ebp_legacy  adds  Encoder  Boundary
                     Point  information to the adaptation field using a legacy
                     proprietary format.

                 SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                     The segmentation style parameter controls  how  segmenta-
                     tion markers are inserted into the transport stream. With
                     avails, it is possible that segments  may  be  truncated,
                     which can influence where future segmentation markers are
                     inserted. When a segmentation style of "reset_cadence" is
                     selected  and  a segment is truncated due to an avail, we
                     will reset the segmentation cadence. This means the  sub-
                     sequent  segment  will  have  a duration of of $segmenta-
                     tion_time seconds. When a segmentation  style  of  "main-
                     tain_cadence"  is selected and a segment is truncated due
                     to an avail, we will not reset the segmentation  cadence.
                     This  means  the  subsequent segment will likely be trun-
                     cated as well. However, all segments after that will have
                     a  duration  of $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP
                     lookahead is a slight exception to this rule.

                 SegmentationTime -> (double)
                     Specify the length, in seconds, of each segment. Required
                     unless markers is set to _none_.

                 TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream in the
                     transport stream.

                 TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                     Specify the ID for the transport  stream  itself  in  the
                     program  map  table for this output. Transport stream IDs
                     and program map tables  are  parts  of  MPEG-2  transport
                     stream containers, used for organizing data.

                 VideoPid -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  packet  identifier  (PID) of the elementary
                     video stream in the transport stream.

              M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                 These  settings  relate  to  the  MPEG-2   transport   stream
                 (MPEG2-TS)  container  for  the MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS
                 outputs.

                 AudioDuration -> (string)
                     Specify this setting only when your output will  be  con-
                     sumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensi-
                     tive to very small duration differences between video and
                     audio.  For  this situation, choose Match video duration.
                     In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec
                     duration. When you choose Match video duration, MediaCon-
                     vert pads the output audio streams with silence or  trims
                     them  to  ensure  that  the  total duration of each audio
                     stream is at least as long as the total duration  of  the
                     video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream
                     duration is no more than one frame longer than the  video
                     stream.  MediaConvert  applies  audio padding or trimming
                     only to the end of the last segment of  the  output.  For
                     unsegmented  outputs,  MediaConvert  adds padding only to
                     the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                     minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will
                     depend on your output audio codec.

                 AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                     The number of audio frames to insert for each PES packet.

                 AudioPids -> (list)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the elementary audio stream(s)
                     in  the  transport  stream. Multiple values are accepted,
                     and can be entered in ranges and/or by comma separation.

                     (integer)

                 DataPTSControl -> (string)
                     If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO,  MediaConvert  writes  cap-
                     tions  and data packets with Presentation Timestamp (PTS)
                     values greater than or equal to the  first  video  packet
                     PTS  (MediaConvert  drops  captions and data packets with
                     lesser PTS values). Keep the default value AUTO to  allow
                     all PTS values.

                 MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                     Specify  the  maximum time, in milliseconds, between Pro-
                     gram Clock References (PCRs) inserted into the  transport
                     stream.

                 NielsenId3 -> (string)
                     If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones for media tracking
                     will be detected in the input audio and an equivalent ID3
                     tag will be inserted in the output.

                 PatInterval -> (integer)
                     The  number of milliseconds between instances of this ta-
                     ble in the output transport stream.

                 PcrControl -> (string)
                     When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Program  Clock  Refer-
                     ence  value  is  inserted for every Packetized Elementary
                     Stream (PES) header. This  parameter  is  effective  only
                     when  the  PCR PID is the same as the video or audio ele-
                     mentary stream.

                 PcrPid -> (integer)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the  Program  Clock  Reference
                     (PCR)  in  the  transport stream. When no value is given,
                     the encoder will assign the same value as the Video PID.

                 PmtInterval -> (integer)
                     The number of milliseconds between instances of this  ta-
                     ble in the output transport stream.

                 PmtPid -> (integer)
                     Packet  Identifier  (PID) for the Program Map Table (PMT)
                     in the transport stream.

                 PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the private metadata stream in
                     the transport stream.

                 ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                     The  value of the program number field in the Program Map
                     Table.

                 PtsOffset -> (integer)
                     Manually specify the initial PTS offset, in seconds, when
                     you set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter an integer from 0 to
                     3600. Leave blank to keep the default value 2.

                 PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                     Specify the initial presentation timestamp  (PTS)  offset
                     for your transport stream output. To let MediaConvert au-
                     tomatically determine the initial PTS  offset:  Keep  the
                     default  value,  Auto.  We recommend that you choose Auto
                     for the widest player compatibility. The initial PTS will
                     be  at  least two seconds and vary depending on your out-
                     put's bitrate, HRD buffer size  and  HRD  buffer  initial
                     fill  percentage. To manually specify an initial PTS off-
                     set: Choose Seconds. Then specify the number  of  seconds
                     with PTS offset.

                 Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                     Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of  the  SCTE-35 stream in the
                     transport stream.

                 Scte35Source -> (string)
                     For SCTE-35 markers from your input-- Choose  Passthrough
                     if  you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in your input to
                     also appear in this output. Choose None if you don't want
                     SCTE-35  markers in this output. For SCTE-35 markers from
                     an ESAM XML document-- Choose None if you don't want man-
                     ifest  conditioning.  Choose  Passthrough  and  choose Ad
                     markers if you do want  manifest  conditioning.  In  both
                     cases,  also provide the ESAM XML as a string in the set-
                     ting Signal processing notification XML.

                 TimedMetadata -> (string)
                     Set ID3 metadata to Passthrough to include  ID3  metadata
                     in  this output. This includes ID3 metadata from the fol-
                     lowing features: ID3 timestamp  period,  and  Custom  ID3
                     metadata  inserter.  To exclude this ID3 metadata in this
                     output: set ID3 metadata to None or leave blank.

                 TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream in the
                     transport stream.

                 TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                     The value of the transport stream ID field in the Program
                     Map Table.

                 VideoPid -> (integer)
                     Packet Identifier (PID) of the elementary video stream in
                     the transport stream.

              MovSettings -> (structure)
                 These settings relate to your QuickTime MOV output container.

                 ClapAtom -> (string)
                     When  enabled, include 'clap' atom if appropriate for the
                     video output settings.

                 CslgAtom -> (string)
                     When enabled, file composition times will start at  zero,
                     composition times in the 'ctts' (composition time to sam-
                     ple) box for B-frames will  be  negative,  and  a  'cslg'
                     (composition  shift  least greatest) box will be included
                     per 14496-1 amendment 1. This improves compatibility with
                     Apple players and tools.

                 Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                     When  set  to  XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video streams into the
                     QuickTime file using XDCAM fourcc codes.  This  increases
                     compatibility with Apple editors and players, but may de-
                     crease compatibility with other players. Only  applicable
                     when the video codec is MPEG2.

                 PaddingControl -> (string)
                     Unless  you  need  Omneon compatibility: Keep the default
                     value, None. To make this output compatible with  Omneon:
                     Choose  Omneon.  When  you do, MediaConvert increases the
                     length of the 'elst' edit list atom. Note that this might
                     cause file rejections when a recipient of the output file
                     doesn't expect this extra padding.

                 Reference -> (string)
                     Always keep the default value (SELF_CONTAINED)  for  this
                     setting.

              Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                 These  settings  relate to your MP4 output container. You can
                 create audio only outputs with this container. For  more  in-
                 formation,                                                see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/supported-codecs-containers-audio-only.html#output-codecs-and-containers-supported-for-audio-only.

                 AudioDuration -> (string)
                     Specify  this  setting only when your output will be con-
                     sumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensi-
                     tive to very small duration differences between video and
                     audio. For this situation, choose Match  video  duration.
                     In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec
                     duration. When you choose Match video duration, MediaCon-
                     vert  pads the output audio streams with silence or trims
                     them to ensure that the  total  duration  of  each  audio
                     stream  is  at least as long as the total duration of the
                     video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream
                     duration  is no more than one frame longer than the video
                     stream. MediaConvert applies audio  padding  or  trimming
                     only  to  the  end of the last segment of the output. For
                     unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert adds  padding  only  to
                     the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                     minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will
                     depend on your output audio codec.

                 CslgAtom -> (string)
                     When  enabled, file composition times will start at zero,
                     composition times in the 'ctts' (composition time to sam-
                     ple)  box  for  B-frames  will  be negative, and a 'cslg'
                     (composition shift least greatest) box will  be  included
                     per 14496-1 amendment 1. This improves compatibility with
                     Apple players and tools.

                 CttsVersion -> (integer)
                     Ignore this setting unless compliance  to  the  CTTS  box
                     version specification matters in your workflow. Specify a
                     value of 1 to set your CTTS box version  to  1  and  make
                     your  output  compliant  with the specification. When you
                     specify a value of 1, you must also set CSLG atom to  the
                     value  INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0 to set your CTTS
                     box version to 0. This can provide backward compatibility
                     for some players and packagers.

                 FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                     Inserts a free-space box immediately after the moov box.

                 MoovPlacement -> (string)
                     To  place  the MOOV atom at the beginning of your output,
                     which is useful for progressive downloading: Leave  blank
                     or  choose Progressive download. To place the MOOV at the
                     end of your output: Choose Normal.

                 Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                     Overrides the "Major Brand" field  in  the  output  file.
                     Usually not necessary to specify.

              MpdSettings -> (structure)
                 These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for the
                 segments in your DASH outputs.

                 AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                     Optional. Choose Include to  have  MediaConvert  mark  up
                     your  DASH  manifest  with elements for embedded 608 cap-
                     tions. This markup isn't  generally  required,  but  some
                     video  players  require  it to discover and play embedded
                     608 captions. Keep the default value, Exclude,  to  leave
                     these elements out. When you enable this setting, this is
                     the markup that MediaConvert includes in your manifest:

                 AudioDuration -> (string)
                     Specify this setting only when your output will  be  con-
                     sumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that is sensi-
                     tive to very small duration differences between video and
                     audio.  For  this situation, choose Match video duration.
                     In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec
                     duration. When you choose Match video duration, MediaCon-
                     vert pads the output audio streams with silence or  trims
                     them  to  ensure  that  the  total duration of each audio
                     stream is at least as long as the total duration  of  the
                     video stream. After padding or trimming, the audio stream
                     duration is no more than one frame longer than the  video
                     stream.  MediaConvert  applies  audio padding or trimming
                     only to the end of the last segment of  the  output.  For
                     unsegmented  outputs,  MediaConvert  adds padding only to
                     the end of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                     minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will
                     depend on your output audio codec.

                 CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                     Use this setting only in DASH output groups that  include
                     sidecar  TTML  or IMSC captions. You specify sidecar cap-
                     tions in a separate output from  your  audio  and  video.
                     Choose  Raw  for  captions  in a single XML file in a raw
                     container. Choose Fragmented MPEG-4 for captions  in  XML
                     format contained within fragmented MP4 files. This set of
                     fragmented MP4 files is separate from your video and  au-
                     dio fragmented MP4 files.

                 KlvMetadata -> (string)
                     To  include key-length-value metadata in this output: Set
                     KLV metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaConvert reads
                     KLV  metadata  present  in your input and writes each in-
                     stance to a separate event message box in the output, ac-
                     cording  to  MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV metadata:
                     Set KLV metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                 ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                     To add an InbandEventStream element in  your  output  MPD
                     manifest  for  each  type  of event message, set Manifest
                     metadata signaling to Enabled. For  ID3  event  messages,
                     the  InbandEventStream  element  schemeIdUri will be same
                     value that you specify for ID3 metadata  scheme  ID  URI.
                     For  SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream element
                     schemeIdUri will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To  leave
                     these elements out of your output MPD manifest, set Mani-
                     fest metadata signaling to Disabled. To  enable  Manifest
                     metadata  signaling,  you must also set SCTE-35 source to
                     Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert, or ID3  metadata  to
                     Passthrough.

                 Scte35Esam -> (string)
                     Use  this  setting  only when you specify SCTE-35 markers
                     from ESAM. Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35 markers  in  this
                     output  at  the  insertion  points that you specify in an
                     ESAM XML document. Provide the document  in  the  setting
                     SCC XML.

                 Scte35Source -> (string)
                     Ignore  this  setting  unless you have SCTE-35 markers in
                     your input video file. Choose  Passthrough  if  you  want
                     SCTE-35  markers that appear in your input to also appear
                     in this output. Choose  None  if  you  don't  want  those
                     SCTE-35 markers in this output.

                 TimedMetadata -> (string)
                     To  include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 metadata
                     to Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata in  Custom  ID3
                     metadata  inserter.  MediaConvert writes each instance of
                     ID3 metadata in a separate Event Message (eMSG)  box.  To
                     exclude  this  ID3  metadata: Set ID3 metadata to None or
                     leave blank.

                 TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                     Specify the event message  box  (eMSG)  version  for  ID3
                     timed  metadata in your output. For more information, see
                     ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022  section  5.10.3.3.3  Syntax.  Leave
                     blank  to use the default value Version 0. When you spec-
                     ify  Version  1,  you  must  also  set  ID3  metadata  to
                     Passthrough.

                 TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                     Specify  the  event  message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI for
                     ID3 timed metadata in your output. For more  information,
                     see  ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics.
                     Leave    blank    to    use    the     default     value:
                     https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a value for
                     ID3 metadata scheme ID URI, you must also set  ID3  meta-
                     data to Passthrough.

                 TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                     Specify  the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3 timed
                     metadata  in  your  output.  For  more  information,  see
                     ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics. When
                     you specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value, you must also
                     set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

              MxfSettings -> (structure)
                 These settings relate to your MXF output container.

                 AfdSignaling -> (string)
                     Optional. When you have AFD signaling set up in your out-
                     put video stream, use this setting to choose  whether  to
                     also  include it in the MXF wrapper. Choose Don't copy to
                     exclude AFD signaling from the MXF wrapper.  Choose  Copy
                     from  video  stream to copy the AFD values from the video
                     stream for this output to the MXF wrapper. Regardless  of
                     which  option  you  choose,  the AFD values remain in the
                     video stream. Related settings: To set up your output  to
                     include  or  exclude  AFD values, see AfdSignaling, under
                     VideoDescription. On the console, find AFD signaling  un-
                     der the output's video encoding settings.

                 Profile -> (string)
                     Specify  the MXF profile, also called shim, for this out-
                     put. To automatically select a profile according to  your
                     output  video  codec  and  resolution, leave blank. For a
                     list of codecs  supported  with  each  MXF  profile,  see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/codecs-supported-with-each-mxf-profile.html.

                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/default-automatic-selection-of-mxf-profiles.html.

                 XavcProfileSettings -> (structure)
                     Specify  the  XAVC  profile settings for MXF outputs when
                     you set your MXF profile to XAVC.

                     DurationMode -> (string)
                        To create an output that complies with the  XAVC  file
                        format  guidelines  for interoperability, keep the de-
                        fault value, Drop frames for  compliance.  To  include
                        all  frames  from  your input in this output, keep the
                        default setting, Allow any  duration.  The  number  of
                        frames that MediaConvert excludes when you set this to
                        Drop frames for compliance depends on the output frame
                        rate and duration.

                     MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                        Specify a value for this setting only for outputs that
                        you set up with one of these two XAVC  profiles:  XAVC
                        HD  Intra CBG or XAVC 4K Intra CBG. Specify the amount
                        of space in each frame that the service  reserves  for
                        ancillary data, such as teletext captions. The default
                        value for this setting is 1492 bytes per  frame.  This
                        should  be  sufficient  to prevent overflow unless you
                        have multiple pages of teletext captions data. If  you
                        have a large amount of teletext data, specify a larger
                        number.

          VideoDescription -> (structure)
              VideoDescription contains a group of  video  encoding  settings.
              The  specific  video settings depend on the video codec that you
              choose for the property codec. Include one instance of  VideoDe-
              scription per output.

              AfdSignaling -> (string)
                 This setting only applies to H.264, H.265, and MPEG2 outputs.
                 Use Insert AFD signaling to specify whether the  service  in-
                 cludes  AFD  values  in  the output video data and what those
                 values are. * Choose None to remove all AFD values from  this
                 output. * Choose Fixed to ignore input AFD values and instead
                 encode the value specified in the job. * Choose Auto to  cal-
                 culate output AFD values based on the input AFD scaler data.

              AntiAlias -> (string)
                 The  anti-alias  filter  is automatically applied to all out-
                 puts. The service no longer accepts the  value  DISABLED  for
                 AntiAlias.  If you specify that in your job, the service will
                 ignore the setting.

              CodecSettings -> (structure)
                 Video codec settings contains the group of  settings  related
                 to  video encoding. The settings in this group vary depending
                 on the value that you choose for Video codec. For each  codec
                 enum  that  you choose, define the corresponding settings ob-
                 ject. The following lists the  codec  enum,  settings  object
                 pairs.  *  AV1,  Av1Settings  * AVC_INTRA, AvcIntraSettings *
                 FRAME_CAPTURE, FrameCaptureSettings * H_264,  H264Settings  *
                 H_265,  H265Settings * MPEG2, Mpeg2Settings * PRORES, Prores-
                 Settings * VC3, Vc3Settings * VP8, Vp8Settings * VP9, Vp9Set-
                 tings * XAVC, XavcSettings

                 Av1Settings -> (structure)
                     Required   when   you   set  Codec,  under  VideoDescrip-
                     tion>CodecSettings to the value AV1.

                     AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Specify the strength of any adaptive quantization fil-
                        ters  that  you enable. The value that you choose here
                        applies to Spatial adaptive quantization.

                     BitDepth -> (string)
                        Specify the Bit depth. You can choose 8-bit or 10-bit.

                     FilmGrainSynthesis -> (string)
                        Film grain synthesis replaces film  grain  present  in
                        your content with similar quality synthesized AV1 film
                        grain. We recommend that you choose Enabled to  reduce
                        the bandwidth of your QVBR quality level 5, 6, 7, or 8
                        outputs. For QVBR quality level 9  or  10  outputs  we
                        recommend  that  you keep the default value, Disabled.
                        When you include Film grain synthesis, you cannot  in-
                        clude the Noise reducer preprocessor.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        Use  the  Framerate  setting to specify the frame rate
                        for this output. If you want to keep  the  same  frame
                        rate  as the input video, choose Follow source. If you
                        want to do frame rate conversion, choose a frame  rate
                        from  the  dropdown list or choose Custom. The framer-
                        ates shown in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                        tions of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify your
                        frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        Specify  the GOP length (keyframe interval) in frames.
                        With AV1, MediaConvert doesn't support GOP  length  in
                        seconds.  This  value  must  be  greater than zero and
                        preferably equal to 1 + ((numberBFrames  +  1)  *  x),
                        where x is an integer value.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Maximum  bitrate  in  bits/second.  For example, enter
                        five megabits per second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                        Rate control mode is QVBR.

                     NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Specify  from  the number of B-frames, in the range of
                        0-15. For AV1 encoding, we recommend using  7  or  15.
                        Choose a larger number for a lower bitrate and smaller
                        file size; choose a smaller number  for  better  video
                        quality.

                     QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate encoding
                        with the H.265 codec. Use these settings only when you
                        set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting  only when you set Rate control
                            mode to QVBR. Specify the target quality level for
                            this  output.  MediaConvert  determines  the right
                            number of bits to use for each part of  the  video
                            to  maintain  the  video quality that you specify.
                            When you keep the default value,  AUTO,  MediaCon-
                            vert picks a quality level for you, based on char-
                            acteristics of your input video. If you prefer  to
                            specify  a  quality level, specify a number from 1
                            through 10. Use higher numbers for  greater  qual-
                            ity.  Level 10 results in nearly lossless compres-
                            sion. The quality level for most broadcast-quality
                            transcodes  is  between  6  and  9. Optionally, to
                            specify a value between whole numbers,  also  pro-
                            vide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                            Tune. For example, if you want your  QVBR  quality
                            level  to  be  7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and
                            set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

                        QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                            Optional. Specify a value here  to  set  the  QVBR
                            quality  to a level that is between whole numbers.
                            For example, if you want your QVBR  quality  level
                            to  be  7.33,  set  qvbrQualityLevel  to 7 and set
                            qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to   .33.   MediaConvert
                            rounds  your  QVBR  quality  level  to the nearest
                            third of a whole number. For example, if  you  set
                            qvbrQualityLevel   to  7  and  you  set  qvbrQual-
                            ityLevelFineTune to .25, your actual QVBR  quality
                            level is 7.33.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        'With AV1 outputs, for rate control mode, MediaConvert
                        supports only quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).
                        You can''t use CBR or VBR.'

                     Slices -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  number of slices per picture. This value
                        must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.  For  progressive  pic-
                        tures,  this  value  must be less than or equal to the
                        number of macroblock rows.  For  interlaced  pictures,
                        this value must be less than or equal to half the num-
                        ber of macroblock rows.

                     SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep the default value, Enabled, to  adjust  quantiza-
                        tion  within  each frame based on spatial variation of
                        content complexity. When you enable this feature,  the
                        encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more
                        distortion with no noticeable visual  degradation  and
                        uses  more  bits  on  areas where any small distortion
                        will be  noticeable.  For  example,  complex  textured
                        blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured
                        blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this  fea-
                        ture  will  almost  always improve your video quality.
                        Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into  ac-
                        count where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If
                        viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
                        part  of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you
                        might choose to disable this feature. Related setting:
                        When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the
                        value for Adaptive quantization depending on your con-
                        tent.  For  homogeneous  content, such as cartoons and
                        video games, set it to Low. For content with  a  wider
                        variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

                 AvcIntraSettings -> (structure)
                     Required  when you choose AVC-Intra for your output video
                     codec. For more information about the AVC-Intra settings,
                     see  the relevant specification. For detailed information
                     about     SD     and     HD     in     AVC-Intra,     see
                     https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7290936.  For infor-
                     mation     about     4K/2K     in     AVC-Intra,      see

                     AvcIntraClass -> (string)
                        Specify  the  AVC-Intra  class  of  your  output.  The
                        AVC-Intra  class selection determines the output video
                        bit rate depending on the frame rate  of  the  output.
                        Outputs  with higher class values have higher bitrates
                        and improved image quality. Note that for Class 4K/2K,
                        MediaConvert supports only 4:2:2 chroma subsampling.

                     AvcIntraUhdSettings -> (structure)
                        Optional  when you set AVC-Intra class to Class 4K/2K.
                        When you set AVC-Intra class  to  a  different  value,
                        this object isn't allowed.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level to choose how
                            many transcoding  passes  MediaConvert  does  with
                            your video. When you choose Multi-pass, your video
                            quality is better and your output bitrate is  more
                            accurate. That is, the actual bitrate of your out-
                            put is closer to the target bitrate defined in the
                            specification.  When  you choose Single-pass, your
                            encoding time is faster. The default  behavior  is
                            Single-pass.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you  are using the console, use the Framerate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list  are  decimal approximations of fractions. If you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the de-
                        fault value, Progressive to create a progressive  out-
                        put,  regardless  of  the scan type of your input. Use
                        Top field first or Bottom field  first  to  create  an
                        output  that's interlaced with the same field polarity
                        throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default
                        bottom to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                        as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the
                        output  field polarity might change over the course of
                        the output. Follow behavior depends on the input  scan
                        type.  If the source is interlaced, the output will be
                        interlaced with the same polarity as  the  source.  If
                        the  source  is progressive, the output will be inter-
                        laced with top field bottom field first, depending  on
                        which of the Follow options you choose.

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting  for  interlaced outputs, when your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced field in the output. Keep the default  value,
                        Basic  interlacing,  for all other output frame rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame  rate  conversion  first and then interlaces the
                        frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and  you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally  falls  back to basic interlacing. Required set-
                        tings: To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                        Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL,
                        MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25  fps  and
                        resamples  your audio to keep it synchronized with the
                        video. Note that enabling this setting  will  slightly
                        reduce  the duration of your video. Required settings:
                        You must also set Framerate to 25.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        When you do frame rate conversion from  23.976  frames
                        per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your output scan
                        type is interlaced, you  can  optionally  enable  hard
                        telecine  to  create a smoother picture. When you keep
                        the default value, None, MediaConvert does a  standard
                        frame  rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything
                        with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                 Codec -> (string)
                     Specifies the video codec. This must be equal to  one  of
                     the  enum  values  defined  by  the object VideoCodec. To
                     passthrough the video  stream  of  your  input  JPEG2000,
                     VC-3,  AVC-INTRA  or Apple ProRes video without any video
                     encoding: Choose Passthrough. If you have multiple  input
                     videos,  note  that they must have identical encoding at-
                     tributes. When you choose Passthrough, your  output  con-
                     tainer must be MXF or QuickTime MOV.

                 FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value FRAME_CAPTURE.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        Frame  capture will encode the first frame of the out-
                        put stream, then one  frame  every  framerateDenomina-
                        tor/framerateNumerator  seconds. For example, settings
                        of framerateNumerator = 1 and framerateDenominator = 3
                        (a  rate  of  1/3  frame  per second) will capture the
                        first frame, then 1 frame  every  3s.  Files  will  be
                        named  as  filename.n.jpg  where  n is the 0-based se-
                        quence number of each Capture.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        Frame capture will encode the first frame of the  out-
                        put  stream,  then  one frame every framerateDenomina-
                        tor/framerateNumerator seconds. For example,  settings
                        of framerateNumerator = 1 and framerateDenominator = 3
                        (a rate of 1/3 frame  per  second)  will  capture  the
                        first  frame,  then  1  frame  every 3s. Files will be
                        named as filename.NNNNNNN.jpg where N is  the  0-based
                        frame sequence number zero padded to 7 decimal places.

                     MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                        Maximum number of captures (encoded jpg output files).

                     Quality -> (integer)
                        JPEG Quality - a higher value equals higher quality.

                 H264Settings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value H_264.

                     AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep the default value, Auto, for this setting to have
                        MediaConvert automatically apply  the  best  types  of
                        quantization  for your video content. When you want to
                        apply your quantization settings  manually,  you  must
                        set  H264AdaptiveQuantization  to  a  value other than
                        Auto. Use this setting to specify the strength of  any
                        adaptive  quantization filters that you enable. If you
                        don't want MediaConvert to do any  adaptive  quantiza-
                        tion  in  this transcode, set Adaptive quantization to
                        Off. Related settings: The value that you choose  here
                        applies  to  the  following settings: H264FlickerAdap-
                        tiveQuantization, H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization, and
                        H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization.

                     BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                        The  Bandwidth  reduction  filter  increases the video
                        quality of your output relative to its bitrate. Use to
                        lower  the  bitrate of your constant quality QVBR out-
                        put, with little or no perceptual decrease in quality.
                        Or,  use to increase the video quality of outputs with
                        other rate control modes relative to the bitrate  that
                        you  specify.  Bandwidth  reduction  increases further
                        when your input is low quality or noisy. Outputs  that
                        use  this feature incur pro-tier pricing. When you in-
                        clude Bandwidth reduction filter, you  cannot  include
                        the Noise reducer preprocessor.

                        Sharpening -> (string)
                            Optionally  specify the level of sharpening to ap-
                            ply when you use the Bandwidth  reduction  filter.
                            Sharpening  adds  contrast  to  the  edges of your
                            video content and can reduce  softness.  Keep  the
                            default  value  Off  to  apply  no sharpening. Set
                            Sharpening strength to  Low  to  apply  a  minimal
                            amount  of  sharpening, or High to apply a maximum
                            amount of sharpening.

                        Strength -> (string)
                            Specify the strength of  the  Bandwidth  reduction
                            filter.  For most workflows, we recommend that you
                            choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of your output
                            with  little  to  no  perceptual decrease in video
                            quality. For high quality and  high  bitrate  out-
                            puts,  choose  Low.  For the most bandwidth reduc-
                            tion, choose High. We recommend  that  you  choose
                            High  for  low bitrate outputs. Note that High may
                            incur a slight increase in the  softness  of  your
                            output.

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  average  bitrate in bits per second. Re-
                        quired for VBR and CBR. For  MS  Smooth  outputs,  bi-
                        trates must be unique when rounded down to the nearest
                        multiple of 1000.

                     CodecLevel -> (string)
                        Specify an H.264 level that is  consistent  with  your
                        output  video  settings. If you aren't sure what level
                        to specify, choose Auto.

                     CodecProfile -> (string)
                        H.264 Profile. High 4:2:2 and 10-bit profiles are only
                        available with the AVC-I License.

                     DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                        Specify  whether  to  allow  the number of B-frames in
                        your output GOP structure to vary or not depending  on
                        your  input  video  content. To improve the subjective
                        video quality of your output that has high-motion con-
                        tent:  Leave blank or keep the default value Adaptive.
                        MediaConvert will use fewer B-frames  for  high-motion
                        video  content  than  low-motion  content. The maximum
                        number of B- frames is limited by the value  that  you
                        choose  for  B-frames between reference frames. To use
                        the same number B-frames for  all  types  of  content:
                        Choose Static.

                     EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                        Optionally  include  or suppress markers at the end of
                        your output that signal the end of the  video  stream.
                        To  include end of stream markers: Leave blank or keep
                        the default value, Include.  To  not  include  end  of
                        stream  markers:  Choose Suppress. This is useful when
                        your output will be inserted into another stream.

                     EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                        Entropy encoding mode. Use CABAC (must be in  Main  or
                        High profile) or CAVLC.

                     FieldEncoding -> (string)
                        The  video encoding method for your MPEG-4 AVC output.
                        Keep the default value, PAFF, to have MediaConvert use
                        PAFF  encoding  for  interlaced  outputs. Choose Force
                        field to disable PAFF encoding and create separate in-
                        terlaced fields. Choose MBAFF to disable PAFF and have
                        MediaConvert use MBAFF encoding  for  interlaced  out-
                        puts.

                     FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Only  use  this  setting  when  you change the default
                        value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization.
                        When  you  keep  all defaults, excluding H264Adaptive-
                        Quantization and all other adaptive quantization  from
                        your  JSON  job  specification, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally applies the best types of quantization for  your
                        video  content.  When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization
                        to a value other than  AUTO,  the  default  value  for
                        H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization  is  Disabled.  Change
                        this value to Enabled to reduce I-frame  pop.  I-frame
                        pop  appears  as  a visual flicker that can arise when
                        the encoder saves bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks
                        many  times  from  frame  to frame, and then refreshes
                        them at the I-frame. When you enable this setting, the
                        encoder  updates these macroblocks slightly more often
                        to smooth out the flicker. To manually enable or  dis-
                        able  H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization,  you  must  set
                        Adaptive quantization to a value other than AUTO.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If you are using the console, use the  Framerate  set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want to keep the same frame rate as the  input  video,
                        choose  Follow  source.  If  you want to do frame rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list are decimal approximations of fractions.  If  you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to use
                        when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For  nu-
                        merically  simple  conversions,  such  as 60 fps to 30
                        fps: We recommend that you  keep  the  default  value,
                        Drop  duplicate.  For numerically complex conversions,
                        to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results  in
                        a  smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce undesirable
                        video artifacts. For complex frame  rate  conversions,
                        especially  if your source video has already been con-
                        verted from its original cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer
                        to  do  motion-compensated  interpolation. FrameFormer
                        uses the best conversion method frame by  frame.  Note
                        that  using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time
                        and incurs a significant add-on cost. When you  choose
                        FrameFormer,  your  input  video resolution must be at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator  to  specify the denominator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.   When   you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value  as a decimal number for Framerate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.  Use  Framer-
                        ateNumerator  to  specify  the numerator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use  24000  for  the  value  of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value  as a decimal number for Framerate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopBReference -> (string)
                        Specify whether to allow B-frames to be referenced  by
                        other frame types. To use reference B-frames when your
                        GOP structure has 1 or more B-frames: Leave  blank  or
                        keep  the default value Enabled. We recommend that you
                        choose Enabled to help improve the  video  quality  of
                        your output relative to its bitrate. To not use refer-
                        ence B-frames: Choose Disabled.

                     GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                        Specify the relative frequency of open to closed  GOPs
                        in this output. For example, if you want to allow four
                        open GOPs and then require  a  closed  GOP,  set  this
                        value  to 5. We recommend that you have the transcoder
                        automatically choose this value for you based on char-
                        acteristics  of  your  input video. In the console, do
                        this by keeping the default empty value. If you do ex-
                        plicitly specify a value, for segmented outputs, don't
                        set this value to 0.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        Use this setting only when you set GOP mode control to
                        Specified,  frames  or Specified, seconds. Specify the
                        GOP length using a whole number of frames or a decimal
                        value  of  seconds.  MediaConvert  will interpret this
                        value as frames or seconds depending on the value  you
                        choose  for GOP mode control. If you want to allow Me-
                        diaConvert to automatically determine GOP size,  leave
                        GOP  size  blank  and set GOP mode control to Auto. If
                        your output group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,  leave
                        GOP  size  blank  and  set GOP mode control to Auto in
                        each output in your output group.

                     GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                        Specify how the transcoder  determines  GOP  size  for
                        this output. We recommend that you have the transcoder
                        automatically choose this value for you based on char-
                        acteristics  of your input video. To enable this auto-
                        matic behavior, choose Auto and  and  leave  GOP  size
                        blank.  By default, if you don't specify GOP mode con-
                        trol, MediaConvert will  use  automatic  behavior.  If
                        your  output  group  specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, set
                        GOP mode control to Auto and leave GOP size  blank  in
                        each  output in your output group. To explicitly spec-
                        ify the GOP length, choose Specified, frames or Speci-
                        fied,  seconds  and then provide the GOP length in the
                        related setting GOP size.

                     HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        If your downstream systems have strict buffer require-
                        ments:  Specify the minimum percentage of the HRD buf-
                        fer that's available at the end of each encoded  video
                        segment. For the best video quality: Set to 0 or leave
                        blank to automatically determine the final buffer fill
                        percentage.

                     HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        Percentage  of  the  buffer  that  should initially be
                        filled (HRD buffer model).

                     HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                        Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For  exam-
                        ple, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the de-
                        fault value, Progressive to create a progressive  out-
                        put,  regardless  of  the scan type of your input. Use
                        Top field first or Bottom field  first  to  create  an
                        output  that's interlaced with the same field polarity
                        throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default
                        bottom to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                        as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the
                        output  field polarity might change over the course of
                        the output. Follow behavior depends on the input  scan
                        type.  If the source is interlaced, the output will be
                        interlaced with the same polarity as  the  source.  If
                        the  source  is progressive, the output will be inter-
                        laced with top field bottom field first, depending  on
                        which of the Follow options you choose.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Maximum  bitrate  in  bits/second.  For example, enter
                        five megabits per second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                        Rate control mode is QVBR.

                     MinIInterval -> (integer)
                        Use  this  setting  only  when  you  also enable Scene
                        change detection. This setting determines how the  en-
                        coder manages the spacing between I-frames that it in-
                        serts as part of the I-frame cadence and the  I-frames
                        that  it inserts for Scene change detection. We recom-
                        mend that you have the transcoder automatically choose
                        this  value  for  you based on characteristics of your
                        input video. To enable  this  automatic  behavior,  do
                        this  by keeping the default empty value. When you ex-
                        plicitly specify a value for this setting, the encoder
                        determines whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by
                        the value you set. For example, if you set Min  I  in-
                        terval  to  5  and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall
                        within 5 frames of a scene-change  I-frame,  then  the
                        encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                        one GOP is shrunk slightly and one  GOP  is  stretched
                        slightly. When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther
                        from the scene-change I-frame than the value you  set,
                        then  the encoder leaves all I-frames in place and the
                        GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller than the
                        usual cadence GOPs.

                     NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  number  of  B-frames  between  reference
                        frames in this output. For  the  best  video  quality:
                        Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines the
                        number of B-frames to use based on the characteristics
                        of your input video. To manually specify the number of
                        B-frames between reference frames:  Enter  an  integer
                        from 0 to 7.

                     NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may use
                        more than requested if using  B-frames  and/or  inter-
                        laced encoding.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The default behav-
                        ior, Follow source, uses the PAR from your input video
                        for your output. To specify a  different  PAR  in  the
                        console,  choose  any  value other than Follow source.
                        When you choose SPECIFIED for this setting,  you  must
                        also specify values for the parNumerator and parDenom-
                        inator settings.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                        The Quality  tuning  level  you  choose  represents  a
                        trade-off  between  the encoding speed of your job and
                        the output video quality.  For  the  fastest  encoding
                        speed  at  the  cost  of  video quality: Choose Single
                        pass. For a good balance between  encoding  speed  and
                        video  quality:  Leave blank or keep the default value
                        Single pass HQ. For the best  video  quality,  at  the
                        cost  of  encoding speed: Choose Multi pass HQ. Media-
                        Convert performs an analysis pass on your  input  fol-
                        lowed  by an encoding pass. Outputs that use this fea-
                        ture incur pro-tier pricing.

                     QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate encoding
                        with the H.265 codec. Use these settings only when you
                        set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                        MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                            Use this setting only when Rate  control  mode  is
                            QVBR  and  Quality  tuning level is Multi-pass HQ.
                            For Max average bitrate values suited to the  com-
                            plexity  of  your  input video, the service limits
                            the average bitrate of the video part of this out-
                            put to the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                            tal size of the video  element  is  less  than  or
                            equal  to the value you set multiplied by the num-
                            ber of seconds of encoded output.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Use this setting only when you  set  Rate  control
                            mode to QVBR. Specify the target quality level for
                            this output.  MediaConvert  determines  the  right
                            number  of  bits to use for each part of the video
                            to maintain the video quality  that  you  specify.
                            When  you  keep the default value, AUTO, MediaCon-
                            vert picks a quality level for you, based on char-
                            acteristics  of your input video. If you prefer to
                            specify a quality level, specify a number  from  1
                            through  10.  Use higher numbers for greater qual-
                            ity. Level 10 results in nearly lossless  compres-
                            sion. The quality level for most broadcast-quality
                            transcodes is between  6  and  9.  Optionally,  to
                            specify  a  value between whole numbers, also pro-
                            vide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                            Tune.  For  example, if you want your QVBR quality
                            level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and
                            set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

                        QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                            Optional.  Specify  a  value  here to set the QVBR
                            quality to a level that is between whole  numbers.
                            For  example,  if you want your QVBR quality level
                            to be 7.33, set  qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                            qvbrQualityLevelFineTune   to   .33.  MediaConvert
                            rounds your QVBR  quality  level  to  the  nearest
                            third  of  a whole number. For example, if you set
                            qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  you  set   qvbrQual-
                            ityLevelFineTune  to .25, your actual QVBR quality
                            level is 7.33.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        Use this setting to specify whether this output has  a
                        variable  bitrate  (VBR),  constant  bitrate  (CBR) or
                        quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                     RepeatPps -> (string)
                        Places a PPS header on each encoded picture,  even  if
                        repeated.

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting  for  interlaced outputs, when your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced field in the output. Keep the default  value,
                        Basic  interlacing,  for all other output frame rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame  rate  conversion  first and then interlaces the
                        frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and  you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally  falls  back to basic interlacing. Required set-
                        tings: To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                        Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                        Enable  this  setting  to  insert  I-frames  at  scene
                        changes that the service automatically  detects.  This
                        improves  video  quality and is enabled by default. If
                        this output uses QVBR, choose Transition detection for
                        further  video  quality improvement. For more informa-

                     Slices -> (integer)
                        Number of slices per picture. Must  be  less  than  or
                        equal to the number of macroblock rows for progressive
                        pictures, and less than or equal to half the number of
                        macroblock rows for interlaced pictures.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL,
                        MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25  fps  and
                        resamples  your audio to keep it synchronized with the
                        video. Note that enabling this setting  will  slightly
                        reduce  the duration of your video. Required settings:
                        You must also set Framerate to 25.

                     Softness -> (integer)
                        Ignore this setting unless you need to comply  with  a
                        specification  that  requires a specific value. If you
                        don't have a specification requirement,  we  recommend
                        that you adjust the softness of your output by using a
                        lower value for the setting Sharpness or by enabling a
                        noise  reducer  filter. The Softness setting specifies
                        the quantization matrices that the encoder uses.  Keep
                        the  default  value,  0, for flat quantization. Choose
                        the value 1 or 16 to use  the  default  JVT  softening
                        quantization  matricies  from the H.264 specification.
                        Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar interpola-
                        tion.  Increasing  values from 17 to 128 result in in-
                        creasing reduction of high-frequency data.  The  value
                        128 results in the softest video.

                     SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Only  use  this  setting  when  you change the default
                        value, Auto, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization.
                        When  you  keep  all defaults, excluding H264Adaptive-
                        Quantization and all other adaptive quantization  from
                        your  JSON  job  specification, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally applies the best types of quantization for  your
                        video  content.  When you set H264AdaptiveQuantization
                        to a value other than  AUTO,  the  default  value  for
                        H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization  is Enabled. Keep this
                        default value to adjust quantization within each frame
                        based on spatial variation of content complexity. When
                        you enable this feature, the encoder uses  fewer  bits
                        on  areas that can sustain more distortion with no no-
                        ticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on  ar-
                        eas where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
                        example, complex  textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                        fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with
                        more bits. Enabling this feature  will  almost  always
                        improve  your  video  quality. Note, though, that this
                        feature doesn't take into account where  the  viewer's
                        attention is likely to be. If viewers are likely to be
                        focusing their attention on a part of the screen  with
                        a  lot  of  complex  texture,  you might choose to set
                        H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization to  Disabled.  Related
                        setting:  When  you  enable spatial adaptive quantiza-
                        tion, set the value for Adaptive quantization  depend-
                        ing  on your content. For homogeneous content, such as
                        cartoons and video games, set it to Low.  For  content
                        with  a  wider  variety of textures, set it to High or
                        Higher. To manually enable or disable H264SpatialAdap-
                        tiveQuantization,  you  must set Adaptive quantization
                        to a value other than AUTO.

                        Produces a bitstream compliant with SMPTE RP-2027.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        When you do frame rate conversion from  23.976  frames
                        per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your output scan
                        type is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard  or
                        soft  telecine  to  create  a  smoother  picture. Hard
                        telecine produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine  pro-
                        duces  an  output with a 23.976 output that signals to
                        the video player device to do  the  conversion  during
                        play  back. When you keep the default value, None, Me-
                        diaConvert does a standard frame  rate  conversion  to
                        29.97  without  doing anything with the field polarity
                        to create a smoother picture.

                     TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Only use this setting  when  you  change  the  default
                        value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantization.
                        When you keep all  defaults,  excluding  H264Adaptive-
                        Quantization  and all other adaptive quantization from
                        your JSON job  specification,  MediaConvert  automati-
                        cally  applies the best types of quantization for your
                        video content. When you  set  H264AdaptiveQuantization
                        to  a  value  other  than  AUTO, the default value for
                        H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization is Enabled. Keep this
                        default value to adjust quantization within each frame
                        based on temporal  variation  of  content  complexity.
                        When  you  enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                        bits on areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses
                        more  bits  on  complex  objects with sharp edges that
                        move a lot. For example,  this  feature  improves  the
                        readability  of  text  tickers on newscasts and score-
                        boards on sports matches. Enabling this  feature  will
                        almost   always  improve  your  video  quality.  Note,
                        though, that this feature doesn't  take  into  account
                        where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If view-
                        ers are likely to be focusing  their  attention  on  a
                        part  of  the  screen that doesn't have moving objects
                        with sharp edges, such as sports athletes' faces,  you
                        might  choose  to set H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization
                        to Disabled. Related setting: When you enable temporal
                        quantization,  adjust  the strength of the filter with
                        the setting Adaptive quantization. To manually  enable
                        or  disable H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization, you must
                        set Adaptive quantization to a value other than AUTO.

                     AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        When  you  set Adaptive Quantization to Auto, or leave
                        blank, MediaConvert automatically applies quantization
                        to improve the video quality of your output. Set Adap-
                        tive Quantization to Low, Medium, High, Higher, or Max
                        to  manually  control the strength of the quantization
                        filter. When you do, you can specify a value for  Spa-
                        tial  Adaptive Quantization, Temporal Adaptive Quanti-
                        zation, and Flicker Adaptive Quantization, to  further
                        control  the quantization filter. Set Adaptive Quanti-
                        zation to Off to apply no quantization to your output.

                     AlternateTransferFunctionSei -> (string)
                        Enables Alternate Transfer Function  SEI  message  for
                        outputs  using  Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) Electro-Optical
                        Transfer Function (EOTF).

                     BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                        The Bandwidth reduction  filter  increases  the  video
                        quality of your output relative to its bitrate. Use to
                        lower the bitrate of your constant quality  QVBR  out-
                        put, with little or no perceptual decrease in quality.
                        Or, use to increase the video quality of outputs  with
                        other  rate control modes relative to the bitrate that
                        you specify.  Bandwidth  reduction  increases  further
                        when  your input is low quality or noisy. Outputs that
                        use this feature incur pro-tier pricing. When you  in-
                        clude  Bandwidth  reduction filter, you cannot include
                        the Noise reducer preprocessor.

                        Sharpening -> (string)
                            Optionally specify the level of sharpening to  ap-
                            ply  when  you use the Bandwidth reduction filter.
                            Sharpening adds contrast  to  the  edges  of  your
                            video  content  and  can reduce softness. Keep the
                            default value Off  to  apply  no  sharpening.  Set
                            Sharpening  strength  to  Low  to  apply a minimal
                            amount of sharpening, or High to apply  a  maximum
                            amount of sharpening.

                        Strength -> (string)
                            Specify  the  strength  of the Bandwidth reduction
                            filter. For most workflows, we recommend that  you
                            choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of your output
                            with little to no  perceptual  decrease  in  video
                            quality.  For  high  quality and high bitrate out-
                            puts, choose Low. For the  most  bandwidth  reduc-
                            tion,  choose  High.  We recommend that you choose
                            High for low bitrate outputs. Note that  High  may
                            incur  a  slight  increase in the softness of your
                            output.

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Specify the average bitrate in bits  per  second.  Re-
                        quired  for  VBR  and  CBR. For MS Smooth outputs, bi-
                        trates must be unique when rounded down to the nearest
                        multiple of 1000.

                     CodecLevel -> (string)
                        H.265 Level.

                     CodecProfile -> (string)
                        Represents  the Profile and Tier, per the HEVC (H.265)
                        specification. Selections are grouped as  [Profile]  /
                        [Tier],  so  "Main/High"  represents Main Profile with
                        High Tier. 4:2:2 profiles are only available with  the
                        HEVC 4:2:2 License.

                     DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                        Specify  whether  to  allow  the number of B-frames in
                        your output GOP structure to vary or not depending  on
                        your  input  video  content. To improve the subjective
                        video quality of your output that has high-motion con-
                        tent:  Leave blank or keep the default value Adaptive.
                        MediaConvert will use fewer B-frames  for  high-motion
                        video  content  than  low-motion  content. The maximum
                        number of B- frames is limited by the value  that  you
                        choose  for  B-frames between reference frames. To use
                        the same number B-frames for  all  types  of  content:
                        Choose Static.

                     EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                        Optionally  include  or suppress markers at the end of
                        your output that signal the end of the  video  stream.
                        To  include end of stream markers: Leave blank or keep
                        the default value, Include.  To  not  include  end  of
                        stream  markers:  Choose Suppress. This is useful when
                        your output will be inserted into another stream.

                     FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Enable this setting to have the encoder reduce I-frame
                        pop.  I-frame pop appears as a visual flicker that can
                        arise when the encoder saves bits by copying some mac-
                        roblocks  many times from frame to frame, and then re-
                        freshes them at the I-frame. When you enable this set-
                        ting,  the  encoder updates these macroblocks slightly
                        more often to smooth out the flicker. This setting  is
                        disabled  by  default. Related setting: In addition to
                        enabling this setting, you must also set adaptiveQuan-
                        tization to a value other than Off.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        Use  the  Framerate  setting to specify the frame rate
                        for this output. If you want to keep  the  same  frame
                        rate  as the input video, choose Follow source. If you
                        want to do frame rate conversion, choose a frame  rate
                        from  the  dropdown list or choose Custom. The framer-
                        ates shown in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                        tions of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify your
                        frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopBReference -> (string)
                        Specify  whether to allow B-frames to be referenced by
                        other frame types. To use reference B-frames when your
                        GOP  structure  has 1 or more B-frames: Leave blank or
                        keep the default value Enabled. We recommend that  you
                        choose  Enabled  to  help improve the video quality of
                        your output relative to its bitrate. To not use refer-
                        ence B-frames: Choose Disabled.

                     GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                        Specify  the relative frequency of open to closed GOPs
                        in this output. For example, if you want to allow four
                        open  GOPs  and  then  require  a closed GOP, set this
                        value to 5. We recommend that you have the  transcoder
                        automatically choose this value for you based on char-
                        acteristics of your input video. To enable this  auto-
                        matic  behavior,  do this by keeping the default empty
                        value. If you do explicitly specify a value, for  seg-
                        mented outputs, don't set this value to 0.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        Use this setting only when you set GOP mode control to
                        Specified, frames or Specified, seconds.  Specify  the
                        GOP length using a whole number of frames or a decimal
                        value of seconds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret  this
                        value  as frames or seconds depending on the value you
                        choose for GOP mode control. If you want to allow  Me-
                        diaConvert  to automatically determine GOP size, leave
                        GOP size blank and set GOP mode control  to  Auto.  If
                        your  output group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave
                        GOP size blank and set GOP mode  control  to  Auto  in
                        each output in your output group.

                     GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                        Specify  how  the  transcoder  determines GOP size for
                        this output. We recommend that you have the transcoder
                        automatically choose this value for you based on char-
                        acteristics of your input video. To enable this  auto-
                        matic  behavior,  choose  Auto  and and leave GOP size
                        blank. By default, if you don't specify GOP mode  con-
                        trol,  MediaConvert  will  use  automatic behavior. If
                        your output group specifies HLS, DASH,  or  CMAF,  set
                        GOP  mode  control to Auto and leave GOP size blank in
                        each output in your output group. To explicitly  spec-
                        ify the GOP length, choose Specified, frames or Speci-
                        fied, seconds and then provide the GOP length  in  the
                        related setting GOP size.

                     HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        If your downstream systems have strict buffer require-
                        ments: Specify the minimum percentage of the HRD  buf-
                        fer  that's available at the end of each encoded video
                        segment. For the best video quality: Set to 0 or leave
                        blank to automatically determine the final buffer fill
                        percentage.

                     HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        Percentage of the  buffer  that  should  initially  be
                        filled (HRD buffer model).

                     HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                        Size  of  buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For exam-
                        ple, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the de-
                        fault  value, Progressive to create a progressive out-
                        put, regardless of the scan type of  your  input.  Use
                        Top  field  first  or  Bottom field first to create an
                        output that's interlaced with the same field  polarity
                        throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default
                        bottom to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                        as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the
                        output field polarity might change over the course  of
                        the  output. Follow behavior depends on the input scan
                        type. If the source is interlaced, the output will  be
                        interlaced  with  the  same polarity as the source. If
                        the source is progressive, the output will  be  inter-
                        laced  with top field bottom field first, depending on
                        which of the Follow options you choose.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,  enter
                        five  megabits  per  second  as 5000000. Required when
                        Rate control mode is QVBR.

                     MinIInterval -> (integer)
                        Use this setting  only  when  you  also  enable  Scene
                        change  detection. This setting determines how the en-
                        coder manages the spacing between I-frames that it in-
                        serts  as part of the I-frame cadence and the I-frames
                        that it inserts for Scene change detection. We  recom-
                        mend that you have the transcoder automatically choose
                        this value for you based on  characteristics  of  your
                        input  video.  To  enable  this automatic behavior, do
                        this by keeping the default empty value. When you  ex-
                        plicitly specify a value for this setting, the encoder
                        determines whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by
                        the  value  you set. For example, if you set Min I in-
                        terval to 5 and a cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                        within  5  frames  of a scene-change I-frame, then the
                        encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                        one  GOP  is  shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched
                        slightly. When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther
                        from  the scene-change I-frame than the value you set,
                        then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place and  the
                        GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller than the
                        usual cadence GOPs.

                     NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  number  of  B-frames  between  reference
                        frames  in  this  output.  For the best video quality:
                        Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines the
                        number of B-frames to use based on the characteristics
                        of your input video. To manually specify the number of
                        B-frames  between  reference  frames: Enter an integer
                        from 0 to 7.

                     NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may use
                        more  than  requested  if using B-frames and/or inter-
                        laced encoding.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The default behav-
                        ior, Follow source, uses the PAR from your input video
                        for  your  output.  To specify a different PAR, choose
                        any value other than Follow source.  When  you  choose
                        SPECIFIED for this setting, you must also specify val-
                        ues for the parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                        Optional. Use Quality tuning level to choose  how  you
                        want  to  trade  off  encoding  speed for output video
                        quality. The default behavior is faster,  lower  qual-
                        ity, single-pass encoding.

                     QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate encoding
                        with the H.265 codec. Use these settings only when you
                        set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                        MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting  only when Rate control mode is
                            QVBR and Quality tuning level  is  Multi-pass  HQ.
                            For  Max average bitrate values suited to the com-
                            plexity of your input video,  the  service  limits
                            the average bitrate of the video part of this out-
                            put to the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                            tal  size  of  the  video  element is less than or
                            equal to the value you set multiplied by the  num-
                            ber of seconds of encoded output.

                        QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting  only when you set Rate control
                            mode to QVBR. Specify the target quality level for
                            this  output.  MediaConvert  determines  the right
                            number of bits to use for each part of  the  video
                            to  maintain  the  video quality that you specify.
                            When you keep the default value,  AUTO,  MediaCon-
                            vert picks a quality level for you, based on char-
                            acteristics of your input video. If you prefer  to
                            specify  a  quality level, specify a number from 1
                            through 10. Use higher numbers for  greater  qual-
                            ity.  Level 10 results in nearly lossless compres-
                            sion. The quality level for most broadcast-quality
                            transcodes  is  between  6  and  9. Optionally, to
                            specify a value between whole numbers,  also  pro-
                            vide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                            Tune. For example, if you want your  QVBR  quality
                            level  to  be  7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and
                            set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

                        QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                            Optional. Specify a value here  to  set  the  QVBR
                            quality  to a level that is between whole numbers.
                            For example, if you want your QVBR  quality  level
                            to  be  7.33,  set  qvbrQualityLevel  to 7 and set
                            qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to   .33.   MediaConvert
                            rounds  your  QVBR  quality  level  to the nearest
                            third of a whole number. For example, if  you  set
                            qvbrQualityLevel   to  7  and  you  set  qvbrQual-
                            ityLevelFineTune to .25, your actual QVBR  quality
                            level is 7.33.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        Use  this setting to specify whether this output has a
                        variable bitrate  (VBR),  constant  bitrate  (CBR)  or
                        quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                     SampleAdaptiveOffsetFilterMode -> (string)
                        Specify  Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) filter strength.
                        Adaptive mode dynamically selects best strength  based
                        on content

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting  for  interlaced outputs, when your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced field in the output. Keep the default  value,
                        Basic  interlacing,  for all other output frame rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame  rate  conversion  first and then interlaces the
                        frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and  you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally  falls  back to basic interlacing. Required set-
                        tings: To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                        Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                        Enable  this  setting  to  insert  I-frames  at  scene
                        changes that the service automatically  detects.  This
                        improves  video  quality and is enabled by default. If
                        this output uses QVBR, choose Transition detection for
                        further  video  quality improvement. For more informa-
                        tion            about            QVBR,             see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/cbr-vbr-qvbr.

                     Slices -> (integer)
                        Number of slices per picture. Must  be  less  than  or
                        equal to the number of macroblock rows for progressive
                        pictures, and less than or equal to half the number of
                        macroblock rows for interlaced pictures.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL,
                        MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25  fps  and
                        resamples  your audio to keep it synchronized with the
                        video. Note that enabling this setting  will  slightly
                        reduce  the duration of your video. Required settings:
                        You must also set Framerate to 25.

                     SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep the default value, Enabled, to  adjust  quantiza-
                        tion  within  each frame based on spatial variation of
                        content complexity. When you enable this feature,  the
                        encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more
                        distortion with no noticeable visual  degradation  and
                        uses  more  bits  on  areas where any small distortion
                        will be  noticeable.  For  example,  complex  textured
                        blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured
                        blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this  fea-
                        ture  will  almost  always improve your video quality.
                        Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into  ac-
                        count where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If
                        viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
                        part  of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you
                        might choose to disable this feature. Related setting:
                        When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the
                        value for Adaptive quantization depending on your con-
                        tent.  For  homogeneous  content, such as cartoons and
                        video games, set it to Low. For content with  a  wider
                        variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        This  field  applies  only if the Streams > Advanced >
                        Framerate field is set to  29.970.  This  field  works
                        with the Streams > Advanced > Preprocessors > Deinter-
                        lacer field and the Streams >  Advanced  >  Interlaced
                        Mode  field  to identify the scan type for the output:
                        Progressive,  Interlaced,  Hard   Telecine   or   Soft
                        Telecine.  -  Hard: produces 29.97i output from 23.976
                        input. - Soft: produces 23.976;  the  player  converts
                        this output to 29.97i.

                     TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep  the  default value, Enabled, to adjust quantiza-
                        tion within each frame based on temporal variation  of
                        content  complexity. When you enable this feature, the
                        encoder uses fewer bits on areas  of  the  frame  that
                        aren't  moving  and  uses more bits on complex objects
                        with sharp edges that move a lot.  For  example,  this
                        feature  improves  the  readability of text tickers on
                        newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches.  Enabling
                        this  feature  will  almost  always improve your video
                        quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't  take
                        into account where the viewer's attention is likely to
                        be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their  atten-
                        tion  on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving
                        objects with sharp edges,  such  as  sports  athletes'
                        faces,  you  might choose to disable this feature. Re-
                        lated setting: When you enable temporal  quantization,
                        adjust  the  strength  of  the filter with the setting
                        Adaptive quantization.

                     TemporalIds -> (string)
                        Enables temporal layer identifiers in the encoded bit-
                        stream.  Up to 3 layers are supported depending on GOP
                        structure: I- and P-frames form one  layer,  reference
                        B-frames  can  form  a  second layer and non-reference
                        b-frames can form a third layer. Decoders can  option-
                        ally decode only the lower temporal layers to generate
                        a lower frame rate output. For example, given  a  bit-
                        stream  with  temporal IDs and with b-frames = 1 (i.e.
                        IbPbPb display order), a decoder could decode all  the
                        frames  for full frame rate output or only the I and P
                        frames (lowest temporal layer) for a half  frame  rate
                        output.

                     Tiles -> (string)
                        Enable  use  of  tiles, allowing horizontal as well as
                        vertical subdivision of the encoded pictures.

                     UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                        Inserts timecode for each frame as 4 bytes of  an  un-
                        registered SEI message.

                     WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                        If  the  location  of  parameter set NAL units doesn't
                        matter in your workflow, ignore this setting. Use this
                        setting only with CMAF or DASH outputs, or with stand-
                        alone file outputs in an MPEG-4  container  (MP4  out-
                        puts).  Choose  HVC1 to mark your output as HVC1. This
                        makes your output compliant with the following  speci-
                        fication:  ISO  IECJTC1  SC29 N13798 Text ISO/IEC FDIS
                        14496-15 3rd Edition. For these outputs,  the  service
                        stores  parameter  set NAL units in the sample headers
                        but not in the samples directly. For MP4 outputs, when
                        you  choose  HVC1,  your  output  video might not work
                        properly with some downstream systems and video  play-
                        ers.  The  service  defaults to marking your output as
                        HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes  parameter
                        set NAL units directly into the samples.

                 Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value MPEG2.

                     AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Specify the strength of any adaptive quantization fil-
                        ters that you enable. The value that you  choose  here
                        applies  to  the  following settings: Spatial adaptive
                        quantization, and Temporal adaptive quantization.

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Specify the average bitrate in bits  per  second.  Re-
                        quired  for  VBR  and  CBR. For MS Smooth outputs, bi-
                        trates must be unique when rounded down to the nearest
                        multiple of 1000.

                     CodecLevel -> (string)
                        Use  Level  to set the MPEG-2 level for the video out-
                        put.

                     CodecProfile -> (string)
                        Use Profile to set the MPEG-2 profile  for  the  video
                        output.

                     DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                        Choose  Adaptive  to  improve subjective video quality
                        for high-motion content. This will cause  the  service
                        to  use  fewer B-frames (which infer information based
                        on other frames) for high-motion portions of the video
                        and more B-frames for low-motion portions. The maximum
                        number of B-frames is limited by the value you provide
                        for the setting B frames between reference frames.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you  are using the console, use the Framerate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list  are  decimal approximations of fractions. If you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                        Specify  the relative frequency of open to closed GOPs
                        in this output. For example, if you want to allow four
                        open  GOPs  and  then  require  a closed GOP, set this
                        value to 5. When you create  a  streaming  output,  we
                        recommend  that you keep the default value, 1, so that
                        players starting mid-stream receive an  IDR  frame  as
                        quickly  as  possible. Don't set this value to 0; that
                        would break output segmenting.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        Specify the interval between keyframes, in seconds  or
                        frames, for this output. Default: 12 Related settings:
                        When you specify the GOP size in seconds, set GOP mode
                        control  to  Specified, seconds. The default value for
                        GOP mode control is Frames.

                     GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                        Specify the units for GOP size. If you don't specify a
                        value  here,  by default the encoder measures GOP size
                        in frames.

                     HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        If your downstream systems have strict buffer require-
                        ments:  Specify the minimum percentage of the HRD buf-
                        fer that's available at the end of each encoded  video
                        segment. For the best video quality: Set to 0 or leave
                        blank to automatically determine the final buffer fill
                        percentage.

                     HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                        Percentage  of  the  buffer  that  should initially be
                        filled (HRD buffer model).

                     HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                        Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For  exam-
                        ple, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the de-
                        fault value, Progressive to create a progressive  out-
                        put,  regardless  of  the scan type of your input. Use
                        Top field first or Bottom field  first  to  create  an
                        output  that's interlaced with the same field polarity
                        throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default
                        bottom to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                        as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the
                        output  field polarity might change over the course of
                        the output. Follow behavior depends on the input  scan
                        type.  If the source is interlaced, the output will be
                        interlaced with the same polarity as  the  source.  If
                        the  source  is progressive, the output will be inter-
                        laced with top field bottom field first, depending  on
                        which of the Follow options you choose.

                     IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                        Use  Intra  DC precision to set quantization precision
                        for intra-block DC coefficients.  If  you  choose  the
                        value  auto, the service will automatically select the
                        precision based on the per-frame compression ratio.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,  enter
                        five megabits per second as 5000000.

                     MinIInterval -> (integer)
                        Use  this  setting  only  when  you  also enable Scene
                        change detection. This setting determines how the  en-
                        coder manages the spacing between I-frames that it in-
                        serts as part of the I-frame cadence and the  I-frames
                        that  it  inserts for Scene change detection. When you
                        specify a value for this setting, the  encoder  deter-
                        mines  whether to skip a cadence-driven I-frame by the
                        value you set. For example, if you set Min I  interval
                        to  5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                        frames of a scene-change  I-frame,  then  the  encoder
                        skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one GOP
                        is shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched  slightly.
                        When  the cadence-driven I-frames are farther from the
                        scene-change I-frame than the value you set, then  the
                        encoder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs sur-
                        rounding the scene change are smaller than  the  usual
                        cadence GOPs.

                     NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                        Specify  the number of B-frames that MediaConvert puts
                        between reference frames in this output. Valid  values
                        are  whole  numbers  from  0 through 7. When you don't
                        specify a value, MediaConvert defaults to 2.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The default behav-
                        ior, Follow source, uses the PAR from your input video
                        for  your  output.  To  specify a different PAR in the
                        console, choose any value other  than  Follow  source.
                        When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this setting, you must
                        also specify values for the parNumerator and parDenom-
                        inator settings.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                        Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level to choose how you
                        want to trade off  encoding  speed  for  output  video
                        quality.  The  default behavior is faster, lower qual-
                        ity, single-pass encoding.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        Use Rate control mode to specify whether  the  bitrate
                        is variable (vbr) or constant (cbr).

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting  for  interlaced outputs, when your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced field in the output. Keep the default  value,
                        Basic  interlacing,  for all other output frame rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame  rate  conversion  first and then interlaces the
                        frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and  you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally  falls  back to basic interlacing. Required set-
                        tings: To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                        Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                        Enable  this  setting  to  insert  I-frames  at  scene
                        changes that the service automatically  detects.  This
                        improves video quality and is enabled by default.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL,
                        MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25  fps  and
                        resamples  your audio to keep it synchronized with the
                        video. Note that enabling this setting  will  slightly
                        reduce  the duration of your video. Required settings:
                        You must also set Framerate to 25.

                     Softness -> (integer)
                        Ignore this setting unless you need to comply  with  a
                        specification  that  requires a specific value. If you
                        don't have a specification requirement,  we  recommend
                        that you adjust the softness of your output by using a
                        lower value for the setting Sharpness or by enabling a
                        noise  reducer  filter. The Softness setting specifies
                        the quantization matrices that the encoder uses.  Keep
                        the default value, 0, to use the AWS Elemental default
                        matrices. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use  planar
                        interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result
                        in increasing reduction of  high-frequency  data.  The
                        value 128 results in the softest video.

                     SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep  the  default value, Enabled, to adjust quantiza-
                        tion within each frame based on spatial  variation  of
                        content  complexity. When you enable this feature, the
                        encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more
                        distortion  with  no noticeable visual degradation and
                        uses more bits on areas  where  any  small  distortion
                        will  be  noticeable.  For  example,  complex textured
                        blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured
                        blocks  are encoded with more bits. Enabling this fea-
                        ture will almost always improve  your  video  quality.
                        Note,  though, that this feature doesn't take into ac-
                        count where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If
                        viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
                        part of the screen with a lot of complex texture,  you
                        might choose to disable this feature. Related setting:
                        When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the
                        value for Adaptive quantization depending on your con-
                        tent. For homogeneous content, such  as  cartoons  and
                        video  games,  set it to Low. For content with a wider
                        variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

                     Syntax -> (string)
                        Specify whether this output's video uses the D10  syn-
                        tax. Keep the default value to not use the syntax. Re-
                        lated settings: When you choose D10 for your MXF  pro-
                        file, you must also set this value to D10.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        When  you  do frame rate conversion from 23.976 frames
                        per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and  your  output  scan
                        type  is interlaced, you can optionally enable hard or
                        soft telecine  to  create  a  smoother  picture.  Hard
                        telecine  produces a 29.97i output. Soft telecine pro-
                        duces an output with a 23.976 output that  signals  to
                        the  video  player  device to do the conversion during
                        play back. When you keep the default value, None,  Me-
                        diaConvert  does  a  standard frame rate conversion to
                        29.97 without doing anything with the  field  polarity
                        to create a smoother picture.

                     TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep  the  default value, Enabled, to adjust quantiza-
                        tion within each frame based on temporal variation  of
                        content  complexity. When you enable this feature, the
                        encoder uses fewer bits on areas  of  the  frame  that
                        aren't  moving  and  uses more bits on complex objects
                        with sharp edges that move a lot.  For  example,  this
                        feature  improves  the  readability of text tickers on
                        newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches.  Enabling
                        this  feature  will  almost  always improve your video
                        quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn't  take
                        into account where the viewer's attention is likely to
                        be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their  atten-
                        tion  on a part of the screen that doesn't have moving
                        objects with sharp edges,  such  as  sports  athletes'
                        faces,  you  might choose to disable this feature. Re-
                        lated setting: When you enable temporal  quantization,
                        adjust  the  strength  of  the filter with the setting
                        Adaptive quantization.

                 ProresSettings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value PRORES.

                     ChromaSampling -> (string)
                        This setting applies only to ProRes  4444  and  ProRes
                        4444  XQ  outputs that you create from inputs that use
                        4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Preserve 4:4:4 sampling  to
                        allow  outputs  to also use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. You
                        must specify a value for this setting when your output
                        codec  profile supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Related
                        Settings: For Apple ProRes outputs with  4:4:4  chroma
                        sampling:  Choose  Preserve  4:4:4  sampling. Use when
                        your input has 4:4:4 chroma sampling and  your  output
                        codec  Profile  is  Apple ProRes 4444 or 4444 XQ. Note
                        that when you choose Preserve 4:4:4 sampling, you can-
                        not  include any of the following Preprocessors: Dolby
                        Vision, HDR10+, or Noise reducer.

                     CodecProfile -> (string)
                        Use Profile to specify the type of Apple ProRes  codec
                        to use for this output.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you  are using the console, use the Framerate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list  are  decimal approximations of fractions. If you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the de-
                        fault value, Progressive to create a progressive  out-
                        put,  regardless  of  the scan type of your input. Use
                        Top field first or Bottom field  first  to  create  an
                        output  that's interlaced with the same field polarity
                        throughout. Use Follow, default top or Follow, default
                        bottom to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                        as the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs, the
                        output  field polarity might change over the course of
                        the output. Follow behavior depends on the input  scan
                        type.  If the source is interlaced, the output will be
                        interlaced with the same polarity as  the  source.  If
                        the  source  is progressive, the output will be inter-
                        laced with top field bottom field first, depending  on
                        which of the Follow options you choose.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The default behav-
                        ior, Follow source, uses the PAR from your input video
                        for your output. To specify a  different  PAR,  choose
                        any  value  other  than Follow source. When you choose
                        SPECIFIED for this setting, you must also specify val-
                        ues for the parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting  for  interlaced outputs, when your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced field in the output. Keep the default  value,
                        Basic  interlacing,  for all other output frame rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame  rate  conversion  first and then interlaces the
                        frames. When you choose Optimized interlacing and  you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally  falls  back to basic interlacing. Required set-
                        tings: To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                        Telecine  to None or Soft. You can't use optimized in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a 25 fps output. When you enable slow PAL,
                        MediaConvert relabels the video frames to 25  fps  and
                        resamples  your audio to keep it synchronized with the
                        video. Note that enabling this setting  will  slightly
                        reduce  the duration of your video. Required settings:
                        You must also set Framerate to 25.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        When you do frame rate conversion from  23.976  frames
                        per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your output scan
                        type is interlaced, you  can  optionally  enable  hard
                        telecine  to  create a smoother picture. When you keep
                        the default value, None, MediaConvert does a  standard
                        frame  rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything
                        with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                 Vc3Settings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value VC3

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If you are using the console, use the  Framerate  set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want to keep the same frame rate as the  input  video,
                        choose  Follow  source.  If  you want to do frame rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list are decimal approximations of fractions.  If  you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to use
                        when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For  nu-
                        merically  simple  conversions,  such  as 60 fps to 30
                        fps: We recommend that you  keep  the  default  value,
                        Drop  duplicate.  For numerically complex conversions,
                        to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results  in
                        a  smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce undesirable
                        video artifacts. For complex frame  rate  conversions,
                        especially  if your source video has already been con-
                        verted from its original cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer
                        to  do  motion-compensated  interpolation. FrameFormer
                        uses the best conversion method frame by  frame.  Note
                        that  using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time
                        and incurs a significant add-on cost. When you  choose
                        FrameFormer,  your  input  video resolution must be at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator  to  specify the denominator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.   When   you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value  as a decimal number for Framerate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.  Use  Framer-
                        ateNumerator  to  specify  the numerator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use  24000  for  the  value  of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value  as a decimal number for Framerate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     InterlaceMode -> (string)
                        Optional. Choose the scan line type for  this  output.
                        If you don't specify a value, MediaConvert will create
                        a progressive output.

                     ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                        Use this setting for  interlaced  outputs,  when  your
                        output frame rate is half of your input frame rate. In
                        this situation, choose Optimized interlacing to create
                        a better quality interlaced output. In this case, each
                        progressive frame from the input corresponds to an in-
                        terlaced  field in the output. Keep the default value,
                        Basic interlacing, for all other output  frame  rates.
                        With  basic  interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any
                        frame rate conversion first and  then  interlaces  the
                        frames.  When you choose Optimized interlacing and you
                        set your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                        able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally falls back to basic interlacing.  Required  set-
                        tings:  To  use  optimized  interlacing,  you must set
                        Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use optimized  in-
                        terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You must also set
                        Interlace mode to a value other than Progressive.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate  is
                        23.976  or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow PAL
                        to create a 25 fps  output  by  relabeling  the  video
                        frames  and  resampling your audio. Note that enabling
                        this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your
                        video.  Related  settings: You must also set Framerate
                        to 25.

                     Telecine -> (string)
                        When you do frame rate conversion from  23.976  frames
                        per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your output scan
                        type is interlaced, you  can  optionally  enable  hard
                        telecine  to  create a smoother picture. When you keep
                        the default value, None, MediaConvert does a  standard
                        frame  rate conversion to 29.97 without doing anything
                        with the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                     Vc3Class -> (string)
                        Specify the VC3 class to choose the quality character-
                        istics  for  this output. VC3 class, together with the
                        settings Framerate (framerateNumerator and  framerate-
                        Denominator) and Resolution (height and width), deter-
                        mine your output bitrate. For example, say  that  your
                        video  resolution  is  1920x1080 and your framerate is
                        29.97. Then Class 145 gives you an output with  a  bi-
                        trate  of  approximately  145 Mbps and Class 220 gives
                        you and output with a  bitrate  of  approximately  220
                        Mbps.  VC3 class also specifies the color bit depth of
                        your output.

                 Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value VP8.

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter five
                        megabits per second as 5000000.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you  are using the console, use the Framerate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        GOP  Length  (keyframe  interval)  in  frames. Must be
                        greater than zero.

                     HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                        Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer model)  in  bits.
                        For example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Ignore  this setting unless you set qualityTuningLevel
                        to MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the  maximum  bitrate
                        in  bits/second.  For example, enter five megabits per
                        second as 5000000. The default behavior uses twice the
                        target bitrate as the maximum bitrate.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The default behav-
                        ior, Follow source, uses the PAR from your input video
                        for your output. To specify a  different  PAR  in  the
                        console,  choose  any  value other than Follow source.
                        When you choose SPECIFIED for this setting,  you  must
                        also specify values for the parNumerator and parDenom-
                        inator settings.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                        Optional. Use Quality tuning level to choose  how  you
                        want  to  trade  off  encoding  speed for output video
                        quality. The default behavior is faster,  lower  qual-
                        ity, multi-pass encoding.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        With  the VP8 codec, you can use only the variable bi-
                        trate (VBR) rate control mode.

                 Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value VP9.

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter five
                        megabits per second as 5000000.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you  are using the console, use the Framerate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion, choose a frame rate from the dropdown list
                        or choose Custom. The framerates shown in the dropdown
                        list  are  decimal approximations of fractions. If you
                        choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a fraction.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose the method that you want  MediaConvert  to  use
                        when  increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For nu-
                        merically simple conversions, such as  60  fps  to  30
                        fps:  We  recommend  that  you keep the default value,
                        Drop duplicate. For numerically  complex  conversions,
                        to  avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results in
                        a smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce  undesirable
                        video  artifacts.  For complex frame rate conversions,
                        especially if your source video has already been  con-
                        verted  from  its original cadence: Choose FrameFormer
                        to do  motion-compensated  interpolation.  FrameFormer
                        uses  the  best conversion method frame by frame. Note
                        that using FrameFormer increases the transcoding  time
                        and  incurs a significant add-on cost. When you choose
                        FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be  at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator to specify the denominator of  this  frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.  When  you  use  the   console   for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For  example,  24000  / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framer-
                        ateNumerator to specify the numerator  of  this  frac-
                        tion.  In  this  example,  use  24000 for the value of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the value as a decimal number for Framerate.  In  this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     GopSize -> (double)
                        GOP  Length  (keyframe  interval)  in  frames. Must be
                        greater than zero.

                     HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                        Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For  exam-
                        ple, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                     MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                        Ignore  this setting unless you set qualityTuningLevel
                        to MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the  maximum  bitrate
                        in  bits/second.  For example, enter five megabits per
                        second as 5000000. The default behavior uses twice the
                        target bitrate as the maximum bitrate.

                     ParControl -> (string)
                        Optional. Specify how the service determines the pixel
                        aspect ratio for this output. The default behavior  is
                        to  use  the  same  pixel  aspect  ratio as your input
                        video.

                     ParDenominator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On  the  console,  this corresponds to any value other
                        than Follow source. When you specify an  output  pixel
                        aspect  ratio  (PAR) that is different from your input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you would specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parDe-
                        nominator is 33.

                     ParNumerator -> (integer)
                        Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECIFIED.
                        On the console, this corresponds to  any  value  other
                        than  Follow  source. When you specify an output pixel
                        aspect ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                        video PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio. For ex-
                        ample, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,  you  would  specify
                        the ratio 40:33. In this example, the value for parNu-
                        merator is 40.

                     QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                        Optional. Use Quality tuning level to choose  how  you
                        want  to  trade  off  encoding  speed for output video
                        quality. The default behavior is faster,  lower  qual-
                        ity, multi-pass encoding.

                     RateControlMode -> (string)
                        With  the VP9 codec, you can use only the variable bi-
                        trate (VBR) rate control mode.

                 XavcSettings -> (structure)
                     Required when you set Codec to the value XAVC.

                     AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        Keep the default value, Auto, for this setting to have
                        MediaConvert  automatically  apply  the  best types of
                        quantization for your video content. When you want  to
                        apply  your  quantization  settings manually, you must
                        set Adaptive quantization to a value other than  Auto.
                        Use  this setting to specify the strength of any adap-
                        tive quantization filters  that  you  enable.  If  you
                        don't  want  MediaConvert to do any adaptive quantiza-
                        tion in this transcode, set Adaptive  quantization  to
                        Off.  Related settings: The value that you choose here
                        applies to the following  settings:  Flicker  adaptive
                        quantization   (flickerAdaptiveQuantization),  Spatial
                        adaptive quantization, and Temporal adaptive quantiza-
                        tion.

                     EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                        Optional. Choose a specific entropy encoding mode only
                        when you want to override XAVC recommendations. If you
                        choose the value auto, MediaConvert uses the mode that
                        the XAVC file format specifies given this output's op-
                        erating point.

                     FramerateControl -> (string)
                        If  you are using the console, use the Frame rate set-
                        ting to specify the frame rate for this output. If you
                        want  to  keep the same frame rate as the input video,
                        choose Follow source. If you want  to  do  frame  rate
                        conversion,  choose  a  frame  rate  from the dropdown
                        list. The framerates shown in the  dropdown  list  are
                        decimal approximations of fractions.

                     FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                        Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to use
                        when increasing or decreasing the frame rate. For  nu-
                        merically  simple  conversions,  such  as 60 fps to 30
                        fps: We recommend that you  keep  the  default  value,
                        Drop  duplicate.  For numerically complex conversions,
                        to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate. This results  in
                        a  smooth  picture,  but  might  introduce undesirable
                        video artifacts. For complex frame  rate  conversions,
                        especially  if your source video has already been con-
                        verted from its original cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer
                        to  do  motion-compensated  interpolation. FrameFormer
                        uses the best conversion method frame by  frame.  Note
                        that  using FrameFormer increases the transcoding time
                        and incurs a significant add-on cost. When you  choose
                        FrameFormer,  your  input  video resolution must be at
                        least 128x96.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps. Use Framerate-
                        Denominator  to  specify the denominator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use 1001 for the value of Fram-
                        erateDenominator.   When   you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value as a decimal number for Frame rate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        When you use the API for transcode jobs that use frame
                        rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a fraction.
                        For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.  Use  Framer-
                        ateNumerator  to  specify  the numerator of this frac-
                        tion. In this example, use  24000  for  the  value  of
                        FramerateNumerator.  When  you  use  the  console  for
                        transcode jobs that use frame rate conversion, provide
                        the  value  as a decimal number for Framerate. In this
                        example, specify 23.976.

                     Profile -> (string)
                        Specify the XAVC profile for this output. For more in-
                        formation,    see    the    Sony    documentation   at
                        https://www.xavc-info.org/.  Note  that   MediaConvert
                        doesn't  support  the  interlaced video XAVC operating
                        points for XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG. To create an  interlaced
                        XAVC output, choose the profile XAVC_HD.

                     SlowPal -> (string)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your input frame rate is
                        23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps). Enable slow  PAL
                        to  create  a  25  fps  output by relabeling the video
                        frames and resampling your audio. Note  that  enabling
                        this setting will slightly reduce the duration of your
                        video. Related settings: You must also set Frame  rate
                        to 25.

                     Softness -> (integer)
                        Ignore  this  setting  unless your downstream workflow
                        requires that you specify it explicitly. Otherwise, we
                        recommend  that you adjust the softness of your output
                        by using a lower value for the setting Sharpness or by
                        enabling  a noise reducer filter. The Softness setting
                        specifies the quantization matrices that  the  encoder
                        uses.  Keep  the  default value, 0, for flat quantiza-
                        tion. Choose the value 1 or 16 to use the default  JVT
                        softening quantization matricies from the H.264 speci-
                        fication. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use  planar
                        interpolation. Increasing values from 17 to 128 result
                        in increasing reduction of  high-frequency  data.  The
                        value 128 results in the softest video.

                     SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        The  best  way  to  set up adaptive quantization is to
                        keep the default value, Auto, for the setting Adaptive
                        quantization.  When  you do so, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally applies the best types of quantization for  your
                        video  content.  Include this setting in your JSON job
                        specification only when you choose to change  the  de-
                        fault  value  for Adaptive quantization. For this set-
                        ting, keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quan-
                        tization  within each frame based on spatial variation
                        of content complexity. When you enable  this  feature,
                        the  encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain
                        more distortion with no noticeable visual  degradation
                        and uses more bits on areas where any small distortion
                        will be  noticeable.  For  example,  complex  textured
                        blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured
                        blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling this  fea-
                        ture  will  almost  always improve your video quality.
                        Note, though, that this feature doesn't take into  ac-
                        count where the viewer's attention is likely to be. If
                        viewers are likely to be focusing their attention on a
                        part  of the screen with a lot of complex texture, you
                        might choose to disable this feature. Related setting:
                        When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set the
                        value for Adaptive quantization depending on your con-
                        tent.  For  homogeneous  content, such as cartoons and
                        video games, set it to Low. For content with  a  wider
                        variety of textures, set it to High or Higher.

                     TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                        The  best  way  to  set up adaptive quantization is to
                        keep the default value, Auto, for the setting Adaptive
                        quantization.  When  you do so, MediaConvert automati-
                        cally applies the best types of quantization for  your
                        video  content.  Include this setting in your JSON job
                        specification only when you choose to change  the  de-
                        fault  value  for Adaptive quantization. For this set-
                        ting, keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quan-
                        tization within each frame based on temporal variation
                        of content complexity. When you enable  this  feature,
                        the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that
                        aren't moving and uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                        with  sharp  edges  that move a lot. For example, this
                        feature improves the readability of  text  tickers  on
                        newscasts  and scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling
                        this feature will almost  always  improve  your  video
                        quality.  Note, though, that this feature doesn't take
                        into account where the viewer's attention is likely to
                        be.  If viewers are likely to be focusing their atten-

                        FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to
                            keep the default  value,  Auto,  for  the  setting
                            Adaptive  quantization.  When you do so, MediaCon-
                            vert automatically applies the best types of quan-
                            tization for your video content. Include this set-
                            ting in your JSON job specification only when  you
                            choose  to  change  the default value for Adaptive
                            quantization. Enable this setting to have the  en-
                            coder reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop appears as a
                            visual flicker that can  arise  when  the  encoder
                            saves  bits by copying some macroblocks many times
                            from frame to frame, and then  refreshes  them  at
                            the I-frame. When you enable this setting, the en-
                            coder updates these macroblocks slightly more  of-
                            ten  to  smooth  out  the flicker. This setting is
                            disabled by default. Related setting: In  addition
                            to  enabling this setting, you must also set Adap-
                            tive quantization to a value  other  than  Off  or
                            Auto.  Use Adaptive quantization to adjust the de-

                            erence frames for other pictures in the same  GOP.
                            Choose  Allow to allow the encoder to use B-frames
                            as reference frames. Choose Don't allow to prevent
                            the  encoder  from  using  B-frames  as  reference

                            Frequency of closed GOPs.  In  streaming  applica-
                            tions,  it is recommended that this be set to 1 so
                            a decoder joining mid-stream will receive  an  IDR
                            frame  as  quickly as possible. Setting this value
                            to 0 will break output segmenting.

                            uses  in  the  HRD  buffer  model for this output.
                            Specify this value in  bits;  for  example,  enter
                            five  megabits as 5000000. When you don't set this
                            value, or you set it to zero, MediaConvert  calcu-
                            lates  the default by doubling the bitrate of this
                            output point.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality tuning level to  choose  how
                            you  want  to  trade off encoding speed for output
                            video quality. The  default  behavior  is  faster,
                            lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for  pro-
                            gressive  pictures, and less than or equal to half
                            the number of macroblock rows for interlaced  pic-

                        XavcClass -> (string)
                            Specify the XAVC Intra HD (CBG) Class to  set  the
                            bitrate  of your output. Outputs of the same class
                            have similar  image  quality  over  the  operating
                            points that are valid for that class.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use Top field first or Bottom field first to  cre-
                            ate  an  output  that's  interlaced  with the same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or  Follow, default bottom to produce outputs with
                            the same field polarity as the  source.  For  jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity might change over the course  of  the  output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the source is interlaced, the output will  be  in-
                            terlaced  with the same polarity as the source. If
                            the source is progressive, the output will be  in-
                            terlaced  with  top  field bottom field first, de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality tuning level to  choose  how
                            you  want  to  trade off encoding speed for output
                            video quality. The  default  behavior  is  faster,
                            lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                        Slices -> (integer)

                            the number of macroblock rows for interlaced  pic-
                            tures.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting  unless  you  set Frame rate
                            (framerateNumerator divided by  framerateDenomina-
                            tor) to 29.970. If your input framerate is 23.976,
                            choose Hard. Otherwise,  keep  the  default  value
                            None.      For      more      information,     see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-telecine-and-inverse-telecine.html.

              ColorMetadata -> (string)
                 Choose  Insert  for this setting to include color metadata in
                 this output. Choose Ignore to  exclude  color  metadata  from
                 this  output.  If you don't specify a value, the service sets
                 this to Insert by default.

              Crop -> (structure)
                 Use Cropping selection to specify the  video  area  that  the
                 service will include in the output video frame.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even numbers.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even numbers.

                 X -> (integer)
                     The  distance,  in  pixels, between the rectangle and the
                     left edge of the video frame. Specify only even numbers.

                 Y -> (integer)
                     The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle  and  the
                     top edge of the video frame. Specify only even numbers.

              DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                 Applies  only  to 29.97 fps outputs. When this feature is en-
                 abled, the service will use drop-frame timecode  on  outputs.
                 If  it is not possible to use drop-frame timecode, the system
                 will fall back to non-drop-frame. This setting is enabled  by
                 default when Timecode insertion is enabled.

              FixedAfd -> (integer)
                 Applies  only if you set AFD Signaling to Fixed. Use Fixed to
                 specify a four-bit AFD value which the service will write  on
                 all frames of this video output.

              Height -> (integer)
                 Use  Height to define the video resolution height, in pixels,
                 for this output. To use the same resolution  as  your  input:
                 Leave  both Width and Height blank. To evenly scale from your
                 input resolution: Leave Height blank and enter  a  value  for
                 Width.  For  example,  if your input is 1920x1080 and you set
                 Width to 1280, your output will be 1280x720.

              Position -> (structure)
                 Use Selection placement to define the video area in your out-
                 put frame. The area outside of the rectangle that you specify
                 here is black.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even numbers.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even numbers.

                 X -> (integer)
                     The distance, in pixels, between the  rectangle  and  the
                     left edge of the video frame. Specify only even numbers.

                 Y -> (integer)
                     The  distance,  in  pixels, between the rectangle and the
                     top edge of the video frame. Specify only even numbers.

              RespondToAfd -> (string)
                 Use Respond to AFD to specify how  the  service  changes  the
                 video itself in response to AFD values in the input. * Choose
                 Respond to clip the input video frame according  to  the  AFD
                 value,  input display aspect ratio, and output display aspect
                 ratio. * Choose Passthrough to include the input AFD  values.
                 Do  not  choose this when AfdSignaling is set to NONE. A pre-
                 ferred implementation of this workflow is to set RespondToAfd
                 to  and set AfdSignaling to AUTO. * Choose None to remove all
                 input AFD values from this output.

              ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                 Specify the video Scaling behavior when  your  output  has  a
                 different  resolution  than your input. For more information,
                 see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-scaling.html

              Sharpness -> (integer)
                 Use Sharpness setting to specify the strength of  anti-alias-
                 ing.  This setting changes the width of the anti-alias filter
                 kernel used for scaling. Sharpness only applies if your  out-
                 put  resolution is different from your input resolution. 0 is
                 the softest setting, 100 the sharpest, and 50 recommended for
                 most content.

              TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                 Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs. Only
                 enable Timecode insertion when the input frame rate is  iden-
                 tical  to the output frame rate. To include timecodes in this
                 output, set Timecode insertion to  PIC_TIMING_SEI.  To  leave
                 them  out,  set it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the
                 service inserts timecodes in an output, by default,  it  uses
                 any  embedded  timecodes from the input. If none are present,
                 the service will set the timecode for the first output  frame
                 to zero. To change this default behavior, adjust the settings
                 under Timecode configuration. In the console, these  settings
                 are  located  under  Job > Job settings > Timecode configura-
                 tion. Note - Timecode source under input  settings  does  not
                 affect  the timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source
                 under Job settings > Timecode configuration does.

              VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)
                 Find additional transcoding features under Preprocessors. En-
                 able the features at each output individually. These features
                 are disabled by default.

                 ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                     Use these settings to convert the color space or to  mod-
                     ify  properties such as hue and contrast for this output.

                     Brightness -> (integer)
                        Brightness level.

                     ClipLimits -> (structure)
                        Specify YUV limits and RGB  tolerances  when  you  set
                        Sample range conversion to Limited range clip.

                        MaximumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                            Specify  the Maximum RGB color sample range toler-
                            ance for your output.  MediaConvert  corrects  any
                            YUV  values  that, when converted to RGB, would be
                            outside the upper tolerance that you specify.  En-
                            ter  an  integer  from 90 to 105 as an offset per-
                            centage to the maximum possible value. Leave blank
                            to  use  the default value 100. When you specify a
                            value for Maximum RGB tolerance, you must set Sam-
                            ple range conversion to Limited range clip.

                        MaximumYUV -> (integer)
                            Specify the Maximum YUV color sample limit. Media-
                            Convert conforms any pixels in  your  input  above
                            the  value  that  you  specify  to typical limited
                            range bounds. Enter an integer from 920  to  1023.
                            Leave  blank  to  use  the  default value 940. The
                            value that you enter applies to 10-bit ranges. For
                            8-bit  ranges,  MediaConvert  automatically scales
                            this value down. When you specify a value for Max-
                            imum  YUV, you must set Sample range conversion to
                            Limited range clip.

                        MinimumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                            Specify the Minimum RGB color sample range  toler-
                            ance  for  your  output. MediaConvert corrects any
                            YUV values that, when converted to RGB,  would  be
                            outside  the lower tolerance that you specify. En-
                            ter an integer from -5 to 10 as an offset percent-
                            age  to the minimum possible value. Leave blank to
                            use the default value 0. When you specify a  value
                            for  Minimum  RGB  tolerance,  you must set Sample
                            range conversion to Limited range clip.

                        MinimumYUV -> (integer)
                            Specify the Minimum YUV color sample limit. Media-
                            Convert  conforms  any  pixels in your input below
                            the value that  you  specify  to  typical  limited

                            Leave blank to use the default value 64. The value
                            that you enter applies to 10-bit ranges. For 8-bit
                            ranges,  MediaConvert  automatically  scales  this
                            value  down.  When you specify a value for Minumum
                            YUV, you must set Sample range conversion to  Lim-
                            ited range clip.

                     ColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                        Specify  the color space you want for this output. The
                        service supports conversion between HDR  formats,  be-
                        tween  SDR  formats,  from SDR to HDR, and from HDR to
                        SDR. SDR to HDR conversion doesn't upgrade the dynamic
                        range. The converted video has an HDR format, but vis-
                        ually appears the same as an unconverted  output.  HDR
                        to SDR conversion uses tone mapping to approximate the
                        outcome of manually regrading from HDR  to  SDR.  When
                        you  specify  an output color space, MediaConvert uses
                        the following color  space  metadata,  which  includes
                        color  primaries, transfer characteristics, and matrix
                        coefficients: * HDR 10: BT.2020, PQ, BT.2020  non-con-
                        stant * HLG 2020: BT.2020, HLG, BT.2020 non-constant *

                        P3, PQ, BT.709

                     Contrast -> (integer)
                        Contrast level.

                     Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                        Use these settings when you  convert  to  the  HDR  10
                        color  space. Specify the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering Dis-

                        naled  in  the  output.  These values don't affect the
                        pixel values that are encoded  in  the  video  stream.
                        They  are intended to help the downstream video player
                        display content in a way that reflects the  intentions
                        of  the  the content creator. When you set Color space
                        conversion to HDR 10, these settings are required. You
                        must  set values for Max frame average light level and
                        Max content light level; these settings don't  have  a
                        default value. The default values for the other HDR 10
                        metadata settings  are  defined  by  the  P3D65  color
                        space.  For  more  information  about MediaConvert HDR

                        sources, your SDR output may look less bright and less
                        saturated when compared to your HDR source.  MediaCon-
                        vert  automatically applies this mode for HLG sources,
                        regardless of your choice. For a bright and  saturated
                        output:  Choose  Vibrant. We recommend that you choose
                        this mode when any of your source  content  is  HDR10,
                        and  for the best results when it is mastered for 1000
                        nits. You may notice loss of details in bright or sat-
                        urated  areas  of your output. HDR to SDR tone mapping
                        has no effect when your input is SDR.

                     Hue -> (integer)
                        Hue in degrees.

                     SampleRangeConversion -> (string)
                        Specify how MediaConvert limits the color sample range
                        for this output. To create a limited range output from
                        a full range input: Choose Limited range squeeze.  For
                        full range inputs, MediaConvert performs a linear off-
                        set to color samples equally  across  all  pixels  and
                        frames. Color samples in 10-bit outputs are limited to
                        64 through 940, and 8-bit outputs are  limited  to  16
                        through  235.  Note:  For limited range inputs, values
                        for color samples are passed through  to  your  output
                        unchanged.  MediaConvert  does  not  limit  the sample
                        range. To correct pixels in your input that are out of
                        range  or out of gamut: Choose Limited range clip. Use
                        for broadcast applications. MediaConvert conforms  any
                        pixels  outside  of  the values that you specify under
                        Minimum YUV and Maximum YUV to limited  range  bounds.
                        MediaConvert  also  corrects any YUV values that, when
                        converted to RGB, would  be  outside  the  bounds  you
                        specify  under  Minimum  RGB tolerance and Maximum RGB
                        tolerance. With either limited range conversion, Medi-
                        aConvert  writes the sample range metadata in the out-
                        put.

                     Saturation -> (integer)
                        Saturation level.

                     SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                        Specify the reference white level, in nits, for all of
                        your  SDR  inputs.  Use  to  correct brightness levels
                        within HDR10 outputs.  The  following  color  metadata
                        must  be  present  in your SDR input: color primaries,
                        transfer characteristics, and matrix coefficients.  If
                        your  SDR  input has missing color metadata, or if you
                        want to correct input color metadata, manually specify
                        a  color  space in the input video selector. For 1,000
                        nit peak brightness displays, we  recommend  that  you
                        set  SDR  reference  white  level to 203 (according to
                        ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank to use the  default  value
                        of 100, or specify an integer from 100 to 1000.

                 Deinterlacer -> (structure)
                     Use  the  deinterlacer  to  produce smoother motion and a
                     clearer    picture.    For    more    information,    see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-scan-type.html.

                     Algorithm -> (string)
                        Only applies when you set Deinterlace mode to Deinter-
                        lace  or  Adaptive.  Interpolate produces sharper pic-
                        tures, while blend produces smoother motion.  If  your
                        source  file  includes  a  ticker, such as a scrolling
                        headline at the bottom of the frame:  Choose  Interpo-
                        late  ticker or Blend ticker. To apply field doubling:
                        Choose Linear interpolation. Note that Linear interpo-
                        lation may introduce video artifacts into your output.

                     Control -> (string)

                        o When  set to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer does
                          not convert frames that are tagged  in  metadata  as
                          progressive.  It  will  only  convert those that are
                          tagged  as  some  other  type.   -   When   set   to
                          FORCE_ALL_FRAMES,  the  deinterlacer  converts every
                          frame to progressive - even those that  are  already
                          tagged  as  progressive.  Turn Force mode on only if
                          there is a good chance that the metadata has  tagged
                          frames as progressive when they are not progressive.
                          Do not turn on otherwise; processing frames that are
                          already  progressive  into progressive will probably
                          result in lower quality video.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        Use Deinterlacer to choose how  the  service  will  do
                        deinterlacing.  Default  is Deinterlace. - Deinterlace
                        converts interlaced to progressive. - Inverse telecine
                        converts  Hard Telecine 29.97i to progressive 23.976p.
                        - Adaptive auto-detects and converts to progressive.

                 DolbyVision -> (structure)
                     Enable Dolby Vision feature to produce Dolby Vision  com-
                     patible video output.

                     L6Metadata -> (structure)
                        Use  these settings when you set DolbyVisionLevel6Mode
                        to SPECIFY to override the MaxCLL and  MaxFALL  values
                        in your input with new values.

                        MaxCll -> (integer)
                            Maximum  Content  Light Level. Static HDR metadata
                            that corresponds to the brightest pixel in the en-
                            tire stream. Measured in nits.

                        MaxFall -> (integer)
                            Maximum  Frame-Average  Light  Level.  Static  HDR
                            metadata that corresponds to the highest frame-av-
                            erage brightness in the entire stream. Measured in
                            nits.

                     L6Mode -> (string)
                        Use Dolby Vision Mode to choose how the  service  will
                        handle Dolby Vision MaxCLL and MaxFALL properies.

                     Mapping -> (string)
                        Required  when you set Dolby Vision Profile to Profile
                        8.1. When you set Content  mapping  to  None,  content
                        mapping is not applied to the HDR10-compatible signal.
                        Depending on the source peak nit level, clipping might
                        occur  on  HDR  devices without Dolby Vision. When you
                        set Content mapping to HDR10 1000, the transcoder cre-
                        ates  a 1,000 nits peak HDR10-compatible signal by ap-
                        plying static content mapping to the source. This mode
                        is speed-optimized for PQ10 sources with metadata that
                        is created from analysis. For graded Dolby Vision con-
                        tent, be aware that creative intent might not be guar-
                        anteed with extreme 1,000 nits trims.

                     Profile -> (string)
                        Required when you enable Dolby Vision. Use  Profile  5
                        to  include frame-interleaved Dolby Vision metadata in
                        your output. Your  input  must  include  Dolby  Vision
                        metadata  or an HDR10 YUV color space. Use Profile 8.1
                        to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vision metadata and
                        HDR10 metadata in your output. Your input must include
                        Dolby Vision metadata.

                 Hdr10Plus -> (structure)
                     Enable HDR10+ analysis and metadata injection. Compatible
                     with HEVC only.

                     MasteringMonitorNits -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  HDR10+ mastering display normalized peak
                        luminance, in nits. This is the normalized actual peak
                        luminance  of  the mastering display, as defined by ST
                        2094-40.

                     TargetMonitorNits -> (integer)
                        Specify the HDR10+ target display nominal  peak  lumi-
                        nance,  in nits. This is the nominal maximum luminance
                        of the target display as defined by ST 2094-40.

                 ImageInserter -> (structure)
                     Enable the Image inserter feature to  include  a  graphic
                     overlay on your video. Enable or disable this feature for
                     each output individually. This setting is disabled by de-
                     fault.

                     InsertableImages -> (list)
                        Specify  the  images  that you want to overlay on your
                        video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                        (structure)
                            These settings apply to a specific  graphic  over-
                            lay.  You  can  include  multiple overlays in your
                            job.

                            Duration -> (integer)
                               Specify the time, in milliseconds, for the  im-
                               age  to  remain on the output video. This dura-
                               tion includes fade-in  time  but  not  fade-out
                               time.

                            FadeIn -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length  of time, in milliseconds,
                               between the Start time that you specify for the
                               image insertion and the time that the image ap-
                               pears at full  opacity.  Full  opacity  is  the
                               level that you specify for the opacity setting.
                               If you don't specify a value for  Fade-in,  the
                               image will appear abruptly at the overlay start
                               time.

                            FadeOut -> (integer)
                               Specify the length of  time,  in  milliseconds,
                               between the end of the time that you have spec-
                               ified for the image overlay Duration  and  when
                               the overlaid image has faded to total transpar-
                               ency.  If  you  don't  specify  a   value   for
                               Fade-out,  the image will disappear abruptly at
                               the end of the inserted image duration.

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Specify the height of  the  inserted  image  in
                               pixels.  If  you  specify a value that's larger
                               than the video resolution height,  the  service
                               will  crop  your  overlaid image to fit. To use
                               the native height of the image, keep this  set-
                               ting blank.

                            ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                               Specify  the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 location
                               of the image that you want to  overlay  on  the
                               video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                            ImageX -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between the
                               inserted image and the left edge of  the  video
                               frame.  Required for any image overlay that you
                               specify.

                            ImageY -> (integer)
                               Specify the distance, in  pixels,  between  the
                               overlaid  image  and  the top edge of the video
                               frame. Required for any image overlay that  you
                               specify.

                            Layer -> (integer)
                               Specify how overlapping inserted images appear.
                               Images with higher values for Layer  appear  on
                               top of images with lower values for Layer.

                            Opacity -> (integer)
                               Use Opacity to specify how much of the underly-
                               ing video shows through the inserted  image.  0
                               is transparent and 100 is fully opaque. Default
                               is 50.

                            StartTime -> (string)
                               Specify the timecode of the frame that you want
                               the overlay to first appear on. This must be in
                               timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF or  HH:MM:SS;FF)  format.
                               Remember  to  take  into  account your timecode
                               source settings.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Specify the width of the inserted image in pix-
                               els.  If you specify a value that's larger than
                               the video resolution width,  the  service  will
                               crop your overlaid image to fit. To use the na-
                               tive width of  the  image,  keep  this  setting
                               blank.

                     SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                        Specify the reference white level, in nits, for all of
                        your image inserter images. Use to correct  brightness
                        levels  within  HDR10  outputs.  For  1,000  nit  peak
                        brightness displays, we recommend  that  you  set  SDR
                        reference  white  level  to  203  (according  to ITU-R
                        BT.2408). Leave blank to use the default value of 100,
                        or specify an integer from 100 to 1000.

                 NoiseReducer -> (structure)
                     Enable  the  Noise  reducer  feature to remove noise from
                     your video output if necessary. Enable  or  disable  this
                     feature  for  each  output  individually. This setting is
                     disabled by default. When you enable Noise  reducer,  you
                     must  also  select  a value for Noise reducer filter. For
                     AVC outputs, when you include Noise reducer,  you  cannot
                     include the Bandwidth reduction filter.

                     Filter -> (string)
                        Use  Noise reducer filter to select one of the follow-
                        ing spatial image filtering  functions.  To  use  this
                        setting,  you must also enable Noise reducer. * Bilat-
                        eral preserves edges  while  reducing  noise.  *  Mean
                        (softest),  Gaussian,  Lanczos, and Sharpen (sharpest)
                        do convolution  filtering.  *  Conserve  does  min/max
                        noise  reduction. * Spatial does frequency-domain fil-
                        tering based on JND principles. *  Temporal  optimizes
                        video quality for complex motion.

                     FilterSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for a noise reducer filter

                        Strength -> (integer)
                            Relative strength of noise reducing filter. Higher
                            values produce stronger filtering.

                     SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)
                        Noise reducer filter settings for spatial filter.

                        PostFilterSharpenStrength -> (integer)
                            Specify strength of post noise reduction  sharpen-
                            ing  filter, with 0 disabling the filter and 3 en-
                            abling it at maximum strength.

                        Speed -> (integer)
                            The speed of the filter, from -2 (lower speed)  to
                            3 (higher speed), with 0 being the nominal value.

                        Strength -> (integer)
                            Relative strength of noise reducing filter. Higher
                            values produce stronger filtering.

                     TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                        Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.

                        AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                            Use Aggressive mode for content that  has  complex
                            motion.  Higher  values  produce stronger temporal
                            filtering. This filters highly complex scenes more
                            aggressively and creates better VQ for low bitrate
                            outputs.

                        PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                            When you set Noise reducer to Temporal, the  band-
                            width and sharpness of your output is reduced. You
                            can optionally use Post temporal sharpening to ap-
                            ply  sharpening  to the edges of your output. Note
                            that Post temporal sharpening will also  make  the
                            bandwidth   reduction   from   the  Noise  reducer
                            smaller. The default behavior,  Auto,  allows  the
                            transcoder  to determine whether to apply sharpen-
                            ing, depending on your  input  type  and  quality.
                            When  you set Post temporal sharpening to Enabled,
                            specify how much sharpening is applied using  Post
                            temporal  sharpening  strength.  Set Post temporal
                            sharpening to Disabled to not apply sharpening.

                        PostTemporalSharpeningStrength -> (string)
                            Use Post temporal sharpening  strength  to  define
                            the amount of sharpening the transcoder applies to
                            your output. Set Post temporal sharpening strength
                            to  Low, Medium, or High to indicate the amount of
                            sharpening.

                        Speed -> (integer)
                            The speed of the filter (higher number is faster).
                            Low  setting  reduces  bit  rate  at  the  cost of
                            transcode time, high  setting  improves  transcode
                            time at the cost of bit rate.

                        Strength -> (integer)
                            Specify  the strength of the noise reducing filter
                            on this output.  Higher  values  produce  stronger
                            filtering.   We   recommend  the  following  value
                            ranges, depending on the result that you  want:  *
                            0-2  for  complexity reduction with minimal sharp-
                            ness loss * 2-8 for complexity reduction with  im-
                            age  preservation  * 8-16 for a high level of com-
                            plexity reduction

                 PartnerWatermarking -> (structure)
                     If you work with a third party video  watermarking  part-
                     ner,  use the group of settings that correspond with your
                     watermarking partner to include watermarks in  your  out-
                     put.

                     NexguardFileMarkerSettings -> (structure)
                        For forensic video watermarking, MediaConvert supports
                        Nagra NexGuard File Marker watermarking.  MediaConvert
                        supports  both  PreRelease  Content  (NGPR/G2) and OTT
                        Streaming workflows.

                        License -> (string)
                            Use the base64 license string that Nagra  provides
                            you. Enter it directly in your JSON job specifica-
                            tion or in the console. Required when you  include
                            Nagra  NexGuard  File  Marker watermarking in your
                            job.

                        Payload -> (integer)
                            Specify the payload ID that  you  want  associated
                            with  this  output. Valid values vary depending on
                            your Nagra NexGuard  forensic  watermarking  work-
                            flow.  Required  when  you  include Nagra NexGuard
                            File Marker watermarking in your job.  For  PreRe-
                            lease Content (NGPR/G2), specify an integer from 1
                            through 4,194,303. You must generate a  unique  ID
                            for each asset you watermark, and keep a record of
                            which ID you have assigned to each asset.  Neither
                            Nagra nor MediaConvert keep track of the relation-
                            ship between output files and your  IDs.  For  OTT
                            Streaming,   create  two  adaptive  bitrate  (ABR)
                            stacks for each asset. Do this by setting  up  two
                            output groups. For one output group, set the value
                            of Payload ID to 0 in every output. For the  other
                            output group, set Payload ID to 1 in every output.

                        Preset -> (string)
                            Enter  one of the watermarking preset strings that
                            Nagra provides you. Required when you include  Na-
                            gra NexGuard File Marker watermarking in your job.

                        Strength -> (string)
                            Optional. Ignore this setting unless Nagra support
                            directs you to specify a  value.  When  you  don't
                            specify  a  value here, the Nagra NexGuard library
                            uses its default value.

                 TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                     Settings for burning the output  timecode  and  specified
                     prefix into the output.

                     FontSize -> (integer)
                        Use  Font  size  to set the font size of any burned-in
                        timecode. Valid values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                     Position -> (string)
                        Use Position under Timecode burn-in to specify the lo-
                        cation the burned-in timecode on output video.

                     Prefix -> (string)
                        Use  Prefix  to  place  ASCII  characters  before  any
                        burned-in timecode. For example,  a  prefix  of  "EZ-"
                        will  result in the timecode "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide
                        either the characters themselves  or  the  ASCII  code
                        equivalents. The supported range of characters is 0x20
                        through 0x7e. This includes letters, numbers, and  all
                        special  characters  represented on a standard English
                        keyboard.

              Width -> (integer)
                 Use Width to define the video resolution  width,  in  pixels,
                 for  this  output.  To use the same resolution as your input:
                 Leave both Width and Height blank. To evenly scale from  your
                 input  resolution:  Leave  Width  blank and enter a value for
                 Height. For example, if your input is 1920x1080 and  you  set
                 Height to 720, your output will be 1280x720.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To change a preset

       The  following  update-preset  example replaces the description for the
       specified preset.

                 aws mediaconvert update-preset \
                 --name Customer1 \
                 --description "New description text."
                 --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

       This command produces no output.  Output:

          {
              "Preset": {
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:us-east-1:003235472598:presets/SimpleMP4",
                  "Settings": {
                  ...<output settings removed for brevity>...
                  },

              AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                 Contains groups of audio encoding settings organized by audio
                 codec. Include one instance of per output. Can contain multi-
                 ple groups of encoding settings.

                 (structure)
                     Settings  related  to  one  audio tab on the MediaConvert
                     console. In your job JSON, an instance  of  AudioDescrip-
                     tion  is equivalent to one audio tab in the console. Usu-
                     ally, one audio  tab  corresponds  to  one  output  audio
                     track.  Depending  on how you set up your input audio se-
                     lectors and whether you use audio  selector  groups,  one
                     audio  tab  can  correspond  to  a  group of output audio
                     tracks.

                     AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                        Specify the QuickTime audio channel  layout  tags  for
                        the audio channels in this audio track. When you don't
                        specify a value, MediaConvert  labels  your  track  as
                        Center  (C)  by  default. To use Audio layout tagging,
                        your output must be in a QuickTime (MOV) container and
                        your audio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF.

                        ChannelTag -> (string)
                            Specify  the  QuickTime  audio channel layout tags
                            for the audio channels in this audio track.  Enter
                            channel layout tags in the same order as your out-
                            put's audio channel order. For  example,  if  your
                            output audio track has a left and a right channel,
                            enter Left (L) for the first channel and Right (R)
                            for  the  second. If your output has multiple sin-
                            gle-channel audio tracks, enter a  single  channel
                            layout tag for each track.

                        ChannelTags -> (list)
                            Specify  the  QuickTime  audio channel layout tags

                               tracks,  enter  a single channel layout tag for
                               each track.

                     AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                        Advanced audio normalization  settings.  Ignore  these
                        settings  unless  you  need  to comply with a loudness
                        standard.

                        Algorithm -> (string)
                            Choose one of the  following  audio  normalization
                            algorithms:  ITU-R  BS.1770-1: Ungated loudness. A
                            measurement of ungated average loudness for an en-
                            tire piece of content, suitable for measurement of
                            short-form content under ATSC recommendation A/85.
                            Supports   up   to   5.1   audio  channels.  ITU-R
                            BS.1770-2: Gated loudness. A measurement of  gated
                            average  loudness  compliant with the requirements
                            of EBU-R128. Supports up to  5.1  audio  channels.
                            ITU-R  BS.1770-3: Modified peak. The same loudness
                            measurement algorithm as 1770-2, with  an  updated
                            true  peak  measurement.  ITU-R  BS.1770-4: Higher
                            channel count. Allows for more audio channels than
                            the  other  algorithms,  including  configurations
                            such as 7.1.

                        AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                            When enabled the output audio is  corrected  using
                            the  chosen algorithm. If disabled, the audio will
                            be measured but not adjusted.

                        CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                            Content measuring above this level  will  be  cor-
                            rected  to the target level. Content measuring be-
                            low this level will not be corrected.

                        LoudnessLogging -> (string)
                            If set to LOG, log each output's audio track loud-
                            ness to a CSV file.

                        PeakCalculation -> (string)
                            If  set  to TRUE_PEAK, calculate and log the True-
                            Peak for each output's audio track loudness.

                        TargetLkfs -> (double)
                            When you use Audio normalization,  optionally  use
                            this  setting to specify a target loudness. If you
                            don't specify a value here, the encoder chooses  a
                            value  for  you,  based  on the algorithm that you
                            choose for  Algorithm.  If  you  choose  algorithm
                            1770-1,  the  encoder will choose -24 LKFS; other-
                            wise, the encoder will choose -23 LKFS.

                        TruePeakLimiterThreshold -> (double)
                            Specify the True-peak limiter threshold  in  deci-
                            bels  relative  to full scale (dBFS). The peak in-
                            ter-audio sample loudness in your output  will  be
                            limited to the value that you specify, without af-
                            fecting the overall target  LKFS.  Enter  a  value
                            from 0 to -8. Leave blank to use the default value
                            0.

                     AudioSourceName -> (string)
                        Specifies which audio data to use from each input.  In
                        the  simplest  case,  specify an "Audio Selector":#in-
                        puts-audio_selector by name based on its order  within
                        each input. For example if you specify "Audio Selector
                        3", then the third audio selector will  be  used  from
                        each input. If an input does not have an "Audio Selec-
                        tor 3", then the audio selector marked as "default" in
                        that input will be used. If there is no audio selector
                        marked as "default", silence will be inserted for  the
                        duration  of  that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Se-
                        lector Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group name may be
                        specified,  with  similar default/silence behavior. If
                        no audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio  Selec-
                        tor 1" will be chosen automatically.

                     AudioType -> (integer)
                        Applies  only  if Follow Input Audio Type is unchecked
                        (false). A number between 0 and 255. The following are
                        defined  in  ISO-IEC 13818-1: 0 = Undefined, 1 = Clean
                        Effects, 2 = Hearing Impaired, 3 =  Visually  Impaired
                        Commentary, 4-255 = Reserved.

                     AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                        When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input contains an ISO
                        639 audio_type, then that value is passed  through  to
                        the  output.  If  the  input  contains  no ISO 639 au-
                        dio_type, the value in Audio Type is included  in  the
                        output.  Otherwise the value in Audio Type is included
                        in the output. Note that this field and audioType  are
                        both  ignored if audioDescriptionBroadcasterMix is set
                        to BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD.

                     CodecSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to audio encoding.  The  settings  in
                        this group vary depending on the value that you choose
                        for your audio codec.

                        AacSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set Codec to the value AAC.  The
                            service  accepts  one  of  two  mutually exclusive
                            groups of AAC settings--VBR and CBR. To select one
                            of  these  modes, set the value of Bitrate control
                            mode to "VBR" or "CBR". In VBR mode,  you  control
                            the audio quality with the setting VBR quality. In
                            CBR mode, you use the  setting  Bitrate.  Defaults
                            and valid values depend on the rate control mode.

                            AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)
                               Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input con-
                               tains pre-mixed main audio + audio  description
                               (AD)  as a stereo pair. The value for AudioType
                               will be set to 3, which signals  to  downstream
                               systems  that this stream contains "broadcaster
                               mixed AD". Note that the input received by  the
                               encoder  must  contain pre-mixed audio; the en-
                               coder does not perform  the  mixing.  When  you
                               choose  BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD,  the  encoder ig-
                               nores any values you provide in  AudioType  and
                               FollowInputAudioType.  Choose  NORMAL  when the
                               input does not contain pre-mixed audio +  audio
                               description  (AD).  In  this  case, the encoder
                               will use any values you provide  for  AudioType
                               and FollowInputAudioType.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               The set of valid values for  this  setting  is:
                               6000,  8000, 10000, 12000, 14000, 16000, 20000,
                               24000,  28000,  32000,  40000,  48000,   56000,
                               64000,  80000,  96000,  112000, 128000, 160000,
                               192000, 224000, 256000, 288000, 320000, 384000,
                               448000, 512000, 576000, 640000, 768000, 896000,
                               1024000. The value you set is also  constrained
                               by  the values that you choose for Profile, Bi-
                               trate control mode, and  Sample  rate.  Default
                               values  depend on Bitrate control mode and Pro-
                               file.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               AAC Profile.

                            CodingMode -> (string)
                               The Coding mode that you specify determines the
                               number  of audio channels and the audio channel
                               layout metadata in your AAC output. Valid  cod-
                               ing  modes  depend on the Rate control mode and
                               Profile that you  select.  The  following  list
                               shows  the number of audio channels and channel
                               layout for each coding mode. *  1.0  Audio  De-

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Rate Control Mode.

                            RawFormat -> (string)
                               Enables LATM/LOAS AAC output. Note that if  you
                               use LATM/LOAS AAC in an output, you must choose
                               "No container" for the output container.

                            SampleRate -> (integer)
                               Specify the Sample rate  in  Hz.  Valid  sample

                               we recommend that  you  use  the  mode-specific
                               settings  instead  of Dynamic range compression
                               profile. The mode-specific settings are Dynamic
                               range  compression  profile,  line mode and Dy-
                               namic range compression profile, RF mode.  Note
                               that when you specify values for all three set-
                               tings, MediaConvert ignores the value  of  this
                               setting in favor of the mode-specific settings.
                               If you do  use  this  setting  instead  of  the
                               mode-specific  settings,  choose  None to leave
                               out DRC signaling. Keep the default Film  stan-

                               that supplied this audio data. If audio was not
                               supplied from one of these  streams,  then  the
                               static metadata settings will be used.

                               the transcode. Inputs  that  alternate  between
                               DD+  and non-DD+ content will have a consistent
                               DD+ output as  the  system  alternates  between
                               passthrough and encoding.

                        track when you set Language code control to  Use  con-
                        figured.  The  service also uses your specified custom
                        language code when you set Language  code  control  to
                        Follow  input,  but  your input file doesn't specify a
                        language code. For all outputs, you  can  use  an  ISO
                        639-2  or  ISO  639-3 code. For streaming outputs, you
                        can also use any other code in the full RFC-5646 spec-
                        ification. Streaming outputs are those that are in one
                        of the following output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO,  Apple

                     RemixSettings -> (structure)
                        Advanced audio remixing settings.

                        ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                            Channel  mapping contains the group of fields that
                            hold the remixing value for each channel,  in  dB.
                            Specify  remix  values to indicate how much of the
                            content from your input audio channel you want  in
                            your  output  audio channels. Each instance of the
                            InputChannels or InputChannelsFineTune array spec-
                            ifies these values for one output channel. Use one
                            instance of this array for each output channel. In
                            the console, each array corresponds to a column in
                            the graphical depiction of the mapping matrix. The
                            rows  of  the graphical matrix correspond to input
                            channels. Valid values are within the  range  from
                            -60  (mute)  through  6. A setting of 0 passes the
                            input channel unchanged to the output channel  (no
                            attenuation  or  amplification). Use InputChannels
                            or InputChannelsFineTune  to  specify  your  remix
                            values. Don't use both.

                            OutputChannels -> (list)
                               In  your  JSON  job  specification, include one
                               child of OutputChannels for each audio  channel
                               that you want in your output. Each child should
                               contain one instance of  InputChannels  or  In-
                               putChannelsFineTune.

                                      Use  this  setting to specify your remix
                                      values when they are integers,  such  as
                                      -10, 0, or 4.

                                      Use  this  setting to specify your remix
                                      values when they have a  decimal  compo-
                                      nent, such as -10.312, 0.08, or 4.9. Me-
                                      diaConvert rounds your  remixing  values
                                      to the nearest thousandth.

                                      (double)

                        ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of audio channels from your in-
                            put that you want to  use  in  your  output.  With
                            remixing,  you  might combine or split the data in
                            these channels, so the number of channels in  your
                            final  output might be different. If you are doing
                            both input channel mapping and output channel map-
                            ping,  the number of output channels in your input
                            mapping must be the same as the  number  of  input
                            channels in your output mapping.

                        ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                            Specify  the number of channels in this output af-
                            ter remixing. Valid values: 1, 2, 4, 6,  8...  64.
                            (1  and even numbers to 64.) If you are doing both
                            input channel mapping and output channel  mapping,
                            the  number  of output channels in your input map-
                            ping must be the same as the number of input chan-
                            nels in your output mapping.

                     StreamName -> (string)
                        Specify  a label for this output audio stream. For ex-
                        ample, "English", "Director commentary", or "track_2".
                        For streaming outputs, MediaConvert passes this infor-
                        mation into destination manifests for display  on  the
                        end-viewer's  player device. For outputs in other out-
                        put groups, the service ignores this setting.

              CaptionDescriptions -> (list)
                 This object holds groups of settings related to captions  for
                 one  output.  For  each output that has captions, include one
                 instance of CaptionDescriptions.

                     Caption Description for preset

                     CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                        Specify the language for this captions  output  track.
                        For  most  captions  output  formats, the encoder puts
                        this language information in the output captions meta-
                        data.  If  your  output  captions format is DVB-Sub or
                        Burn in, the encoder uses  this  language  information
                        when  automatically selecting the font script for ren-
                        dering the captions text. For all outputs, you can use
                        an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code. For streaming outputs,
                        you can also use any other code in the  full  RFC-5646
                        specification. Streaming outputs are those that are in
                        one of the following output groups:  CMAF,  DASH  ISO,
                        Apple HLS, or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                     DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  related to one captions tab on the MediaCon-
                        vert console. Usually, one captions tab corresponds to
                        one  output  captions  track. Depending on your output
                        captions format, one tab might correspond to a set  of
                        output  captions  tracks.  For  more  information, see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/including-captions.html.

                        BurninDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Burn-in is a captions delivery method, rather than
                            a captions format. Burn-in writes the captions di-
                            rectly  on  your video frames, replacing pixels of
                            video content with the captions.  Set  up  burn-in
                            captions  in  the  same  output as your video. For
                            more               information,                see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/burn-in-output-captions.html.

                            Alignment -> (string)
                               Specify the alignment of your captions.  If  no
                               explicit x_position is provided, setting align-
                               ment to centered will placethe captions at  the
                               bottom center of the output. Similarly, setting
                               a left alignment willalign captions to the bot-
                               tom  left  of  the output. If x and y positions
                               are given in conjunction with the alignment pa-
                               rameter,  the  font  will  be justified (either
                               left or centered)  relative  to  those  coordi-
                               nates.

                            ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting unless Style passthrough is
                               set to Enabled and Font  color  set  to  Black,
                               Yellow,  Red,  Green,  Blue,  or Hex. Use Apply
                               font color for additional font color  controls.
                               When  you  choose  White  text  only,  or leave
                               blank, your font color setting only applies  to
                               white text in your input captions. For example,
                               if your font color setting is Yellow, and  your
                               input  captions  have  red and white text, your
                               output captions will have red and yellow  text.
                               When  you choose ALL_TEXT, your font color set-
                               ting applies to all  of  your  output  captions
                               text.

                            BackgroundColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color of the rectangle behind the
                               captions. Leave background color blank and  set
                               Style  passthrough  to enabled to use the back-
                               ground color data from your input captions,  if
                               present.

                            BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity of the background rectan-
                               gle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where  0  is
                               transparent   and   255  is  opaque.  If  Style
                               passthrough is set to enabled, leave  blank  to
                               pass  through  the background style information
                               in your input captions to your output captions.
                               If  Style passthrough is set to disabled, leave
                               blank to use a value of 0 and remove all  back-
                               grounds from your output captions.

                            FallbackFont -> (string)
                               Specify  the  font that you want the service to
                               use for your burn in captions when  your  input
                               captions   specify  a  font  that  MediaConvert
                               doesn't support. When you set Fallback font  to
                               best match, or leave blank, MediaConvert uses a
                               supported font that most  closely  matches  the
                               font  that  your  input  captions specify. When
                               there are multiple unsupported  fonts  in  your
                               input  captions, MediaConvert matches each font
                               with the supported font that matches best. When
                               you explicitly choose a replacement font, Medi-
                               aConvert uses that font to replace  all  unsup-
                               ported fonts from your input.

                            FontColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color  of  the burned-in captions
                               text. Leave Font  color  blank  and  set  Style
                               passthrough  to  enabled  to use the font color
                               data from your input captions, if present.

                            FontOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify the opacity of the burned-in  captions.
                               255 is opaque; 0 is transparent.

                            FontResolution -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  Font  resolution in DPI (dots per
                               inch).

                            FontScript -> (string)
                               Set Font script to Automatically determined, or
                               leave  blank,  to  automatically  determine the
                               font script in your input captions.  Otherwise,
                               set to Simplified Chinese (HANS) or Traditional
                               Chinese (HANT) if your input font  script  uses
                               Simplified or Traditional Chinese.

                            FontSize -> (integer)
                               Specify the Font size in pixels. Must be a pos-
                               itive integer. Set to 0, or  leave  blank,  for
                               automatic font size.

                            HexFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting unless your Font color is
                               set to Hex. Enter either six or eight hexideci-
                               mal  digits, representing red, green, and blue,
                               with two optional extra digits for  alpha.  For
                               example  a  value of 1122AABB is a red value of
                               0x11, a green value of 0x22, a  blue  value  of
                               0xAA, and an alpha value of 0xBB.

                            OutlineColor -> (string)
                               Specify font outline color. Leave Outline color
                               blank and set Style passthrough to  enabled  to
                               use the font outline color data from your input
                               captions, if present.

                            OutlineSize -> (integer)
                               Specify the Outline size of the  caption  text,
                               in  pixels.  Leave  Outline  size blank and set
                               Style passthrough to enabled to use the outline
                               size data from your input captions, if present.

                            ShadowColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color  of  the shadow cast by the
                               captions. Leave  Shadow  color  blank  and  set
                               Style  passthrough to enabled to use the shadow
                               color  data  from  your  input   captions,   if
                               present.

                            ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity  of  the  shadow. Enter a
                               value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent and
                               255  is  opaque. If Style passthrough is set to
                               Enabled, leave Shadow  opacity  blank  to  pass
                               through  the  shadow  style information in your
                               input captions  to  your  output  captions.  If
                               Style  passthrough  is  set  to disabled, leave
                               blank to use a value of 0 and remove all  shad-
                               ows from your output captions.

                            ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  horizontal  offset of the shadow,
                               relative to the captions in pixels. A value  of
                               -2  would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels to
                               the left.

                            ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                               Specify the vertical offset of the shadow rela-
                               tive  to  the captions in pixels. A value of -2
                               would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels  above
                               the  text.  Leave Shadow y-offset blank and set
                               Style passthrough to enabled to use the  shadow
                               y-offset  data  from  your  input  captions, if
                               present.

                            StylePassthrough -> (string)
                               Set Style passthrough to  ENABLED  to  use  the
                               available  style,  color, and position informa-
                               tion from  your  input  captions.  MediaConvert
                               uses default settings for any missing style and
                               position information in  your  input  captions.
                               Set  Style  passthrough  to  DISABLED, or leave
                               blank, to ignore the style and position  infor-
                               mation from your input captions and use default
                               settings: white text with black outlining, bot-
                               tom-center  positioning,  and automatic sizing.
                               Whether you set Style passthrough to enabled or
                               not,  you  can also choose to manually override
                               any of the individual style and  position  set-
                               tings.

                            TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  the text spacing in your cap-
                               tions is set by the captions  grid,  or  varies
                               depending on letter width. Choose fixed grid to
                               conform to the spacing specified  in  the  cap-
                               tions file more accurately. Choose proportional
                               to make the text easier to read for closed cap-
                               tions.

                            XPosition -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  horizontal  position  of the cap-
                               tions, relative to the left side of the  output
                               in  pixels.  A  value of 10 would result in the
                               captions starting 10 pixels from  the  left  of
                               the  output.  If no explicit x_position is pro-
                               vided, the horizontal caption position will  be
                               determined by the alignment parameter.

                            YPosition -> (integer)
                               Specify  the vertical position of the captions,
                               relative to the top of the output in pixels.  A
                               value of 10 would result in the captions start-
                               ing 10 pixels from the top of the output. If no
                               explicit  y_position  is  provided, the caption
                               will be positioned towards the  bottom  of  the
                               output.

                        DestinationType -> (string)
                            Specify  the  format  for  this set of captions on
                            this output. The default format is embedded  with-
                            out SCTE-20. Note that your choice of video output
                            container constrains your choice  of  output  cap-
                            tions    format.   For   more   information,   see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html.
                            If you are using SCTE-20 and you want to create an
                            output that complies with the SCTE-43 spec, choose
                            SCTE-20  plus  embedded. To create a non-compliant
                            output where the  embedded  captions  come  first,
                            choose Embedded plus SCTE-20.

                        DvbSubDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to  DVB-Sub  captions.  Set  up
                            DVB-Sub captions in the same output as your video.
                            For          more         information,         see

                            Alignment -> (string)
                               Specify  the  alignment of your captions. If no
                               explicit x_position is provided, setting align-
                               ment  to centered will placethe captions at the
                               bottom center of the output. Similarly, setting
                               a left alignment willalign captions to the bot-
                               tom left of the output. If x  and  y  positions
                               are given in conjunction with the alignment pa-
                               rameter, the font  will  be  justified  (either
                               left  or  centered)  relative  to those coordi-
                               nates. Within your job settings,  all  of  your
                               DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                            ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting unless Style Passthrough is
                               set to Enabled and Font  color  set  to  Black,
                               Yellow,  Red,  Green,  Blue,  or Hex. Use Apply
                               font color for additional font color  controls.
                               When  you  choose  White  text  only,  or leave
                               blank, your font color setting only applies  to
                               white text in your input captions. For example,
                               if your font color setting is Yellow, and  your
                               input  captions  have  red and white text, your
                               output captions will have red and yellow  text.
                               When  you choose ALL_TEXT, your font color set-
                               ting applies to all  of  your  output  captions
                               text.

                            BackgroundColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color of the rectangle behind the
                               captions. Leave background color blank and  set
                               Style  passthrough  to enabled to use the back-
                               ground color data from your input captions,  if
                               present.

                            BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity of the background rectan-
                               gle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where  0  is
                               transparent   and   255  is  opaque.  If  Style
                               passthrough is set to enabled, leave  blank  to
                               pass  through  the background style information
                               in your input captions to your output captions.
                               If  Style passthrough is set to disabled, leave
                               blank to use a value of 0 and remove all  back-
                               grounds  from your output captions. Within your
                               job settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must
                               be identical.

                            DdsHandling -> (string)
                               Specify  how  MediaConvert  handles the display
                               definition segment (DDS). To  exclude  the  DDS
                               from  this  set  of captions: Keep the default,
                               None. To include  the  DDS:  Choose  Specified.
                               When  you  do,  also specify the offset coordi-
                               nates of the display window with DDS  x-coordi-
                               nate  and DDS y-coordinate. To include the DDS,
                               but not include display window data: Choose  No
                               display  window. When you do, you can write po-
                               sition metadata to the page composition segment
                               (PCS)  with  DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordi-
                               nate. For video resolutions with  a  height  of
                               576  pixels  or  less, MediaConvert doesn't in-
                               clude the DDS,  regardless  of  the  value  you
                               choose   for  DDS  handling.  All  burn-in  and
                               DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                            DdsXCoordinate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting, along with DDS  y-coordinate,
                               to specify the upper left corner of the display
                               definition segment (DDS) display  window.  With
                               this  setting, specify the distance, in pixels,
                               between the left side of the frame and the left
                               side  of  the  DDS display window. Keep the de-
                               fault value, 0, to have MediaConvert  automati-
                               cally choose this offset. Related setting: When
                               you use this setting, you must set DDS handling
                               to  a  value other than None. MediaConvert uses
                               these values to determine whether to write page
                               position  data to the DDS or to the page compo-
                               sition segment. All burn-in  and  DVB-Sub  font
                               settings must match.

                            DdsYCoordinate -> (integer)
                               Use  this setting, along with DDS x-coordinate,
                               to specify the upper left corner of the display
                               definition  segment  (DDS) display window. With
                               this setting, specify the distance, in  pixels,
                               between the top of the frame and the top of the
                               DDS display window. Keep the default value,  0,
                               to  have MediaConvert automatically choose this
                               offset. Related setting: When you use this set-
                               ting,  you  must  set  DDS  handling to a value
                               other than None. MediaConvert uses these values
                               to  determine  whether  to  write page position
                               data to the DDS or to the page composition seg-
                               ment  (PCS).  All burn-in and DVB-Sub font set-
                               tings must match.

                            FallbackFont -> (string)
                               Specify the font that you want the  service  to
                               use  for  your burn in captions when your input
                               captions  specify  a  font  that   MediaConvert
                               doesn't  support. When you set Fallback font to
                               best match, or leave blank, MediaConvert uses a
                               supported  font  that  most closely matches the
                               font that your  input  captions  specify.  When
                               there  are  multiple  unsupported fonts in your
                               input captions, MediaConvert matches each  font
                               with the supported font that matches best. When
                               you explicitly choose a replacement font, Medi-
                               aConvert  uses  that font to replace all unsup-
                               ported fonts from your input.

                            FontColor -> (string)
                               Specify the color of the captions  text.  Leave

                            ShadowColor -> (string)
                               Specify the color of the  shadow  cast  by  the
                               captions.  Leave  Shadow  color  blank  and set
                               Style passthrough to enabled to use the  shadow
                               color   data   from  your  input  captions,  if
                               present. Within your job settings, all of  your

                               Specify  the  opacity  of  the  shadow. Enter a
                               value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent and
                               255  is  opaque. If Style passthrough is set to
                               Enabled, leave Shadow  opacity  blank  to  pass
                               through  the  shadow  style information in your
                               input captions  to  your  output  captions.  If
                               Style  passthrough  is  set  to disabled, leave
                               blank to use a value of 0 and remove all  shad-
                               ows  from your output captions. Within your job

                               Specify the vertical offset of the shadow rela-
                               tive to the captions in pixels. A value  of  -2
                               would  result in a shadow offset 2 pixels above
                               the text. Leave Shadow y-offset blank  and  set
                               Style  passthrough to enabled to use the shadow
                               y-offset data  from  your  input  captions,  if
                               present.  Within your job settings, all of your

                               uses default settings for any missing style and
                               position information in  your  input  captions.
                               Set  Style  passthrough  to  DISABLED, or leave
                               blank, to ignore the style and position  infor-

                            XPosition -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  horizontal  position  of the cap-
                               tions, relative to the left side of the  output
                               in  pixels.  A  value of 10 would result in the
                               captions starting 10 pixels from  the  left  of
                               the  output.  If no explicit x_position is pro-

                               option  is  available only when your input cap-
                               tions are IMSC, SMPTE-TT, or TTML. Disable this
                               setting for simplified output captions.

                        SccDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to SCC captions. SCC is a sidecar
                            format that holds captions in a file that is sepa-
                            rate from the video container. Set up sidecar cap-

                            Framerate -> (string)
                               Set  Framerate  to  make sure that the captions
                               and the video are synchronized in  the  output.
                               Specify  a  frame  rate  that matches the frame
                               rate of the  associated  video.  If  the  video
                               frame  rate  is  29.97,  choose 29.97 dropframe
                               only if the video has video_insertion=true  and
                               drop_frame_timecode=true;   otherwise,   choose
                               29.97 non-dropframe.

                        SrtDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to SRT captions. SRT is a sidecar
                            format that holds captions in a file that is sepa-

                               uses default settings for any missing style and
                               position information in  your  input  captions.
                               Set  Style  passthrough  to  DISABLED, or leave
                               blank, to ignore the style and position  infor-

                            PageNumber -> (string)
                               Set pageNumber to the Teletext page number  for
                               the  destination captions for this output. This
                               value must be a three-digit hexadecimal string;
                               strings  ending  in -FF are invalid. If you are
                               passing through  the  entire  set  of  Teletext

                            Settings related to TTML captions. TTML is a side-
                            car  format  that holds captions in a file that is
                            separate from the video container. Set up  sidecar

                            StylePassthrough -> (string)
                               To use the available style, color, and position

                               and  input clipping. Your input captions format
                               must be WebVTT. To ignore the style  and  posi-

                               passthrough to Disabled, or leave blank.

                     LanguageCode -> (string)
                        Specify  the  language  of this captions output track.
                        For most captions output  formats,  the  encoder  puts
                        this language information in the output captions meta-
                        data. If your output captions  format  is  DVB-Sub  or
                        Burn in, the encoder uses this language information to
                        choose the font language for  rendering  the  captions
                        text.

                     LanguageDescription -> (string)
                        Specify  a  label for this set of output captions. For
                        example,   "English",   "Director   commentary",    or
                        "track_2".  For streaming outputs, MediaConvert passes
                        this information into destination manifests  for  dis-
                        play on the end-viewer's player device. For outputs in
                        other output groups, the service ignores this setting.

              ContainerSettings -> (structure)
                 Container specific settings.

                 CmfcSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for
                     the segments in your CMAF outputs.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration.  In all other cases, keep the default
                        value, Default codec duration. When you  choose  Match
                        video  duration,  MediaConvert  pads  the output audio
                        streams with silence or trims them to ensure that  the
                        total  duration  of  each  audio stream is at least as
                        long as the total duration of the video stream.  After
                        padding  or  trimming, the audio stream duration is no
                        more than one frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                        diaConvert  applies  audio padding or trimming only to
                        the end of the last segment of the output. For  unseg-
                        mented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the
                        end of the file. When you keep the default value,  any
                        minor  discrepancies  between audio and video duration
                        will depend on your output audio codec.

                     AudioGroupId -> (string)
                        Specify the audio rendition group for this audio  ren-
                        dition.  Specify up to one value for each audio output
                        in your output group. This value appears in  your  HLS
                        parent  manifest in the EXT-X-MEDIA tag of TYPE=AUDIO,
                        as the value for the GROUP-ID attribute. For  example,
                        if  you  specify  "audio_aac_1" for Audio group ID, it
                        appears  in  your  manifest  like   this:   #EXT-X-ME-
                        DIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio_aac_1".   Related  set-

                        put's setting Audio rendition sets.

                     AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                        List the audio rendition groups that you want included
                        with this video rendition. Use a comma-separated list.
                        For  example, say you want to include the audio rendi-
                        tion  groups  that  have  the  audio  group  IDs  "au-
                        dio_aac_1"  and  "audio_dolby". Then you would specify
                        this value:  "audio_aac_1,audio_dolby".  Related  set-
                        ting:  The  rendition  groups that you include in your
                        comma-separated list should all match values that  you
                        specify in the setting Audio group ID for audio rendi-
                        tions in the same output group as  this  video  rendi-
                        tion.  Default behavior: If you don't specify anything
                        here and for Audio group ID,  MediaConvert  puts  each
                        audio variant in its own audio rendition group and as-
                        sociates it with every video variant.  Each  value  in
                        your  list  appears in your HLS parent manifest in the
                        EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value for the AUDIO attri-
                        bute.  To  continue the previous example, say that the
                        file name for the child manifest for your video rendi-
                        tion  is  "amazing_video_1.m3u8". Then, in your parent

                     AudioTrackType -> (string)
                        Use  this setting to control the values that MediaCon-
                        vert puts in your HLS parent playlist to  control  how
                        the  client  player selects which audio track to play.
                        Choose  Audio-only  variant  stream  (AUDIO_ONLY_VARI-
                        ANT_STREAM)  for any variant that you want to prohibit
                        the client from playing with video. This causes Media-
                        Convert    to    represent    the    variant   as   an
                        EXT-X-STREAM-INF in the HLS manifest.  The  other  op-
                        tions for this setting determine the values that Medi-
                        aConvert writes for the  DEFAULT  and  AUTOSELECT  at-
                        tributes  of the EXT-X-MEDIA entry for the audio vari-
                        ant. For more information about these attributes,  see
                        the         Apple         documentation        article
                        https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist.
                        Choose  Alternate  audio,  auto select, default to set
                        DEFAULT=YES and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this value  for
                        only  one  variant in your output group. Choose Alter-
                        nate audio, auto select, not default to set DEFAULT=NO
                        and  AUTOSELECT=YES.  Choose Alternate Audio, Not Auto
                        Select to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=NO.  When  you
                        don't  specify  a value for this setting, MediaConvert
                        defaults to Alternate  audio,  auto  select,  default.
                        When  there  is  more  than one variant in your output
                        group, you must explicitly choose  a  value  for  this
                        setting.

                     DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                        Specify  whether  to flag this audio track as descrip-
                        tive video service (DVS) in your HLS parent  manifest.
                        When you choose Flag, MediaConvert includes the param-
                        eter         CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.de-
                        scribes-video"  in  the  EXT-X-MEDIA  entry  for  this
                        track. When you keep the default choice,  Don't  flag,
                        MediaConvert  leaves  this parameter out. The DVS flag
                        can help with accessibility on Apple devices. For more
                        information, see the Apple documentation.

                     IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                        Choose  Include  to  have MediaConvert generate an HLS
                        child manifest that lists only the I-frames  for  this
                        rendition,  in  addition  to your regular manifest for
                        this rendition. You might use this manifest as part of
                        a  workflow  that  creates  preview functions for your
                        video. MediaConvert adds both the I-frame  only  child
                        manifest  and the regular child manifest to the parent
                        manifest. When you don't need the I-frame  only  child
                        manifest, keep the default value Exclude.

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include  key-length-value metadata in this output:
                        Set KLV metadata insertion to  Passthrough.  MediaCon-
                        vert  reads  KLV  metadata  present  in your input and
                        writes each instance to a separate event  message  box
                        in  the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude
                        this KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata insertion to  None
                        or leave blank.

                     ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                        To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD
                        manifest for each type of event message, set  Manifest
                        metadata signaling to Enabled. For ID3 event messages,
                        the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will be same
                        value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI.
                        For SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream  ele-
                        ment  schemeIdUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
                        To leave these elements out of your output  MPD  mani-
                        fest,  set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled. To
                        enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must also  set
                        SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert,
                        or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                     Scte35Esam -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers
                        from  ESAM.  Choose  INSERT  to put SCTE-35 markers in
                        this output at the insertion points that  you  specify
                        in  an  ESAM XML document. Provide the document in the
                        setting SCC XML.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in
                        your  input video file. Choose Passthrough if you want
                        SCTE-35 markers that appear in your input to also  ap-
                        pear  in  this  output.  Choose None if you don't want
                        those SCTE-35 markers in this output.

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        To include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3  meta-
                        data to Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata in Cus-
                        tom ID3 metadata inserter.  MediaConvert  writes  each
                        instance  of  ID3 metadata in a separate Event Message
                        (eMSG) box. To exclude  this  ID3  metadata:  Set  ID3
                        metadata to None or leave blank.

                     TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                        Specify  the  event message box (eMSG) version for ID3
                        timed metadata in your output. For  more  information,
                        see  ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section 5.10.3.3.3 Syntax.
                        Leave blank to use the default value Version  0.  When
                        you  specify Version 1, you must also set ID3 metadata
                        to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI for
                        ID3  timed  metadata in your output. For more informa-
                        tion, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4  Se-
                        mantics.   Leave  blank  to  use  the  default  value:
                        https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a  value
                        for  ID3 metadata scheme ID URI, you must also set ID3
                        metadata to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box  (eMSG)  value  for  ID3
                        timed  metadata  in your output. For more information,
                        see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics.
                        When  you  specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value, you
                        must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                 Container -> (string)
                     Container for this output. Some containers require a con-
                     tainer settings object. If not specified, the default ob-
                     ject will be created.

                 F4vSettings -> (structure)
                     Settings for F4v container

                     MoovPlacement -> (string)
                        To place the MOOV atom at the beginning of  your  out-
                        put,  which  is  useful  for  progressive downloading:
                        Leave blank or choose Progressive download.  To  place
                        the MOOV at the end of your output: Choose Normal.

                 M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                     MPEG-2 TS container settings. These apply to outputs in a
                     File output group when the output's container  is  MPEG-2
                     Transport  Stream  (M2TS). In these assets, data is orga-
                     nized by the program  map  table  (PMT).  Each  transport
                     stream program contains subsets of data, including audio,
                     video, and metadata. Each of these subsets of data has  a
                     numerical  label  called  a packet identifier (PID). Each
                     transport stream program corresponds to one  MediaConvert
                     output.  The  PMT  lists  the  types of data in a program
                     along with their PID. Downstream systems and players  use
                     the program map table to look up the PID for each type of
                     data it accesses and then uses the PIDs  to  locate  spe-
                     cific data within the asset.

                     AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                        Selects  between  the  DVB  and ATSC buffer models for
                        Dolby Digital audio.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify this setting only when  your  output  will  be
                        consumed  by a downstream repackaging workflow that is
                        sensitive to very small duration  differences  between
                        video  and  audio.  For  this  situation, choose Match
                        video duration. In all other cases, keep  the  default
                        value,  Default  codec duration. When you choose Match
                        video duration, MediaConvert  pads  the  output  audio
                        streams  with silence or trims them to ensure that the
                        total duration of each audio stream  is  at  least  as
                        long  as the total duration of the video stream. After
                        padding or trimming, the audio stream duration  is  no
                        more  than one frame longer than the video stream. Me-
                        diaConvert applies audio padding or trimming  only  to
                        the  end of the last segment of the output. For unseg-
                        mented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to  the
                        end  of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                        minor discrepancies between audio and  video  duration
                        will depend on your output audio codec.

                     AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  audio  frames  to insert for each PES
                        packet.

                     AudioPids -> (list)
                        Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for any  elemen-
                        tary audio streams you include in this output. Specify
                        multiple PIDs as a JSON array. Default  is  the  range
                        482-492.

                        (integer)

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Specify  the output bitrate of the transport stream in
                        bits per second. Setting to 0 lets the muxer automati-
                        cally  determine the appropriate bitrate. Other common
                        values are 3750000, 7500000, and 15000000.

                     BufferModel -> (string)
                        Controls what buffer model to use for accurate  inter-
                        leaving.  If  set  to  MULTIPLEX, use multiplex buffer
                        model. If set to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                        but  low-memory  devices  may not be able to play back
                        the stream without interruptions.

                     DataPTSControl -> (string)
                        If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes cap-
                        tions  and  data  packets  with Presentation Timestamp
                        (PTS) values greater than or equal to the first  video
                        packet PTS (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                        ets with lesser PTS values). Keep the default value to
                        allow all PTS values.

                     DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to insert a DVB Network Information
                        Table (NIT) in the transport stream of this output.

                        NetworkId -> (integer)
                            The numeric value placed in the  Network  Informa-
                            tion Table (NIT).

                        NetworkName -> (string)
                            The   network   name   text  placed  in  the  net-
                            work_name_descriptor inside the  Network  Informa-
                            tion Table. Maximum length is 256 characters.

                        NitInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  milliseconds between instances of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                     DvbSdtSettings -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to insert a DVB Service Description
                        Table (SDT) in the transport stream of this output.

                        OutputSdt -> (string)
                            Selects  method  of inserting SDT information into
                            output stream. "Follow input SDT" copies  SDT  in-
                            formation  from  input  stream  to  output stream.
                            "Follow input SDT if present" copies SDT  informa-
                            tion from input stream to output stream if SDT in-
                            formation is present in the  input,  otherwise  it
                            will  fall  back on the user-defined values. Enter
                            "SDT Manually" means user will enter the  SDT  in-
                            formation.  "No  SDT" means output stream will not
                            contain SDT information.

                        SdtInterval -> (integer)
                            The number of milliseconds  between  instances  of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        ServiceName -> (string)
                            The  service name placed in the service_descriptor
                            in the Service Description Table.  Maximum  length
                            is 256 characters.

                        ServiceProviderName -> (string)
                            The  service  provider  name  placed  in  the ser-
                            vice_descriptor in the Service Description  Table.
                            Maximum length is 256 characters.

                     DvbSubPids -> (list)
                        Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for DVB subtitle
                        data included in this output. Specify multiple PIDs as
                        a JSON array. Default is the range 460-479.

                        (integer)

                     DvbTdtSettings -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to insert a DVB Time and Date Table
                        (TDT) in the transport stream of this output.

                        TdtInterval -> (integer)
                            The number of milliseconds  between  instances  of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                     DvbTeletextPid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) for DVB teletext
                        data you include in this output. Default is 499.

                     EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                        When set to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS, audio EBP mark-
                        ers  will be added to partitions 3 and 4. The interval
                        between these additional markers will  be  fixed,  and
                        will be slightly shorter than the video EBP marker in-
                        terval. When set to VIDEO_INTERVAL,  these  additional
                        markers will not be inserted. Only applicable when EBP
                        segmentation markers are  is  selected  (segmentation-
                        Markers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                     EbpPlacement -> (string)
                        Selects  which  PIDs to place EBP markers on. They can
                        either be placed only on the video PID, or on both the
                        video PID and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when EBP
                        segmentation markers are  is  selected  (segmentation-
                        Markers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                     EsRateInPes -> (string)
                        Controls  whether  to include the ES Rate field in the
                        PES header.

                     ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                        Keep the default value unless you know that your audio
                        EBP  markers  are  incorrectly  appearing  before your
                        video EBP markers. To correct this problem,  set  this
                        value to Force.

                     FragmentTime -> (double)
                        The  length,  in  seconds, of each fragment. Only used
                        with EBP markers.

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To include key-length-value metadata in  this  output:
                        Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaCon-
                        vert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your  input  and
                        passes  it  through to the output transport stream. To
                        exclude this KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata  insertion
                        to None or leave blank.

                     MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  maximum  time,  in milliseconds, between
                        Program Clock  References  (PCRs)  inserted  into  the
                        transport stream.

                     MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                        When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary Points do not
                        come within the specified time interval of each  other
                        by looking ahead at input video. If another EBP is go-
                        ing to come in within the specified time interval, the
                        current  EBP  is  not  emitted,  and  the  segment  is
                        "stretched" to the next marker.  The  lookahead  value
                        does  not  add  latency  to the system. The Live Event
                        must be configured elsewhere to create sufficient  la-
                        tency to make the lookahead accurate.

                     NielsenId3 -> (string)
                        If  INSERT, Nielsen inaudible tones for media tracking
                        will be detected in the input audio and an  equivalent
                        ID3 tag will be inserted in the output.

                     NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                        Value  in bits per second of extra null packets to in-
                        sert into the transport stream. This can be used if  a
                        downstream  encryption  system  requires periodic null
                        packets.

                     PatInterval -> (integer)
                        The number of milliseconds between instances  of  this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PcrControl -> (string)
                        When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program Clock Ref-
                        erence value is inserted for every Packetized  Elemen-
                        tary  Stream (PES) header. This is effective only when
                        the PCR PID is the same as the video or audio  elemen-
                        tary stream.

                     PcrPid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet  identifier (PID) for the program
                        clock reference (PCR) in this output. If  you  do  not
                        specify  a  value,  the service will use the value for
                        Video PID.

                     PmtInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify the number of milliseconds  between  instances
                        of the program map table (PMT) in the output transport
                        stream.

                     PmtPid -> (integer)
                        Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for  the  program
                        map table (PMT) itself. Default is 480.

                     PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet  identifier  (PID) of the private
                        metadata stream. Default is 503.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use Program number to specify the program number  used
                        in  the  program  map table (PMT) for this output. De-
                        fault is 1. Program numbers and program map tables are
                        parts  of MPEG-2 transport stream containers, used for
                        organizing data.

                     PtsOffset -> (integer)
                        Manually specify the initial PTS offset,  in  seconds,
                        when  you  set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter an integer
                        from 0 to 3600. Leave blank to keep the default  value
                        2.

                     PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                        Specify  the initial presentation timestamp (PTS) off-
                        set for your transport stream output. To let MediaCon-
                        vert  automatically  determine the initial PTS offset:
                        Keep the default value, Auto. We  recommend  that  you
                        choose  Auto  for the widest player compatibility. The
                        initial PTS will be at least two seconds and vary  de-
                        pending  on your output's bitrate, HRD buffer size and
                        HRD buffer initial fill percentage. To manually  spec-
                        ify  an initial PTS offset: Choose Seconds. Then spec-
                        ify the number of seconds with PTS offset.

                     RateMode -> (string)
                        When set to CBR, inserts null packets  into  transport
                        stream to fill specified bitrate. When set to VBR, the
                        bitrate setting acts as the maximum bitrate,  but  the
                        output will not be padded up to that bitrate.

                     Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                        Include this in your job settings to put SCTE-35 mark-
                        ers in your HLS and transport stream  outputs  at  the
                        insertion points that you specify in an ESAM XML docu-
                        ment. Provide the document in the setting SCC XML.

                        Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35  stream  in
                            the transport stream generated by ESAM.

                     Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet  identifier  (PID) of the SCTE-35
                        stream in the transport stream.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        For  SCTE-35  markers   from   your   input--   Choose
                        Passthrough if you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in
                        your input to also appear in this output. Choose  None
                        if  you don't want SCTE-35 markers in this output. For
                        SCTE-35 markers from an  ESAM  XML  document--  Choose
                        None.  Also  provide  the  ESAM XML as a string in the
                        setting Signal processing notification XML.  Also  en-
                        able ESAM SCTE-35 (include the property scte35Esam).

                     SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                        Inserts segmentation markers at each segmentation_time
                        period. rai_segstart sets the Random Access  Indicator
                        bit  in  the  adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the RAI
                        bit and adds the current timecode in the private  data
                        bytes.  psi_segstart inserts PAT and PMT tables at the
                        start of segments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point in-
                        formation  to  the  adaptation  field as per OpenCable
                        specification  OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118.  ebp_legacy  adds
                        Encoder  Boundary  Point information to the adaptation
                        field using a legacy proprietary format.

                     SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                        The segmentation style parameter controls how  segmen-
                        tation markers are inserted into the transport stream.
                        With avails, it is possible that segments may be trun-
                        cated,  which  can influence where future segmentation
                        markers are inserted. When  a  segmentation  style  of
                        "reset_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated
                        due to an avail, we will reset  the  segmentation  ca-
                        dence.  This  means the subsequent segment will have a
                        duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a seg-
                        mentation  style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and
                        a segment is truncated due to an avail,  we  will  not
                        reset  the segmentation cadence. This means the subse-
                        quent segment will likely be truncated as  well.  How-
                        ever,  all segments after that will have a duration of
                        $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is
                        a slight exception to this rule.

                     SegmentationTime -> (double)
                        Specify  the  length, in seconds, of each segment. Re-
                        quired unless markers is set to _none_.

                     TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream  in
                        the transport stream.

                     TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                        Specify  the ID for the transport stream itself in the
                        program map table for this  output.  Transport  stream
                        IDs  and program map tables are parts of MPEG-2 trans-
                        port stream containers, used for organizing data.

                     VideoPid -> (integer)
                        Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the  elementary
                        video stream in the transport stream.

                 M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                     These  settings  relate  to  the  MPEG-2 transport stream
                     (MPEG2-TS) container for the MPEG2-TS  segments  in  your
                     HLS outputs.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration.  In all other cases, keep the default
                        value, Default codec duration. When you  choose  Match
                        video  duration,  MediaConvert  pads  the output audio
                        streams with silence or trims them to ensure that  the
                        total  duration  of  each  audio stream is at least as
                        long as the total duration of the video stream.  After
                        padding  or  trimming, the audio stream duration is no
                        more than one frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                        diaConvert  applies  audio padding or trimming only to
                        the end of the last segment of the output. For  unseg-
                        mented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the
                        end of the file. When you keep the default value,  any
                        minor  discrepancies  between audio and video duration
                        will depend on your output audio codec.

                     AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                        The number of audio frames  to  insert  for  each  PES
                        packet.

                     AudioPids -> (list)
                        Packet   Identifier  (PID)  of  the  elementary  audio
                        stream(s) in the transport stream. Multiple values are
                        accepted, and can be entered in ranges and/or by comma
                        separation.

                        (integer)

                     DataPTSControl -> (string)
                        If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes cap-
                        tions  and  data  packets  with Presentation Timestamp
                        (PTS) values greater than or equal to the first  video
                        packet PTS (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                        ets with lesser PTS values). Keep  the  default  value
                        AUTO to allow all PTS values.

                     MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  maximum  time,  in milliseconds, between
                        Program Clock  References  (PCRs)  inserted  into  the
                        transport stream.

                     NielsenId3 -> (string)
                        If  INSERT, Nielsen inaudible tones for media tracking
                        will be detected in the input audio and an  equivalent
                        ID3 tag will be inserted in the output.

                     PatInterval -> (integer)
                        The  number  of milliseconds between instances of this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PcrControl -> (string)
                        When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Program Clock  Ref-
                        erence  value is inserted for every Packetized Elemen-
                        tary Stream (PES) header. This parameter is  effective
                        only  when the PCR PID is the same as the video or au-
                        dio elementary stream.

                     PcrPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the Program Clock Reference
                        (PCR) in the transport stream. When no value is given,
                        the encoder will assign the same value  as  the  Video
                        PID.

                     PmtInterval -> (integer)
                        The  number  of milliseconds between instances of this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PmtPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID)  for  the  Program  Map  Table
                        (PMT) in the transport stream.

                     PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the private metadata stream
                        in the transport stream.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        The value of the program number field in  the  Program
                        Map Table.

                     PtsOffset -> (integer)
                        Manually  specify  the initial PTS offset, in seconds,
                        when you set PTS offset to Seconds. Enter  an  integer
                        from  0 to 3600. Leave blank to keep the default value
                        2.

                     PtsOffsetMode -> (string)
                        Specify the initial presentation timestamp (PTS)  off-
                        set for your transport stream output. To let MediaCon-
                        vert automatically determine the initial  PTS  offset:
                        Keep  the  default  value, Auto. We recommend that you
                        choose Auto for the widest player  compatibility.  The
                        initial  PTS will be at least two seconds and vary de-
                        pending on your output's bitrate, HRD buffer size  and
                        HRD  buffer initial fill percentage. To manually spec-
                        ify an initial PTS offset: Choose Seconds. Then  spec-
                        ify the number of seconds with PTS offset.

                     Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                        Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream in the
                        transport stream.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        For  SCTE-35  markers   from   your   input--   Choose
                        Passthrough if you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in
                        your input to also appear in this output. Choose  None
                        if  you don't want SCTE-35 markers in this output. For
                        SCTE-35 markers from an  ESAM  XML  document--  Choose
                        None  if  you don't want manifest conditioning. Choose
                        Passthrough and choose Ad markers if you do want mani-
                        fest  conditioning.  In  both  cases, also provide the
                        ESAM XML as a string in the setting Signal  processing
                        notification XML.

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        Set  ID3  metadata to Passthrough to include ID3 meta-
                        data in this output. This includes ID3  metadata  from
                        the following features: ID3 timestamp period, and Cus-
                        tom ID3 metadata inserter. To exclude this  ID3  meta-
                        data in this output: set ID3 metadata to None or leave
                        blank.

                     TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream  in
                        the transport stream.

                     TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                        The value of the transport stream ID field in the Pro-
                        gram Map Table.

                     VideoPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the elementary video stream
                        in the transport stream.

                 MovSettings -> (structure)
                     These  settings  relate to your QuickTime MOV output con-
                     tainer.

                     ClapAtom -> (string)
                        When enabled, include 'clap' atom if  appropriate  for
                        the video output settings.

                     CslgAtom -> (string)
                        When  enabled,  file  composition  times will start at
                        zero, composition times  in  the  'ctts'  (composition
                        time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative, and
                        a 'cslg' (composition shift least greatest)  box  will
                        be  included  per  14496-1  amendment 1. This improves
                        compatibility with Apple players and tools.

                     Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                        When set to XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video streams into the
                        QuickTime  file  using  XDCAM  fourcc  codes. This in-
                        creases compatibility with Apple editors and  players,
                        but  may  decrease  compatibility  with other players.
                        Only applicable when the video codec is MPEG2.

                     PaddingControl -> (string)
                        Unless you need Omneon compatibility: Keep the default
                        value,  None.  To make this output compatible with Om-
                        neon: Choose Omneon. When  you  do,  MediaConvert  in-
                        creases  the length of the 'elst' edit list atom. Note
                        that this might cause file rejections when a recipient
                        of the output file doesn't expect this extra padding.

                     Reference -> (string)
                        Always  keep  the  default  value (SELF_CONTAINED) for
                        this setting.

                 Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to your MP4 output  container.  You
                     can  create  audio  only outputs with this container. For
                     more                   information,                   see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/supported-codecs-containers-audio-only.html#output-codecs-and-containers-supported-for-audio-only.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify this setting only when  your  output  will  be
                        consumed  by a downstream repackaging workflow that is
                        sensitive to very small duration  differences  between
                        video  and  audio.  For  this  situation, choose Match
                        video duration. In all other cases, keep  the  default
                        value,  Default  codec duration. When you choose Match
                        video duration, MediaConvert  pads  the  output  audio
                        streams  with silence or trims them to ensure that the
                        total duration of each audio stream  is  at  least  as
                        long  as the total duration of the video stream. After
                        padding or trimming, the audio stream duration  is  no
                        more  than one frame longer than the video stream. Me-
                        diaConvert applies audio padding or trimming  only  to
                        the  end of the last segment of the output. For unseg-
                        mented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to  the
                        end  of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                        minor discrepancies between audio and  video  duration
                        will depend on your output audio codec.

                     CslgAtom -> (string)
                        When  enabled,  file  composition  times will start at
                        zero, composition times  in  the  'ctts'  (composition
                        time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative, and
                        a 'cslg' (composition shift least greatest)  box  will
                        be  included  per  14496-1  amendment 1. This improves
                        compatibility with Apple players and tools.

                     CttsVersion -> (integer)
                        Ignore this setting unless compliance to the CTTS  box
                        version  specification matters in your workflow. Spec-
                        ify a value of 1 to set your CTTS box version to 1 and
                        make  your  output  compliant  with the specification.
                        When you specify a value of 1, you must also set  CSLG
                        atom to the value INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0 to
                        set your CTTS box version to 0. This can provide back-
                        ward compatibility for some players and packagers.

                     FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                        Inserts  a  free-space  box immediately after the moov
                        box.

                     MoovPlacement -> (string)
                        To place the MOOV atom at the beginning of  your  out-
                        put,  which  is  useful  for  progressive downloading:
                        Leave blank or choose Progressive download.  To  place
                        the MOOV at the end of your output: Choose Normal.

                     Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                        Overrides  the "Major Brand" field in the output file.
                        Usually not necessary to specify.

                 MpdSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for
                     the segments in your DASH outputs.

                     AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                        Optional.  Choose Include to have MediaConvert mark up
                        your DASH manifest with elements for embedded 608 cap-
                        tions.  This markup isn't generally required, but some
                        video players require it to discover and play embedded
                        608  captions.  Keep  the  default  value, Exclude, to
                        leave these elements out. When you  enable  this  set-
                        ting, this is the markup that MediaConvert includes in
                        your manifest:

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify this setting only when  your  output  will  be
                        consumed  by a downstream repackaging workflow that is
                        sensitive to very small duration  differences  between
                        video  and  audio.  For  this  situation, choose Match
                        video duration. In all other cases, keep  the  default
                        value,  Default  codec duration. When you choose Match
                        video duration, MediaConvert  pads  the  output  audio
                        streams  with silence or trims them to ensure that the
                        total duration of each audio stream  is  at  least  as
                        long  as the total duration of the video stream. After
                        padding or trimming, the audio stream duration  is  no
                        more  than one frame longer than the video stream. Me-
                        diaConvert applies audio padding or trimming  only  to
                        the  end of the last segment of the output. For unseg-
                        mented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to  the
                        end  of the file. When you keep the default value, any
                        minor discrepancies between audio and  video  duration
                        will depend on your output audio codec.

                     CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting only in DASH output groups that in-
                        clude sidecar TTML or IMSC captions. You specify side-
                        car  captions in a separate output from your audio and
                        video. Choose Raw for captions in a single XML file in
                        a raw container. Choose Fragmented MPEG-4 for captions
                        in XML format contained within fragmented  MP4  files.
                        This set of fragmented MP4 files is separate from your
                        video and audio fragmented MP4 files.

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To include key-length-value metadata in  this  output:
                        Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaCon-
                        vert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your  input  and
                        writes  each  instance to a separate event message box
                        in the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To  exclude
                        this  KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata insertion to None
                        or leave blank.

                     ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                        To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD
                        manifest  for each type of event message, set Manifest
                        metadata signaling to Enabled. For ID3 event messages,
                        the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will be same
                        value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI.
                        For  SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream ele-
                        ment schemeIdUri will  be  "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
                        To  leave  these elements out of your output MPD mani-
                        fest, set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled.  To
                        enable  Manifest metadata signaling, you must also set
                        SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert,
                        or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                     Scte35Esam -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers
                        from ESAM. Choose INSERT to  put  SCTE-35  markers  in
                        this  output  at the insertion points that you specify
                        in an ESAM XML document. Provide the document  in  the
                        setting SCC XML.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in
                        your input video file. Choose Passthrough if you  want
                        SCTE-35  markers that appear in your input to also ap-
                        pear in this output. Choose None  if  you  don't  want
                        those SCTE-35 markers in this output.

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 meta-
                        data to Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata in Cus-
                        tom  ID3  metadata  inserter. MediaConvert writes each
                        instance of ID3 metadata in a separate  Event  Message
                        (eMSG)  box.  To  exclude  this  ID3 metadata: Set ID3
                        metadata to None or leave blank.

                     TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box (eMSG) version  for  ID3
                        timed  metadata  in your output. For more information,
                        see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022  section  5.10.3.3.3  Syntax.
                        Leave  blank  to use the default value Version 0. When
                        you specify Version 1, you must also set ID3  metadata
                        to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI for
                        ID3 timed metadata in your output. For  more  informa-
                        tion,  see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4 Se-

                        https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3  When you specify a value
                        for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI, you must also set  ID3
                        metadata to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                        Specify  the  event  message  box (eMSG) value for ID3
                        timed metadata in your output. For  more  information,
                        see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics.
                        When you specify a value for ID3 Metadata  Value,  you
                        must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.

                 MxfSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to your MXF output container.

                     AfdSignaling -> (string)
                        Optional.  When  you have AFD signaling set up in your
                        output  video  stream,  use  this  setting  to  choose
                        whether  to also include it in the MXF wrapper. Choose
                        Don't copy to exclude AFD signaling from the MXF wrap-
                        per.  Choose  Copy  from  video stream to copy the AFD
                        values from the video stream for this  output  to  the
                        MXF  wrapper.  Regardless  of which option you choose,
                        the AFD values remain in  the  video  stream.  Related
                        settings:  To set up your output to include or exclude
                        AFD values, see AfdSignaling, under  VideoDescription.
                        On  the console, find AFD signaling under the output's
                        video encoding settings.

                     Profile -> (string)
                        Specify the MXF profile, also called  shim,  for  this
                        output. To automatically select a profile according to
                        your output video codec and resolution,  leave  blank.

                     XavcProfileSettings -> (structure)
                        Specify the XAVC profile settings for MXF outputs when
                        you set your MXF profile to XAVC.

                        DurationMode -> (string)
                            To create an output that complies  with  the  XAVC
                            file  format guidelines for interoperability, keep
                            the default value, Drop frames for compliance.  To
                            include all frames from your input in this output,
                            keep the default setting, Allow any duration.  The
                            number  of  frames that MediaConvert excludes when
                            you set this to Drop frames for compliance depends
                            on the output frame rate and duration.

                        MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                            Specify  a value for this setting only for outputs
                            that you set up with one of these  two  XAVC  pro-
                            files:  XAVC  HD  Intra  CBG or XAVC 4K Intra CBG.
                            Specify the amount of space in each frame that the
                            service reserves for ancillary data, such as tele-
                            text captions. The default value for this  setting
                            is 1492 bytes per frame. This should be sufficient
                            to prevent overflow unless you have multiple pages
                            of  teletext  captions  data.  If you have a large
                            amount of teletext data, specify a larger number.

              VideoDescription -> (structure)
                 VideoDescription contains a group of video encoding settings.
                 The  specific  video  settings depend on the video codec that
                 you choose for the property codec. Include  one  instance  of
                 VideoDescription per output.

                 AfdSignaling -> (string)
                     This setting only applies to H.264, H.265, and MPEG2 out-
                     puts. Use Insert AFD signaling  to  specify  whether  the
                     service  includes AFD values in the output video data and
                     what those values are. * Choose None to  remove  all  AFD
                     values  from  this output. * Choose Fixed to ignore input
                     AFD values and instead encode the value specified in  the
                     job.  *  Choose Auto to calculate output AFD values based
                     on the input AFD scaler data.

                 AntiAlias -> (string)
                     The anti-alias filter is  automatically  applied  to  all
                     outputs. The service no longer accepts the value DISABLED
                     for AntiAlias. If you specify that in your job, the  ser-
                     vice will ignore the setting.

                 CodecSettings -> (structure)
                     Video  codec  settings contains the group of settings re-
                     lated to video encoding. The settings in this group  vary
                     depending  on  the value that you choose for Video codec.
                     For each codec enum that you choose,  define  the  corre-
                     sponding  settings  object. The following lists the codec
                     enum, settings object pairs. * AV1, Av1Settings * AVC_IN-
                     TRA,  AvcIntraSettings  * FRAME_CAPTURE, FrameCaptureSet-
                     tings *  H_264,  H264Settings  *  H_265,  H265Settings  *
                     MPEG2,  Mpeg2Settings  *  PRORES,  ProresSettings  * VC3,
                     Vc3Settings * VP8, Vp8Settings * VP9, Vp9Settings * XAVC,
                     XavcSettings

                     Av1Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  Codec,  under  VideoDescrip-
                        tion>CodecSettings to the value AV1.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Specify the strength of any adaptive  quantization
                            filters that you enable. The value that you choose
                            here applies to Spatial adaptive quantization.

                        BitDepth -> (string)
                            Specify the Bit depth. You  can  choose  8-bit  or
                            10-bit.

                        FilmGrainSynthesis -> (string)
                            Film  grain  synthesis replaces film grain present
                            in your content with similar  quality  synthesized
                            AV1  film  grain. We recommend that you choose En-
                            abled to reduce the bandwidth of your QVBR quality
                            level  5,  6,  7,  or  8 outputs. For QVBR quality
                            level 9 or 10 outputs we recommend that  you  keep
                            the default value, Disabled. When you include Film
                            grain synthesis, you cannot include the Noise  re-
                            ducer preprocessor.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            Use  the  Framerate  setting  to specify the frame
                            rate for this output. If you want to keep the same
                            frame  rate  as  the  input  video,  choose Follow
                            source. If you want to do frame  rate  conversion,
                            choose  a  frame  rate  from  the dropdown list or
                            choose Custom. The framerates shown in  the  drop-
                            down list are decimal approximations of fractions.
                            If you choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a
                            fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Specify the  GOP  length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                            frames. With AV1, MediaConvert doesn't support GOP
                            length in seconds. This value must be greater than
                            zero and preferably equal to 1 + ((numberBFrames +
                            1) * x), where x is an integer value.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify from the number of B-frames, in the  range
                            of 0-15. For AV1 encoding, we recommend using 7 or
                            15. Choose a larger number for a lower bitrate and
                            smaller  file  size;  choose  a smaller number for
                            better video quality.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate  en-
                            coding  with  the  H.265 codec. Use these settings
                            only when you set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode  to QVBR. Specify the target quality level
                               for this output.  MediaConvert  determines  the
                               right  number  of  bits to use for each part of
                               the video to maintain the  video  quality  that
                               you  specify.  When you keep the default value,
                               AUTO, MediaConvert picks a  quality  level  for
                               you,  based  on  characteristics  of your input
                               video. If  you  prefer  to  specify  a  quality
                               level,  specify a number from 1 through 10. Use
                               higher numbers for greater  quality.  Level  10
                               results  in  nearly  lossless  compression. The
                               quality  level   for   most   broadcast-quality
                               transcodes  is  between 6 and 9. Optionally, to
                               specify a value  between  whole  numbers,  also
                               provide  a  value  for  the  setting  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your
                               QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set qvbrQual-
                               ityLevel to 7 and set  qvbrQualityLevelFineTune
                               to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional.  Specify a value here to set the QVBR
                               quality to a level that is between  whole  num-
                               bers.  For example, if you want your QVBR qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert rounds your QVBR quality level  to  the
                               nearest  third  of a whole number. For example,
                               if you set qvbrQualityLevel to 7  and  you  set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to  .25,  your actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            'With AV1 outputs, for rate control  mode,  Media-
                            Convert supports only quality-defined variable bi-
                            trate (QVBR). You can''t use CBR or VBR.'

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of  slices  per  picture.  This
                            value  must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For progres-
                            sive pictures, this value must  be  less  than  or
                            equal to the number of macroblock rows. For inter-
                            laced pictures, this value must be  less  than  or
                            equal to half the number of macroblock rows.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quanti-
                            zation within each frame based on  spatial  varia-
                            tion  of  content complexity. When you enable this
                            feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that
                            can  sustain  more  distortion  with no noticeable
                            visual degradation and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                            where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
                            example, complex textured blocks are encoded  with
                            fewer  bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded
                            with more bits. Enabling this feature will  almost
                            always  improve  your video quality. Note, though,
                            that this feature doesn't take into account  where
                            the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers
                            are likely to be focusing  their  attention  on  a
                            part  of the screen with a lot of complex texture,
                            you might choose to disable this feature.  Related
                            setting:  When you enable spatial adaptive quanti-
                            zation, set the value  for  Adaptive  quantization
                            depending  on  your  content. For homogeneous con-
                            tent, such as cartoons and video games, set it  to
                            Low. For content with a wider variety of textures,
                            set it to High or Higher.

                     AvcIntraSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you choose  AVC-Intra  for  your  output
                        video  codec. For more information about the AVC-Intra
                        settings, see the relevant specification. For detailed
                        information   about   SD  and  HD  in  AVC-Intra,  see
                        https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7290936. For  in-
                        formation    about    4K/2K    in    AVC-Intra,    see
                        https://pro-av.panasonic.net/en/avc-ultra/AVC-ULTRAoverview.pdf.

                        AvcIntraClass -> (string)
                            Specify  the  AVC-Intra  class of your output. The
                            AVC-Intra class selection  determines  the  output
                            video  bit rate depending on the frame rate of the
                            output. Outputs  with  higher  class  values  have
                            higher  bitrates  and improved image quality. Note
                            that for Class 4K/2K, MediaConvert  supports  only
                            4:2:2 chroma subsampling.

                        AvcIntraUhdSettings -> (structure)
                            Optional  when  you  set  AVC-Intra class to Class
                            4K/2K. When you set AVC-Intra class to a different
                            value, this object isn't allowed.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional.  Use  Quality  tuning level to choose
                               how many transcoding passes  MediaConvert  does
                               with  your  video.  When you choose Multi-pass,
                               your video quality is better  and  your  output
                               bitrate  is  more accurate. That is, the actual
                               bitrate of your output is closer to the  target
                               bitrate  defined in the specification. When you
                               choose  Single-pass,  your  encoding  time   is
                               faster. The default behavior is Single-pass.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use  Top field first or Bottom field first to cre-
                            ate an output  that's  interlaced  with  the  same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or Follow, default bottom to produce outputs  with
                            the  same  field  polarity as the source. For jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity  might  change  over the course of the output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the  source  is interlaced, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with the same polarity as the source.  If
                            the  source is progressive, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with top field bottom  field  first,  de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing to create a better quality interlaced  out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input corresponds to an interlaced  field  in  the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for all other output frame rates. With  basic  in-
                            terlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any frame rate
                            conversion first and then interlaces  the  frames.
                            When  you choose Optimized interlacing and you set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically falls back  to  basic  interlacing.  Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must set Telecine to None or Soft. You  can't  use
                            optimized  interlacing  for hard telecine outputs.
                            You must also set Interlace mode to a value  other
                            than Progressive.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate to 25.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When  you  do  frame  rate  conversion from 23.976
                            frames per second (fps) to  29.97  fps,  and  your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable hard telecine to create a smoother picture.
                            When  you  keep the default value, None, MediaCon-
                            vert does a  standard  frame  rate  conversion  to
                            29.97 without doing anything with the field polar-
                            ity to create a smoother picture.

                     Codec -> (string)
                        Specifies the video codec. This must be equal  to  one
                        of  the  enum values defined by the object VideoCodec.

                        out any video encoding:  Choose  Passthrough.  If  you
                        have  multiple  input videos, note that they must have
                        identical  encoding  attributes.   When   you   choose
                        Passthrough,  your  output  container  must  be MXF or
                        QuickTime MOV.

                     FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to  the  value  FRAME_CAP-
                        TURE.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Frame  capture  will encode the first frame of the
                            output stream, then one frame  every  framerateDe-
                            nominator/framerateNumerator seconds. For example,
                            settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and  framerate-
                            Denominator  =  3 (a rate of 1/3 frame per second)
                            will capture the first frame, then 1  frame  every
                            3s.  Files will be named as filename.n.jpg where n
                            is the 0-based sequence number of each Capture.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Frame capture will encode the first frame  of  the
                            output  stream,  then one frame every framerateDe-
                            nominator/framerateNumerator seconds. For example,
                            settings  of framerateNumerator = 1 and framerate-
                            Denominator = 3 (a rate of 1/3 frame  per  second)
                            will  capture  the first frame, then 1 frame every
                            3s. Files will be  named  as  filename.NNNNNNN.jpg
                            where  N is the 0-based frame sequence number zero
                            padded to 7 decimal places.

                        MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                            Maximum number of  captures  (encoded  jpg  output
                            files).

                        Quality -> (integer)
                            JPEG  Quality - a higher value equals higher qual-
                            ity.

                     H264Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value H_264.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Auto, for this setting  to
                            have  MediaConvert  automatically  apply  the best
                            types of quantization for your video content. When
                            you want to apply your quantization settings manu-
                            ally, you must set H264AdaptiveQuantization  to  a
                            value other than Auto. Use this setting to specify
                            the strength of any adaptive quantization  filters
                            that you enable. If you don't want MediaConvert to
                            do any adaptive quantization  in  this  transcode,
                            set  Adaptive  quantization  to  Off. Related set-
                            tings: The value that you choose here  applies  to
                            the following settings: H264FlickerAdaptiveQuanti-
                            zation,    H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization,    and
                            H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization.

                        BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                            The Bandwidth reduction filter increases the video
                            quality of your output relative  to  its  bitrate.
                            Use  to lower the bitrate of your constant quality
                            QVBR output, with little or no perceptual decrease
                            in  quality. Or, use to increase the video quality
                            of outputs with other rate control modes  relative
                            to  the bitrate that you specify. Bandwidth reduc-
                            tion increases further  when  your  input  is  low
                            quality  or  noisy.  Outputs that use this feature
                            incur pro-tier pricing. When you include Bandwidth
                            reduction filter, you cannot include the Noise re-
                            ducer preprocessor.

                            Sharpening -> (string)
                               Optionally specify the level of  sharpening  to
                               apply when you use the Bandwidth reduction fil-
                               ter. Sharpening adds contrast to the  edges  of
                               your  video  content  and  can reduce softness.
                               Keep the default value Off to apply no sharpen-
                               ing.  Set Sharpening strength to Low to apply a
                               minimal amount of sharpening, or High to  apply
                               a maximum amount of sharpening.

                            Strength -> (string)
                               Specify the strength of the Bandwidth reduction
                               filter. For most workflows, we  recommend  that
                               you choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of your
                               output with little to no perceptual decrease in
                               video  quality.  For  high quality and high bi-
                               trate outputs, choose Low. For the  most  band-
                               width reduction, choose High. We recommend that
                               you choose High for low bitrate  outputs.  Note
                               that  High  may  incur a slight increase in the
                               softness of your output.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify the average bitrate in  bits  per  second.
                            Required  for  VBR and CBR. For MS Smooth outputs,
                            bitrates must be unique when rounded down  to  the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            Specify  an  H.264  level  that is consistent with
                            your output video settings.  If  you  aren't  sure
                            what level to specify, choose Auto.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            H.264  Profile. High 4:2:2 and 10-bit profiles are
                            only available with the AVC-I License.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow the number of B-frames in
                            your output GOP structure to vary or not depending
                            on your input video content. To improve  the  sub-
                            jective  video  quality  of  your  output that has
                            high-motion content: Leave blank or keep  the  de-
                            fault  value Adaptive. MediaConvert will use fewer
                            B-frames  for  high-motion  video   content   than
                            low-motion  content.  The  maximum  number  of  B-
                            frames is limited by the value that you choose for
                            B-frames between reference frames. To use the same
                            number B-frames for all types of  content:  Choose
                            Static.

                        EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                            Optionally  include or suppress markers at the end
                            of your output that signal the end  of  the  video
                            stream.  To  include  end of stream markers: Leave
                            blank or keep the default value, Include.  To  not
                            include  end  of  stream markers: Choose Suppress.
                            This is useful when your output will  be  inserted
                            into another stream.

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Entropy  encoding mode. Use CABAC (must be in Main
                            or High profile) or CAVLC.

                        FieldEncoding -> (string)
                            The video encoding method for your MPEG-4 AVC out-
                            put.  Keep the default value, PAFF, to have Media-
                            Convert use PAFF encoding for interlaced  outputs.
                            Choose  Force  field  to disable PAFF encoding and
                            create separate interlaced fields. Choose MBAFF to
                            disable  PAFF  and have MediaConvert use MBAFF en-
                            coding for interlaced outputs.

                        FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only use this setting when you change the  default
                            value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion.  When  you  keep  all  defaults,   excluding
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization  and  all  other adaptive
                            quantization from your JSON job specification, Me-
                            diaConvert automatically applies the best types of
                            quantization for your video content. When you  set
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization  to  a  value  other than
                            AUTO, the default value  for  H264FlickerAdaptive-
                            Quantization is Disabled. Change this value to En-
                            abled to reduce I-frame pop. I-frame  pop  appears
                            as  a  visual  flicker that can arise when the en-
                            coder saves bits by copying some macroblocks  many
                            times from frame to frame, and then refreshes them
                            at the I-frame. When you enable this setting,  the
                            encoder  updates  these  macroblocks slightly more
                            often to smooth out the flicker. To  manually  en-
                            able  or  disable H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization,
                            you must set  Adaptive  quantization  to  a  value
                            other than AUTO.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow B-frames to be referenced
                            by  other  frame  types. To use reference B-frames
                            when your GOP structure has 1  or  more  B-frames:
                            Leave  blank or keep the default value Enabled. We
                            recommend that you choose Enabled to help  improve
                            the  video  quality of your output relative to its
                            bitrate. To not  use  reference  B-frames:  Choose
                            Disabled.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  relative frequency of open to closed
                            GOPs in this output. For example, if you  want  to
                            allow  four  open  GOPs  and then require a closed
                            GOP, set this value to 5. We  recommend  that  you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put  video. In the console, do this by keeping the
                            default empty value. If you do explicitly  specify
                            a  value,  for  segmented  outputs, don't set this
                            value to 0.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Use this setting only when you set GOP  mode  con-
                            trol  to  Specified, frames or Specified, seconds.
                            Specify the GOP length using  a  whole  number  of
                            frames or a decimal value of seconds. MediaConvert
                            will interpret this value as frames or seconds de-
                            pending  on the value you choose for GOP mode con-
                            trol. If you want to allow MediaConvert  to  auto-
                            matically determine GOP size, leave GOP size blank
                            and set GOP mode control to Auto. If  your  output
                            group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP size
                            blank and set GOP mode control  to  Auto  in  each
                            output in your output group.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify how the transcoder determines GOP size for
                            this  output.  We  recommend  that  you  have  the
                            transcoder automatically choose this value for you
                            based on characteristics of your input  video.  To
                            enable  this  automatic  behavior, choose Auto and
                            and leave GOP size blank. By default, if you don't
                            specify  GOP  mode  control, MediaConvert will use
                            automatic behavior. If your output group specifies
                            HLS,  DASH,  or CMAF, set GOP mode control to Auto
                            and leave GOP size blank in each  output  in  your
                            output   group.  To  explicitly  specify  the  GOP
                            length, choose  Specified,  frames  or  Specified,
                            seconds and then provide the GOP length in the re-
                            lated setting GOP size.

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If your downstream systems have strict buffer  re-
                            quirements:  Specify the minimum percentage of the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded  video  segment. For the best video quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage  of the buffer that should initially be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use Top field first or Bottom field first to  cre-
                            ate  an  output  that's  interlaced  with the same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or  Follow, default bottom to produce outputs with
                            the same field polarity as the  source.  For  jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity might change over the course  of  the  output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the source is interlaced, the output will  be  in-
                            terlaced  with the same polarity as the source. If
                            the source is progressive, the output will be  in-
                            terlaced  with  top  field bottom field first, de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use this setting only when you also  enable  Scene
                            change  detection. This setting determines how the
                            encoder manages the spacing between I-frames  that
                            it  inserts as part of the I-frame cadence and the
                            I-frames that it inserts for Scene  change  detec-
                            tion.  We  recommend  that you have the transcoder
                            automatically choose this value for you  based  on
                            characteristics  of  your  input  video. To enable
                            this automatic behavior, do this  by  keeping  the
                            default empty value. When you explicitly specify a
                            value for this  setting,  the  encoder  determines
                            whether  to  skip  a cadence-driven I-frame by the
                            value you set. For example, if you set Min  I  in-
                            terval  to  5  and  a cadence-driven I-frame would
                            fall within 5 frames of  a  scene-change  I-frame,
                            then the encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame.
                            In this way, one GOP is shrunk  slightly  and  one
                            GOP is stretched slightly. When the cadence-driven
                            I-frames are farther from the scene-change I-frame
                            than  the  value  you set, then the encoder leaves
                            all I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding the
                            scene  change  are  smaller than the usual cadence
                            GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of B-frames  between  reference
                            frames in this output. For the best video quality:
                            Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines
                            the number of B-frames to use based on the charac-
                            teristics of your input video. To manually specify
                            the  number  of B-frames between reference frames:
                            Enter an integer from 0 to 7.

                        NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use  more  than requested if using B-frames and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault behavior, Follow source, uses the  PAR  from
                            your  input  video  for  your output. To specify a
                            different PAR in the  console,  choose  any  value
                            other  than  Follow source. When you choose SPECI-
                            FIED for this setting, you must also specify  val-
                            ues  for  the parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                            tings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED. On the  console,  this  corresponds  to  any
                            value  other  than Follow source. When you specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC
                            widescreen,  you would specify the ratio 40:33. In
                            this example, the value for parNumerator is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            The Quality tuning level you choose  represents  a
                            trade-off  between  the encoding speed of your job
                            and the output video quality. For the fastest  en-
                            coding  speed at the cost of video quality: Choose
                            Single pass. For a good balance  between  encoding
                            speed  and  video quality: Leave blank or keep the
                            default value Single pass HQ. For the  best  video
                            quality,  at  the  cost  of encoding speed: Choose
                            Multi pass HQ. MediaConvert performs  an  analysis
                            pass  on  your input followed by an encoding pass.
                            Outputs that use this feature incur pro-tier pric-
                            ing.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  for quality-defined variable bitrate en-
                            coding with the H.265 codec.  Use  these  settings
                            only when you set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                            MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when Rate control mode is
                               QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ.
                               For  Max  average  bitrate values suited to the
                               complexity of your  input  video,  the  service
                               limits the average bitrate of the video part of
                               this output to the value that you choose.  That
                               is, the total size of the video element is less
                               than or equal to the value you  set  multiplied
                               by the number of seconds of encoded output.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode to QVBR. Specify the target quality  level
                               for  this  output.  MediaConvert determines the
                               right number of bits to use for  each  part  of
                               the  video  to  maintain the video quality that
                               you specify. When you keep the  default  value,
                               AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks  a quality level for
                               you, based on  characteristics  of  your  input
                               video.  If  you  prefer  to  specify  a quality
                               level, specify a number from 1 through 10.  Use
                               higher  numbers  for  greater quality. Level 10
                               results in  nearly  lossless  compression.  The
                               quality   level   for   most  broadcast-quality
                               transcodes is between 6 and 9.  Optionally,  to
                               specify  a  value  between  whole numbers, also
                               provide  a  value  for  the  setting  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your
                               QVBR quality level to be  7.33,  set  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevel  to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune
                               to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional. Specify a value here to set the  QVBR
                               quality  to  a level that is between whole num-
                               bers. For example, if you want your QVBR  qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert  rounds  your QVBR quality level to the
                               nearest third of a whole number.  For  example,
                               if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your  actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  to specify whether this output
                            has a variable  bitrate  (VBR),  constant  bitrate
                            (CBR) or quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                        RepeatPps -> (string)
                            Places  a PPS header on each encoded picture, even
                            if repeated.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  to create a better quality interlaced out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input  corresponds  to  an interlaced field in the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for  all  other output frame rates. With basic in-
                            terlacing, MediaConvert performs  any  frame  rate
                            conversion  first  and then interlaces the frames.
                            When you choose Optimized interlacing and you  set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically  falls  back  to  basic interlacing. Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must  set  Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use
                            optimized interlacing for hard  telecine  outputs.
                            You  must also set Interlace mode to a value other
                            than Progressive.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable this setting to insert  I-frames  at  scene
                            changes  that  the  service automatically detects.
                            This improves video quality and is enabled by  de-
                            fault. If this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                            detection for further video  quality  improvement.
                            For    more    information    about    QVBR,   see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/cbr-vbr-qvbr.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for  pro-
                            gressive  pictures, and less than or equal to half
                            the number of macroblock rows for interlaced  pic-
                            tures.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate to 25.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with
                            a specification that requires a specific value. If
                            you  don't  have  a  specification requirement, we
                            recommend that you adjust  the  softness  of  your
                            output  by  using  a  lower  value for the setting
                            Sharpness or by enabling a noise  reducer  filter.
                            The  Softness  setting  specifies the quantization
                            matrices that the encoder uses. Keep  the  default
                            value,  0, for flat quantization. Choose the value
                            1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantiza-
                            tion   matricies  from  the  H.264  specification.
                            Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                            polation.  Increasing values from 17 to 128 result
                            in increasing reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                            The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only  use this setting when you change the default
                            value, Auto, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion.   When  you  keep  all  defaults,  excluding
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization and  all  other  adaptive
                            quantization from your JSON job specification, Me-
                            diaConvert automatically applies the best types of
                            quantization  for your video content. When you set
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization to  a  value  other  than
                            AUTO,  the  default value for H264SpatialAdaptive-
                            Quantization is Enabled. Keep this  default  value
                            to  adjust quantization within each frame based on
                            spatial variation of content complexity. When  you
                            enable  this  feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                            on areas that can sustain more distortion with  no
                            noticeable  visual  degradation and uses more bits
                            on areas where any small distortion  will  be  no-
                            ticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are
                            encoded with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks
                            are  encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature
                            will almost always  improve  your  video  quality.
                            Note,  though, that this feature doesn't take into
                            account where the viewer's attention is likely  to
                            be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                            tention on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                            plex texture, you might choose to set H264Spatial-
                            AdaptiveQuantization to Disabled. Related setting:
                            When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set
                            the value for Adaptive quantization  depending  on
                            your  content.  For  homogeneous  content, such as
                            cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For  con-
                            tent  with  a wider variety of textures, set it to
                            High or Higher.  To  manually  enable  or  disable
                            H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization,   you   must  set
                            Adaptive quantization to a value other than AUTO.

                        Syntax -> (string)
                            Produces a bitstream compliant with SMPTE RP-2027.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable  hard or soft telecine to create a smoother
                            picture. Hard telecine produces a  29.97i  output.
                            Soft  telecine  produces  an  output with a 23.976
                            output that signals to the video player device  to
                            do  the conversion during play back. When you keep
                            the default value, None, MediaConvert does a stan-
                            dard  frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing
                            anything with  the  field  polarity  to  create  a
                            smoother picture.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only  use this setting when you change the default
                            value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion.   When  you  keep  all  defaults,  excluding
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization and  all  other  adaptive

                            diaConvert automatically applies the best types of
                            quantization  for your video content. When you set
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization to  a  value  other  than
                            AUTO,  the default value for H264TemporalAdaptive-
                            Quantization is Enabled. Keep this  default  value
                            to  adjust quantization within each frame based on
                            temporal variation of content complexity. When you
                            enable  this  feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                            on areas of the frame that aren't moving and  uses
                            more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that
                            move a lot. For example, this feature improves the
                            readability  of  text  tickers  on  newscasts  and
                            scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this  fea-
                            ture  will  almost always improve your video qual-
                            ity. Note, though, that this feature doesn't  take
                            into  account  where  the  viewer's  attention  is
                            likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing
                            their  attention  on  a  part  of  the screen that
                            doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such
                            as sports athletes' faces, you might choose to set
                            H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization to Disabled.  Re-
                            lated  setting: When you enable temporal quantiza-
                            tion, adjust the strength of the filter  with  the
                            setting  Adaptive quantization. To manually enable
                            or disable  H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization,  you
                            must  set  Adaptive  quantization to a value other
                            than AUTO.

                        UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                            Inserts timecode for each frame as 4 bytes  of  an
                            unregistered SEI message.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            When  you  set  Adaptive  Quantization to Auto, or
                            leave blank,  MediaConvert  automatically  applies
                            quantization  to improve the video quality of your
                            output. Set Adaptive Quantization to Low,  Medium,
                            High,  Higher,  or  Max  to  manually  control the
                            strength of the quantization filter. When you  do,
                            you can specify a value for Spatial Adaptive Quan-
                            tization,  Temporal  Adaptive  Quantization,   and
                            Flicker  Adaptive Quantization, to further control
                            the quantization filter. Set Adaptive Quantization
                            to Off to apply no quantization to your output.

                        AlternateTransferFunctionSei -> (string)
                            Enables  Alternate  Transfer  Function SEI message
                            for outputs using Hybrid  Log  Gamma  (HLG)  Elec-

                        BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                            The Bandwidth reduction filter increases the video
                            quality of your output relative  to  its  bitrate.
                            Use  to lower the bitrate of your constant quality
                            QVBR output, with little or no perceptual decrease
                            in  quality. Or, use to increase the video quality
                            of outputs with other rate control modes  relative
                            to  the bitrate that you specify. Bandwidth reduc-
                            tion increases further  when  your  input  is  low
                            quality  or  noisy.  Outputs that use this feature
                            incur pro-tier pricing. When you include Bandwidth
                            reduction filter, you cannot include the Noise re-
                            ducer preprocessor.

                            Sharpening -> (string)
                               Optionally specify the level of  sharpening  to
                               apply when you use the Bandwidth reduction fil-
                               ter. Sharpening adds contrast to the  edges  of
                               your  video  content  and  can reduce softness.
                               Keep the default value Off to apply no sharpen-
                               ing.  Set Sharpening strength to Low to apply a
                               minimal amount of sharpening, or High to  apply
                               a maximum amount of sharpening.

                            Strength -> (string)
                               Specify the strength of the Bandwidth reduction
                               filter. For most workflows, we  recommend  that
                               you choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of your
                               output with little to no perceptual decrease in
                               video  quality.  For  high quality and high bi-
                               trate outputs, choose Low. For the  most  band-
                               width reduction, choose High. We recommend that
                               you choose High for low bitrate  outputs.  Note
                               that  High  may  incur a slight increase in the
                               softness of your output.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify the average bitrate in  bits  per  second.
                            Required  for  VBR and CBR. For MS Smooth outputs,
                            bitrates must be unique when rounded down  to  the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            H.265 Level.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Represents  the  Profile  and  Tier,  per the HEVC
                            (H.265) specification. Selections are  grouped  as
                            [Profile] / [Tier], so "Main/High" represents Main
                            Profile with High Tier. 4:2:2  profiles  are  only
                            available with the HEVC 4:2:2 License.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow the number of B-frames in
                            your output GOP structure to vary or not depending
                            on  your  input video content. To improve the sub-
                            jective video quality  of  your  output  that  has
                            high-motion  content:  Leave blank or keep the de-
                            fault value Adaptive. MediaConvert will use  fewer
                            B-frames   for   high-motion  video  content  than
                            low-motion  content.  The  maximum  number  of  B-
                            frames is limited by the value that you choose for
                            B-frames between reference frames. To use the same
                            number  B-frames  for all types of content: Choose
                            Static.

                        EndOfStreamMarkers -> (string)
                            Optionally include or suppress markers at the  end
                            of  your  output  that signal the end of the video
                            stream. To include end of  stream  markers:  Leave
                            blank  or  keep the default value, Include. To not
                            include end of stream  markers:  Choose  Suppress.
                            This  is  useful when your output will be inserted
                            into another stream.

                        FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Enable this setting to  have  the  encoder  reduce
                            I-frame  pop.  I-frame  pop  appears  as  a visual
                            flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits
                            by  copying some macroblocks many times from frame
                            to frame, and then refreshes them at the  I-frame.
                            When  you enable this setting, the encoder updates
                            these macroblocks slightly more  often  to  smooth
                            out  the  flicker. This setting is disabled by de-
                            fault. Related setting: In  addition  to  enabling
                            this  setting, you must also set adaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion to a value other than Off.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            Use the Framerate setting  to  specify  the  frame
                            rate for this output. If you want to keep the same
                            frame rate  as  the  input  video,  choose  Follow
                            source.  If  you want to do frame rate conversion,
                            choose a frame rate  from  the  dropdown  list  or
                            choose  Custom.  The framerates shown in the drop-
                            down list are decimal approximations of fractions.
                            If you choose Custom, specify your frame rate as a
                            fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow B-frames to be referenced
                            by other frame types. To  use  reference  B-frames
                            when  your  GOP  structure has 1 or more B-frames:
                            Leave blank or keep the default value Enabled.  We
                            recommend  that you choose Enabled to help improve
                            the video quality of your output relative  to  its
                            bitrate.  To  not  use  reference B-frames: Choose
                            Disabled.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify the relative frequency of open  to  closed
                            GOPs  in  this output. For example, if you want to
                            allow four open GOPs and  then  require  a  closed
                            GOP,  set  this  value to 5. We recommend that you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put video. To enable this automatic  behavior,  do
                            this by keeping the default empty value. If you do
                            explicitly specify a value, for segmented outputs,
                            don't set this value to 0.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Use  this  setting only when you set GOP mode con-
                            trol to Specified, frames or  Specified,  seconds.
                            Specify  the  GOP  length  using a whole number of
                            frames or a decimal value of seconds. MediaConvert
                            will interpret this value as frames or seconds de-
                            pending on the value you choose for GOP mode  con-
                            trol.  If  you want to allow MediaConvert to auto-
                            matically determine GOP size, leave GOP size blank
                            and  set  GOP mode control to Auto. If your output
                            group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP size
                            blank  and  set  GOP  mode control to Auto in each
                            output in your output group.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify how the transcoder determines GOP size for
                            this  output.  We  recommend  that  you  have  the
                            transcoder automatically choose this value for you
                            based  on  characteristics of your input video. To
                            enable this automatic behavior,  choose  Auto  and
                            and leave GOP size blank. By default, if you don't
                            specify GOP mode control,  MediaConvert  will  use
                            automatic behavior. If your output group specifies
                            HLS, DASH, or CMAF, set GOP mode control  to  Auto
                            and  leave  GOP  size blank in each output in your
                            output  group.  To  explicitly  specify  the   GOP
                            length,  choose  Specified,  frames  or Specified,
                            seconds and then provide the GOP length in the re-
                            lated setting GOP size.

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If  your downstream systems have strict buffer re-
                            quirements: Specify the minimum percentage of  the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded video segment. For the best  video  quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage of the buffer that should initially  be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use  Top field first or Bottom field first to cre-
                            ate an output  that's  interlaced  with  the  same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or Follow, default bottom to produce outputs  with
                            the  same  field  polarity as the source. For jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity  might  change  over the course of the output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the  source  is interlaced, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with the same polarity as the source.  If
                            the  source is progressive, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with top field bottom  field  first,  de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting only when you also enable Scene
                            change detection. This setting determines how  the
                            encoder  manages the spacing between I-frames that
                            it inserts as part of the I-frame cadence and  the
                            I-frames  that  it inserts for Scene change detec-
                            tion. We recommend that you  have  the  transcoder
                            automatically  choose  this value for you based on
                            characteristics of your  input  video.  To  enable
                            this  automatic  behavior,  do this by keeping the
                            default empty value. When you explicitly specify a
                            value  for  this  setting,  the encoder determines
                            whether to skip a cadence-driven  I-frame  by  the
                            value  you  set. For example, if you set Min I in-
                            terval to 5 and  a  cadence-driven  I-frame  would
                            fall  within  5  frames of a scene-change I-frame,
                            then the encoder skips the cadence-driven I-frame.
                            In  this  way,  one GOP is shrunk slightly and one
                            GOP is stretched slightly. When the cadence-driven
                            I-frames are farther from the scene-change I-frame
                            than the value you set, then  the  encoder  leaves
                            all I-frames in place and the GOPs surrounding the
                            scene change are smaller than  the  usual  cadence
                            GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  number of B-frames between reference
                            frames in this output. For the best video quality:
                            Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines
                            the number of B-frames to use based on the charac-
                            teristics of your input video. To manually specify
                            the number of B-frames between  reference  frames:
                            Enter an integer from 0 to 7.

                        NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use more than requested if using  B-frames  and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional.  Specify  how the service determines the
                            pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The  de-
                            fault  behavior,  Follow source, uses the PAR from
                            your input video for your  output.  To  specify  a
                            different  PAR, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this  set-
                            ting,  you must also specify values for the parNu-
                            merator and parDenominator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED. On the  console,  this  corresponds  to  any
                            value  other  than Follow source. When you specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC
                            widescreen,  you would specify the ratio 40:33. In
                            this example, the value for parNumerator is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality tuning level to  choose  how
                            you  want  to  trade off encoding speed for output
                            video quality. The  default  behavior  is  faster,
                            lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  for quality-defined variable bitrate en-
                            coding with the H.265 codec.  Use  these  settings
                            only when you set QVBR for Rate control mode.

                            MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when Rate control mode is
                               QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ.
                               For  Max  average  bitrate values suited to the
                               complexity of your  input  video,  the  service
                               limits the average bitrate of the video part of
                               this output to the value that you choose.  That
                               is, the total size of the video element is less
                               than or equal to the value you  set  multiplied
                               by the number of seconds of encoded output.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode to QVBR. Specify the target quality  level
                               for  this  output.  MediaConvert determines the
                               right number of bits to use for  each  part  of
                               the  video  to  maintain the video quality that
                               you specify. When you keep the  default  value,
                               AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks  a quality level for
                               you, based on  characteristics  of  your  input
                               video.  If  you  prefer  to  specify  a quality
                               level, specify a number from 1 through 10.  Use
                               higher  numbers  for  greater quality. Level 10
                               results in  nearly  lossless  compression.  The
                               quality   level   for   most  broadcast-quality
                               transcodes is between 6 and 9.  Optionally,  to
                               specify  a  value  between  whole numbers, also
                               provide  a  value  for  the  setting  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune. For example, if you want your
                               QVBR quality level to be  7.33,  set  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevel  to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune
                               to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional. Specify a value here to set the  QVBR
                               quality  to  a level that is between whole num-
                               bers. For example, if you want your QVBR  qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert  rounds  your QVBR quality level to the
                               nearest third of a whole number.  For  example,
                               if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your  actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  to specify whether this output
                            has a variable  bitrate  (VBR),  constant  bitrate
                            (CBR) or quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                        SampleAdaptiveOffsetFilterMode -> (string)
                            Specify   Sample   Adaptive  Offset  (SAO)  filter
                            strength. Adaptive mode dynamically  selects  best
                            strength based on content

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing to create a better quality interlaced  out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input corresponds to an interlaced  field  in  the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for all other output frame rates. With  basic  in-
                            terlacing,  MediaConvert  performs  any frame rate
                            conversion first and then interlaces  the  frames.
                            When  you choose Optimized interlacing and you set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically falls back  to  basic  interlacing.  Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must set Telecine to None or Soft. You  can't  use
                            optimized  interlacing  for hard telecine outputs.
                            You must also set Interlace mode to a value  other
                            than Progressive.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting  to insert I-frames at scene
                            changes that the  service  automatically  detects.
                            This  improves video quality and is enabled by de-
                            fault. If this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                            detection  for  further video quality improvement.
                            For   more    information    about    QVBR,    see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/cbr-vbr-qvbr.

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal  to  the  number of macroblock rows for pro-
                            gressive pictures, and less than or equal to  half
                            the  number of macroblock rows for interlaced pic-
                            tures.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate
                            is  23.976  or  24 frames per second (fps). Enable
                            slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When  you  en-
                            able  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels the video
                            frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to  keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this setting will slightly reduce the duration  of
                            your  video.  Required settings: You must also set
                            Framerate to 25.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quanti-
                            zation  within  each frame based on spatial varia-
                            tion of content complexity. When you  enable  this
                            feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that
                            can sustain more  distortion  with  no  noticeable
                            visual  degradation  and  uses  more bits on areas
                            where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
                            example,  complex textured blocks are encoded with
                            fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are  encoded
                            with  more bits. Enabling this feature will almost
                            always improve your video quality.  Note,  though,
                            that  this feature doesn't take into account where
                            the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers
                            are  likely  to  be  focusing their attention on a
                            part of the screen with a lot of complex  texture,
                            you  might choose to disable this feature. Related
                            setting: When you enable spatial adaptive  quanti-
                            zation,  set  the  value for Adaptive quantization
                            depending on your content.  For  homogeneous  con-
                            tent,  such as cartoons and video games, set it to
                            Low. For content with a wider variety of textures,
                            set it to High or Higher.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            This  field applies only if the Streams > Advanced
                            > Framerate field is set  to  29.970.  This  field
                            works  with the Streams > Advanced > Preprocessors

                            Interlaced  Mode  field  to identify the scan type
                            for  the  output:  Progressive,  Interlaced,  Hard
                            Telecine or Soft Telecine. - Hard: produces 29.97i
                            output from 23.976 input. - Soft: produces 23.976;
                            the player converts this output to 29.97i.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quanti-
                            zation within each frame based on temporal  varia-
                            tion  of  content complexity. When you enable this
                            feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on  areas  of
                            the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on
                            complex objects with sharp edges that move a  lot.
                            For example, this feature improves the readability
                            of text tickers on newscasts  and  scoreboards  on
                            sports  matches. Enabling this feature will almost
                            always improve your video quality.  Note,  though,
                            that  this feature doesn't take into account where

                            jects  with  sharp edges, such as sports athletes'
                            faces, you might choose to disable  this  feature.
                            Related  setting: When you enable temporal quanti-
                            zation, adjust the strength of the filter with the
                            setting Adaptive quantization.

                        TemporalIds -> (string)
                            Enables  temporal layer identifiers in the encoded
                            bitstream. Up to 3 layers are supported  depending
                            on  GOP structure: I- and P-frames form one layer,
                            reference B-frames can form  a  second  layer  and
                            non-reference b-frames can form a third layer. De-
                            coders can optionally decode only the lower tempo-
                            ral  layers to generate a lower frame rate output.
                            For example, given a bitstream with  temporal  IDs
                            and with b-frames = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display order),
                            a decoder could decode all  the  frames  for  full
                            frame rate output or only the I and P frames (low-
                            est temporal layer) for a half frame rate output.

                        Tiles -> (string)
                            Enable use of tiles, allowing horizontal  as  well
                            as vertical subdivision of the encoded pictures.

                        UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                            Inserts  timecode  for each frame as 4 bytes of an
                            unregistered SEI message.

                        WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                            If the location of parameter set NAL units doesn't
                            matter  in your workflow, ignore this setting. Use
                            this setting only with CMAF or  DASH  outputs,  or
                            with  standalone  file  outputs  in an MPEG-4 con-
                            tainer (MP4 outputs). Choose  HVC1  to  mark  your
                            output  as  HVC1. This makes your output compliant
                            with the following specification: ISO IECJTC1 SC29
                            N13798 Text ISO/IEC FDIS 14496-15 3rd Edition. For
                            these outputs, the service  stores  parameter  set
                            NAL  units  in  the  sample headers but not in the
                            samples directly. For MP4 outputs, when you choose
                            HVC1,  your  output  video might not work properly
                            with some downstream systems  and  video  players.
                            The  service  defaults  to  marking your output as
                            HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes param-
                            eter set NAL units directly into the samples.

                     Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value MPEG2.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Specify  the strength of any adaptive quantization
                            filters that you enable. The value that you choose
                            here  applies  to  the following settings: Spatial
                            adaptive quantization, and Temporal adaptive quan-
                            tization.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  average  bitrate in bits per second.
                            Required for VBR and CBR. For MS  Smooth  outputs,
                            bitrates  must  be unique when rounded down to the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            Use Level to set the MPEG-2 level  for  the  video
                            output.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Use  Profile  to  set  the  MPEG-2 profile for the
                            video output.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Choose Adaptive to improve subjective video  qual-
                            ity  for  high-motion content. This will cause the
                            service to use fewer B-frames (which infer  infor-
                            mation based on other frames) for high-motion por-
                            tions of the video and more B-frames  for  low-mo-
                            tion  portions.  The maximum number of B-frames is
                            limited by the value you provide for the setting B
                            frames between reference frames.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify the relative frequency of open  to  closed
                            GOPs  in  this output. For example, if you want to
                            allow four open GOPs and  then  require  a  closed
                            GOP,  set  this  value  to  5.  When  you create a
                            streaming output, we recommend that you  keep  the
                            default   value,   1,  so  that  players  starting
                            mid-stream receive an IDR frame as quickly as pos-
                            sible. Don't set this value to 0; that would break
                            output segmenting.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Specify the interval between keyframes, in seconds
                            or  frames,  for  this output. Default: 12 Related
                            settings: When you specify the GOP  size  in  sec-
                            onds,  set GOP mode control to Specified, seconds.
                            The default value for GOP mode control is Frames.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify the units for GOP size. If you don't spec-
                            ify  a value here, by default the encoder measures
                            GOP size in frames.

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If your downstream systems have strict buffer  re-
                            quirements:  Specify the minimum percentage of the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded  video  segment. For the best video quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage  of the buffer that should initially be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use Top field first or Bottom field first to  cre-
                            ate  an  output  that's  interlaced  with the same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or  Follow, default bottom to produce outputs with
                            the same field polarity as the  source.  For  jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity might change over the course  of  the  output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the source is interlaced, the output will  be  in-
                            terlaced  with the same polarity as the source. If
                            the source is progressive, the output will be  in-
                            terlaced  with  top  field bottom field first, de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                            Use Intra DC precision to set quantization  preci-
                            sion  for  intra-block  DC  coefficients.  If  you
                            choose the value auto, the service will  automati-
                            cally  select the precision based on the per-frame
                            compression ratio.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting only when you also enable Scene
                            change detection. This setting determines how  the
                            encoder  manages the spacing between I-frames that
                            it inserts as part of the I-frame cadence and  the
                            I-frames  that  it inserts for Scene change detec-
                            tion. When you specify a value for  this  setting,
                            the  encoder  determines  whether  to  skip  a ca-
                            dence-driven I-frame by the value you set. For ex-
                            ample,  if  you  set Min I interval to 5 and a ca-
                            dence-driven I-frame would fall within 5 frames of
                            a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder skips the
                            cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,  one  GOP  is
                            shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly.
                            When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther  from
                            the  scene-change  I-frame than the value you set,
                            then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place  and
                            the  GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller
                            than the usual cadence GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of B-frames  that  MediaConvert
                            puts  between  reference  frames  in  this output.
                            Valid values are whole numbers from 0  through  7.
                            When  you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert de-
                            faults to 2.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault behavior, Follow source, uses the  PAR  from
                            your  input  video  for  your output. To specify a
                            different PAR in the  console,  choose  any  value
                            other  than  Follow source. When you choose SPECI-
                            FIED for this setting, you must also specify  val-
                            ues  for  the parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                            tings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED. On the  console,  this  corresponds  to  any
                            value  other  than Follow source. When you specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC
                            widescreen,  you would specify the ratio 40:33. In
                            this example, the value for parNumerator is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality tuning level to  choose  how
                            you  want  to  trade off encoding speed for output
                            video quality. The  default  behavior  is  faster,
                            lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use  Rate  control mode to specify whether the bi-
                            trate is variable (vbr) or constant (cbr).

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  to create a better quality interlaced out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input  corresponds  to  an interlaced field in the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for  all  other output frame rates. With basic in-
                            terlacing, MediaConvert performs  any  frame  rate
                            conversion  first  and then interlaces the frames.
                            When you choose Optimized interlacing and you  set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically  falls  back  to  basic interlacing. Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must  set  Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use
                            optimized interlacing for hard  telecine  outputs.
                            You  must also set Interlace mode to a value other
                            than Progressive.

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable this setting to insert  I-frames  at  scene
                            changes  that  the  service automatically detects.
                            This improves video quality and is enabled by  de-
                            fault.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate to 25.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with
                            a specification that requires a specific value. If
                            you  don't  have  a  specification requirement, we
                            recommend that you adjust  the  softness  of  your
                            output  by  using  a  lower  value for the setting
                            Sharpness or by enabling a noise  reducer  filter.
                            The  Softness  setting  specifies the quantization
                            matrices that the encoder uses. Keep  the  default
                            value,  0, to use the AWS Elemental default matri-
                            ces. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to  use  planar
                            interpolation.  Increasing  values  from 17 to 128
                            result in increasing reduction  of  high-frequency
                            data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quanti-
                            zation within each frame based on  spatial  varia-
                            tion  of  content complexity. When you enable this
                            feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that
                            can  sustain  more  distortion  with no noticeable
                            visual degradation and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                            where any small distortion will be noticeable. For
                            example, complex textured blocks are encoded  with
                            fewer  bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded
                            with more bits. Enabling this feature will  almost
                            always  improve  your video quality. Note, though,
                            that this feature doesn't take into account  where
                            the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers
                            are likely to be focusing  their  attention  on  a
                            part  of the screen with a lot of complex texture,
                            you might choose to disable this feature.  Related
                            setting:  When you enable spatial adaptive quanti-
                            zation, set the value  for  Adaptive  quantization
                            depending  on  your  content. For homogeneous con-
                            tent, such as cartoons and video games, set it  to
                            Low. For content with a wider variety of textures,
                            set it to High or Higher.

                        Syntax -> (string)
                            Specify whether this output's video uses  the  D10
                            syntax. Keep the default value to not use the syn-
                            tax. Related settings: When  you  choose  D10  for
                            your  MXF profile, you must also set this value to
                            D10.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable  hard or soft telecine to create a smoother
                            picture. Hard telecine produces a  29.97i  output.
                            Soft  telecine  produces  an  output with a 23.976
                            output that signals to the video player device  to
                            do  the conversion during play back. When you keep
                            the default value, None, MediaConvert does a stan-
                            dard  frame rate conversion to 29.97 without doing
                            anything with  the  field  polarity  to  create  a
                            smoother picture.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled, to adjust quanti-
                            zation within each frame based on temporal  varia-
                            tion  of  content complexity. When you enable this
                            feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on  areas  of
                            the frame that aren't moving and uses more bits on
                            complex objects with sharp edges that move a  lot.
                            For example, this feature improves the readability
                            of text tickers on newscasts  and  scoreboards  on
                            sports  matches. Enabling this feature will almost
                            always improve your video quality.  Note,  though,
                            that  this feature doesn't take into account where
                            the viewer's attention is likely to be. If viewers
                            are  likely  to  be  focusing their attention on a

                            jects  with  sharp edges, such as sports athletes'
                            faces, you might choose to disable  this  feature.
                            Related  setting: When you enable temporal quanti-
                            zation, adjust the strength of the filter with the

                     ProresSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value PRORES.

                        ChromaSampling -> (string)
                            This  setting  applies  only  to  ProRes  4444 and
                            ProRes 4444 XQ outputs that you create from inputs
                            that use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Preserve 4:4:4
                            sampling to allow outputs to also use 4:4:4 chroma
                            sampling.  You  must specify a value for this set-
                            ting when your output codec profile supports 4:4:4
                            chroma   sampling.  Related  Settings:  For  Apple
                            ProRes outputs with 4:4:4 chroma sampling:  Choose
                            Preserve  4:4:4  sampling. Use when your input has
                            4:4:4 chroma sampling and your output  codec  Pro-
                            file  is  Apple  ProRes 4444 or 4444 XQ. Note that
                            when you choose Preserve 4:4:4 sampling, you  can-
                            not  include  any  of the following Preprocessors:
                            Dolby Vision, HDR10+, or Noise reducer.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Use Profile to specify the type  of  Apple  ProRes
                            codec to use for this output.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive to create a progressive
                            output, regardless of the scan type of your input.
                            Use  Top field first or Bottom field first to cre-
                            ate an output  that's  interlaced  with  the  same
                            field polarity throughout. Use Follow, default top
                            or Follow, default bottom to produce outputs  with
                            the  same  field  polarity as the source. For jobs
                            that have multiple inputs, the output field polar-
                            ity  might  change  over the course of the output.
                            Follow behavior depends on the input scan type. If
                            the  source  is interlaced, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with the same polarity as the source.  If
                            the  source is progressive, the output will be in-
                            terlaced with top field bottom  field  first,  de-
                            pending on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional.  Specify  how the service determines the
                            pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The  de-
                            fault  behavior,  Follow source, uses the PAR from
                            your input video for your  output.  To  specify  a
                            different  PAR, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this  set-
                            ting,  you must also specify values for the parNu-
                            merator and parDenominator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED. On the  console,  this  corresponds  to  any
                            value  other  than Follow source. When you specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC
                            widescreen,  you would specify the ratio 40:33. In
                            this example, the value for parNumerator is 40.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  to create a better quality interlaced out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input  corresponds  to  an interlaced field in the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for  all  other output frame rates. With basic in-
                            terlacing, MediaConvert performs  any  frame  rate
                            conversion  first  and then interlaces the frames.
                            When you choose Optimized interlacing and you  set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically  falls  back  to  basic interlacing. Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must  set  Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use
                            optimized interlacing for hard  telecine  outputs.
                            You  must also set Interlace mode to a value other
                            than Progressive.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate
                            is  23.976  or  24 frames per second (fps). Enable
                            slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When  you  en-
                            able  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels the video
                            frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio to  keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this setting will slightly reduce the duration  of
                            your  video.  Required settings: You must also set
                            Framerate to 25.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable hard telecine to create a smoother picture.
                            When you keep the default value,  None,  MediaCon-
                            vert  does  a  standard  frame  rate conversion to
                            29.97 without doing anything with the field polar-
                            ity to create a smoother picture.

                     Vc3Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value VC3

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Optional. Choose the scan line type for this  out-
                            put.  If  you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            will create a progressive output.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  to create a better quality interlaced out-
                            put. In this case, each progressive frame from the
                            input  corresponds  to  an interlaced field in the
                            output. Keep the default value, Basic interlacing,
                            for  all  other output frame rates. With basic in-
                            terlacing, MediaConvert performs  any  frame  rate
                            conversion  first  and then interlaces the frames.
                            When you choose Optimized interlacing and you  set
                            your output frame rate to a value that isn't suit-
                            able for optimized interlacing, MediaConvert auto-
                            matically  falls  back  to  basic interlacing. Re-
                            quired settings: To use optimized interlacing, you
                            must  set  Telecine to None or Soft. You can't use
                            optimized interlacing for hard  telecine  outputs.
                            You  must also set Interlace mode to a value other
                            than Progressive.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate
                            is  23.976  or  24 frames per second (fps). Enable
                            slow PAL to create a 25 fps output  by  relabeling
                            the  video  frames and resampling your audio. Note
                            that enabling this setting  will  slightly  reduce
                            the  duration of your video. Related settings: You
                            must also set Framerate to 25.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable hard telecine to create a smoother picture.
                            When you keep the default value,  None,  MediaCon-

                        Vc3Class -> (string)
                            Specify  the VC3 class to choose the quality char-
                            acteristics for this output. VC3  class,  together

                            and framerateDenominator) and  Resolution  (height
                            and width), determine your output bitrate. For ex-
                            ample, say that your video resolution is 1920x1080
                            and  your framerate is 29.97. Then Class 145 gives

                            Mbps and Class 220 gives you and output with a bi-
                            trate of approximately 220 Mbps.  VC3  class  also
                            specifies the color bit depth of your output.

                     Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value VP8.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Target  bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console,  use  the  Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown in the dropdown list are decimal  approxima-
                            tions  of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must be
                            greater than zero.

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Optional. Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                            bits. For example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this  setting  unless  you set qualityTun-
                            ingLevel to MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the max-
                            imum  bitrate  in  bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.  The  default
                            behavior uses twice the target bitrate as the max-
                            imum bitrate.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault behavior, Follow source, uses the  PAR  from
                            your  input  video  for  your output. To specify a
                            different PAR in the  console,  choose  any  value
                            other  than  Follow source. When you choose SPECI-
                            FIED for this setting, you must also specify  val-
                            ues  for  the parNumerator and parDenominator set-
                            tings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED. On the  console,  this  corresponds  to  any
                            value  other  than Follow source. When you specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC
                            widescreen,  you would specify the ratio 40:33. In
                            this example, the value for parNumerator is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality tuning level to  choose  how
                            you  want  to  trade off encoding speed for output
                            video quality. The  default  behavior  is  faster,
                            lower quality, multi-pass encoding.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            With  the VP8 codec, you can use only the variable
                            bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                     Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you set Codec to the value VP9.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Target bitrate in bits/second. For example,  enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.

                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional.  Specify  how the service determines the
                            pixel aspect ratio for this  output.  The  default

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio to SPECI-
                            FIED.  On  the  console,  this  corresponds to any
                            value other than Follow source. When  you  specify
                            an output pixel aspect ratio (PAR) that is differ-
                            ent from your input video PAR, provide your output
                            PAR  as  a  ratio.  For  example,  for  D1/DV NTSC
                            widescreen, you would specify the ratio 40:33.  In
                            this example, the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            types of quantization for your video content. When
                            you want to apply your quantization settings manu-
                            ally, you must  set  Adaptive  quantization  to  a
                            value other than Auto. Use this setting to specify
                            the strength of any adaptive quantization  filters
                            that you enable. If you don't want MediaConvert to
                            do any adaptive quantization  in  this  transcode,
                            set  Adaptive  quantization  to  Off. Related set-

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Optional. Choose a specific entropy encoding  mode
                            only  when  you  want to override XAVC recommenda-
                            tions. If you choose the value auto,  MediaConvert
                            uses  the mode that the XAVC file format specifies
                            given this output's operating point.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console, use the  Frame  rate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the  dropdown  list.  The  framerates shown in the
                            dropdown list are decimal approximations of  frac-
                            tions.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Frame  rate. In this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            Specify the XAVC profile for this output. For more
                            information,   see   the   Sony  documentation  at
                            https://www.xavc-info.org/. Note that MediaConvert
                            doesn't  support the interlaced video XAVC operat-
                            ing points for XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG. To create an in-
                            terlaced XAVC output, choose the profile XAVC_HD.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output by relabeling
                            the video frames and resampling your  audio.  Note
                            that  enabling  this  setting will slightly reduce
                            the duration of your video. Related settings:  You
                            must also set Frame rate to 25.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your downstream work-
                            flow requires that you specify it explicitly. Oth-
                            erwise,  we recommend that you adjust the softness
                            of your output by using a lower value for the set-
                            ting Sharpness or by enabling a noise reducer fil-
                            ter. The Softness setting specifies the  quantiza-
                            tion  matrices that the encoder uses. Keep the de-
                            fault value, 0, for flat quantization. Choose  the
                            value  1  or  16  to use the default JVT softening
                            quantization matricies from the  H.264  specifica-
                            tion.  Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar
                            interpolation. Increasing values from  17  to  128
                            result  in  increasing reduction of high-frequency
                            data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to
                            keep  the  default  value,  Auto,  for the setting
                            Adaptive quantization. When you do  so,  MediaCon-
                            vert automatically applies the best types of quan-
                            tization for your video content. Include this set-
                            ting  in your JSON job specification only when you
                            choose to change the default  value  for  Adaptive
                            quantization.  For  this setting, keep the default
                            value, Enabled, to adjust quantization within each
                            frame  based  on spatial variation of content com-
                            plexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder
                            uses  fewer  bits  on  areas that can sustain more
                            distortion with no noticeable  visual  degradation
                            and  uses  more bits on areas where any small dis-
                            tortion will be noticeable. For  example,  complex
                            textured  blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and
                            smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                            Enabling  this  feature will almost always improve
                            your video quality. Note, though, that  this  fea-
                            ture  doesn't take into account where the viewer's
                            attention is likely to be. If viewers  are  likely
                            to  be  focusing  their attention on a part of the
                            screen with a lot of complex  texture,  you  might
                            choose  to  disable this feature. Related setting:
                            When you enable spatial adaptive quantization, set
                            the  value  for Adaptive quantization depending on
                            your content. For  homogeneous  content,  such  as
                            cartoons  and video games, set it to Low. For con-
                            tent with a wider variety of textures, set  it  to
                            High or Higher.

                            uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that  aren't
                            moving  and uses more bits on complex objects with
                            sharp edges that move a  lot.  For  example,  this
                            feature  improves  the readability of text tickers
                            on newscasts and scoreboards  on  sports  matches.
                            Enabling  this  feature will almost always improve

                               value  for  Adaptive  quantization. Enable this
                               setting to have the encoder reduce I-frame pop.
                               I-frame  pop  appears  as a visual flicker that
                               can arise when the encoder saves bits by  copy-
                               ing  some  macroblocks many times from frame to
                               frame, and then refreshes them at the  I-frame.
                               When  you  enable this setting, the encoder up-
                               dates these macroblocks slightly more often  to
                               smooth  out  the  flicker. This setting is dis-
                               abled by default. Related setting: In  addition
                               to  enabling  this  setting,  you must also set
                               Adaptive quantization to a value other than Off
                               or  Auto.  Use  Adaptive quantization to adjust
                               the degree of smoothing that  Flicker  adaptive
                               quantization provides.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  the  encoder uses B-frames as
                               reference frames for other pictures in the same
                               GOP.  Choose  Allow to allow the encoder to use
                               B-frames as reference frames. Choose Don't  al-
                               low  to prevent the encoder from using B-frames
                               as reference frames.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applica-
                               tions,  it is recommended that this be set to 1
                               so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an
                               IDR  frame as quickly as possible. Setting this
                               value to 0 will break output segmenting.

                               Specify the size of the buffer  that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses in the HRD buffer model for this out-
                               put. Specify this value in bits;  for  example,
                               enter  five megabits as 5000000. When you don't
                               set this value, or you set it to  zero,  Media-
                               Convert  calculates the default by doubling the
                               bitrate of this output point.

                               Optional. Use Quality tuning  level  to  choose
                               how  you  want  to trade off encoding speed for
                               output video quality. The default  behavior  is
                               faster, lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-

                               Specify the XAVC Intra HD (CBG)  Class  to  set
                               the bitrate of your output. Outputs of the same
                               class have similar image quality over the oper-
                               ating points that are valid for that class.

                            BitrateClass -> (string)
                               Specify the XAVC HD (Long GOP) Bitrate Class to
                               set  the bitrate of your output. Outputs of the
                               same class have similar image quality over  the
                               operating points that are valid for that class.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive to create a pro-
                               gressive output, regardless of the scan type of
                               your input. Use Top field first or Bottom field
                               first  to  create  an  output that's interlaced
                               with the same field  polarity  throughout.  Use
                               Follow,  default  top or Follow, default bottom
                               to produce outputs with the same field polarity
                               as  the source. For jobs that have multiple in-
                               puts, the output field  polarity  might  change
                               over  the course of the output. Follow behavior
                               depends on the input scan type. If  the  source
                               is  interlaced,  the  output will be interlaced
                               with the same polarity as the  source.  If  the
                               source  is  progressive, the output will be in-
                               terlaced with top field bottom field first, de-
                               pending  on  which  of  the  Follow options you

                     Choose  Insert for this setting to include color metadata
                     in this output. Choose Ignore to exclude  color  metadata
                     from  this output. If you don't specify a value, the ser-
                     vice sets this to Insert by default.

                 Crop -> (structure)
                     Use Cropping selection to specify the video area that the
                     service will include in the output video frame.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left edge of the video frame. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top edge of the video frame. Specify  only  even  num-
                        bers.

                 DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                     Applies  only  to 29.97 fps outputs. When this feature is
                     enabled, the service will use drop-frame timecode on out-
                     puts.  If  it is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                     the system will fall back to non-drop-frame. This setting
                     is enabled by default when Timecode insertion is enabled.

                 FixedAfd -> (integer)
                     Applies only if you set AFD Signaling to Fixed. Use Fixed
                     to specify a four-bit AFD value which  the  service  will
                     write on all frames of this video output.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Use Height to define the video resolution height, in pix-
                     els, for this output. To use the same resolution as  your
                     input: Leave both Width and Height blank. To evenly scale
                     from your input resolution: Leave Height blank and  enter
                     a  value  for  Width.  For  example,  if  your  input  is
                     1920x1080 and you set Width to 1280, your output will  be
                     1280x720.

                 Position -> (structure)
                     Use  Selection placement to define the video area in your
                     output frame. The area outside of the rectangle that  you
                     specify here is black.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left edge of the video frame. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top edge of the video frame. Specify  only  even  num-
                        bers.

                 RespondToAfd -> (string)
                     Use Respond to AFD to specify how the service changes the

                 ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                     Specify the video Scaling behavior when your output has a
                     different  resolution  than your input. For more informa-
                     tion,                                                 see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-scaling.html

                 Sharpness -> (integer)
                     Use  Sharpness  setting  to  specify  the   strength   of
                     anti-aliasing.  This  setting  changes  the  width of the
                     anti-alias filter kernel used for scaling. Sharpness only
                     applies  if your output resolution is different from your
                     input resolution. 0  is  the  softest  setting,  100  the
                     sharpest, and 50 recommended for most content.

                 TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                     Applies  only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs.
                     Only enable Timecode insertion when the input frame  rate
                     is  identical  to the output frame rate. To include time-
                     codes in this output, set Timecode insertion to  PIC_TIM-
                     ING_SEI.  To  leave them out, set it to DISABLED. Default
                     is DISABLED. When the service  inserts  timecodes  in  an
                     output,  by  default, it uses any embedded timecodes from
                     the input. If none are present, the service will set  the
                     timecode  for  the  first output frame to zero. To change
                     this default behavior, adjust the settings under Timecode
                     configuration. In the console, these settings are located
                     under Job > Job settings > Timecode configuration. Note -
                     Timecode  source under input settings does not affect the
                     timecodes that are inserted in the output.  Source  under
                     Job settings > Timecode configuration does.

                 VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)
                     Find additional transcoding features under Preprocessors.
                     Enable the features at each  output  individually.  These
                     features are disabled by default.

                     ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                        Use  these  settings  to convert the color space or to
                        modify properties such as hue and  contrast  for  this

                               any YUV values that,  when  converted  to  RGB,
                               would  be  outside the upper tolerance that you
                               specify. Enter an integer from 90 to 105 as  an
                               offset   percentage  to  the  maximum  possible
                               value. Leave blank to  use  the  default  value
                               100.  When  you specify a value for Maximum RGB
                               tolerance, you must set Sample range conversion
                               to Limited range clip.

                               940. The value that you enter applies to 10-bit
                               ranges. For 8-bit ranges, MediaConvert automat-
                               ically scales this value down. When you specify
                               a  value  for  Maximum YUV, you must set Sample
                               range conversion to Limited range clip.

                            MinimumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                               Specify the Minimum RGB color sample range tol-

                        ColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                            Specify the color space you want for this  output.
                            The  service  supports conversion between HDR for-
                            mats, between SDR formats, from SDR  to  HDR,  and
                            from HDR to SDR. SDR to HDR conversion doesn't up-
                            grade the dynamic range. The converted  video  has
                            an HDR format, but visually appears the same as an
                            unconverted output. HDR  to  SDR  conversion  uses
                            tone  mapping  to approximate the outcome of manu-
                            ally regrading from HDR to SDR. When  you  specify
                            an  output color space, MediaConvert uses the fol-
                            lowing color space metadata, which includes  color
                            primaries,  transfer  characteristics,  and matrix

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings when you convert to the HDR  10
                            color  space.  Specify the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering

                            signaled  in the output. These values don't affect
                            the pixel values that are  encoded  in  the  video
                            stream.  They  are intended to help the downstream
                            video player display content in  a  way  that  re-
                            flects  the intentions of the the content creator.
                            When you set Color space  conversion  to  HDR  10,
                            these  settings  are required. You must set values
                            for Max frame average light level and Max  content
                            light  level;  these settings don't have a default
                            value. The default values for  the  other  HDR  10
                            metadata  settings  are defined by the P3D65 color

                        HdrToSdrToneMapper -> (string)
                            Specify  how MediaConvert maps brightness and col-
                            ors from your HDR input to your  SDR  output.  The
                            mode that you select represents a creative choice,
                            with different tradeoffs in the details and  tones
                            of  your  output. To maintain details in bright or
                            saturated areas of your  output:  Choose  Preserve
                            details.  For  some  sources,  your SDR output may
                            look less bright and less saturated when  compared
                            to your HDR source. MediaConvert automatically ap-
                            plies this mode for  HLG  sources,  regardless  of
                            your  choice.  For  a bright and saturated output:
                            Choose Vibrant. We recommend that you choose  this
                            mode when any of your source content is HDR10, and
                            for the best results when it is mastered for  1000
                            nits.  You may notice loss of details in bright or
                            saturated areas of your output. HDR  to  SDR  tone
                            mapping has no effect when your input is SDR.

                        Hue -> (integer)
                            Hue in degrees.

                        SampleRangeConversion -> (string)
                            Specify  how  MediaConvert limits the color sample
                            range for this output. To create a  limited  range
                            output  from  a  full  range input: Choose Limited
                            range squeeze. For full range inputs, MediaConvert
                            performs  a linear offset to color samples equally
                            across all pixels and  frames.  Color  samples  in
                            10-bit  outputs are limited to 64 through 940, and
                            8-bit outputs are limited to 16 through 235. Note:
                            For limited range inputs, values for color samples
                            are passed through to your output unchanged. Medi-
                            aConvert  does not limit the sample range. To cor-
                            rect pixels in your input that are out of range or
                            out  of  gamut: Choose Limited range clip. Use for
                            broadcast applications. MediaConvert conforms  any
                            pixels  outside of the values that you specify un-
                            der Minimum YUV and Maximum YUV to  limited  range
                            bounds.  MediaConvert also corrects any YUV values
                            that, when converted to RGB, would be outside  the
                            bounds you specify under Minimum RGB tolerance and
                            Maximum RGB tolerance. With either  limited  range
                            conversion,  MediaConvert  writes the sample range
                            metadata in the output.

                        Saturation -> (integer)
                            Saturation level.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify the reference white level,  in  nits,  for
                            all  of your SDR inputs. Use to correct brightness
                            levels within HDR10 outputs. The  following  color
                            metadata  must be present in your SDR input: color
                            primaries, transfer  characteristics,  and  matrix
                            coefficients.  If your SDR input has missing color
                            metadata, or if you want to  correct  input  color
                            metadata,  manually  specify  a color space in the
                            input video selector. For 1,000 nit  peak  bright-
                            ness  displays, we recommend that you set SDR ref-
                            erence white level  to  203  (according  to  ITU-R
                            BT.2408).  Leave blank to use the default value of
                            100, or specify an integer from 100 to 1000.

                     Deinterlacer -> (structure)
                        Use the deinterlacer to produce smoother motion and  a
                        clearer    picture.    For   more   information,   see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-scan-type.html.

                        Algorithm -> (string)
                            Only  applies  when  you  set  Deinterlace mode to
                            Deinterlace  or  Adaptive.  Interpolate   produces
                            sharper  pictures,  while  blend produces smoother
                            motion. If your source  file  includes  a  ticker,
                            such  as a scrolling headline at the bottom of the
                            frame: Choose Interpolate ticker or Blend  ticker.
                            To  apply field doubling: Choose Linear interpola-
                            tion. Note that Linear interpolation may introduce
                            video artifacts into your output.

                        Control -> (string)

                            o When  set  to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer
                              does not convert frames that are tagged in meta-
                              data  as progressive. It will only convert those
                              that are tagged as some other type. -  When  set
                              to  FORCE_ALL_FRAMES,  the deinterlacer converts
                              every frame to progressive - even those that are
                              already  tagged  as progressive. Turn Force mode
                              on only if there is a good chance that the meta-
                              data  has tagged frames as progressive when they
                              are not progressive. Do not turn  on  otherwise;
                              processing  frames  that are already progressive
                              into progressive will probably result  in  lower
                              quality video.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            Use Deinterlacer to choose how the service will do
                            deinterlacing. Default is Deinterlace. -  Deinter-
                            lace converts interlaced to progressive. - Inverse
                            telecine converts Hard Telecine 29.97i to progres-
                            sive 23.976p. - Adaptive auto-detects and converts
                            to progressive.

                     DolbyVision -> (structure)
                        Enable Dolby Vision feature to  produce  Dolby  Vision
                        compatible video output.

                        L6Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use  these  settings  when  you  set  DolbyVision-
                            Level6Mode to SPECIFY to override the  MaxCLL  and
                            MaxFALL values in your input with new values.

                            MaxCll -> (integer)
                               Maximum  Content  Light Level. Static HDR meta-
                               data that corresponds to the brightest pixel in
                               the entire stream. Measured in nits.

                            MaxFall -> (integer)
                               Maximum  Frame-Average  Light Level. Static HDR
                               metadata  that  corresponds  to   the   highest
                               frame-average  brightness in the entire stream.
                               Measured in nits.

                        L6Mode -> (string)
                            Use Dolby Vision Mode to choose  how  the  service
                            will   handle  Dolby  Vision  MaxCLL  and  MaxFALL
                            properies.

                        Mapping -> (string)
                            Required when you set Dolby Vision Profile to Pro-
                            file  8.1.  When  you set Content mapping to None,
                            content mapping is not applied to  the  HDR10-com-
                            patible  signal.  Depending on the source peak nit
                            level, clipping might occur on HDR devices without
                            Dolby  Vision.  When  you  set  Content mapping to
                            HDR10 1000, the transcoder creates  a  1,000  nits
                            peak  HDR10-compatible  signal  by applying static
                            content  mapping  to  the  source.  This  mode  is
                            speed-optimized  for  PQ10  sources  with metadata
                            that is created from analysis.  For  graded  Dolby
                            Vision  content,  be  aware  that  creative intent
                            might not be guaranteed with  extreme  1,000  nits
                            trims.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            Required when you enable Dolby Vision. Use Profile
                            5 to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vision  meta-
                            data in your output. Your input must include Dolby
                            Vision metadata or an HDR10 YUV color  space.  Use
                            Profile 8.1 to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vi-
                            sion metadata and HDR10 metadata in  your  output.
                            Your input must include Dolby Vision metadata.

                     Hdr10Plus -> (structure)
                        Enable HDR10+ analysis and metadata injection. Compat-
                        ible with HEVC only.

                        MasteringMonitorNits -> (integer)
                            Specify the HDR10+  mastering  display  normalized
                            peak  luminance,  in  nits. This is the normalized
                            actual peak luminance of the mastering display, as
                            defined by ST 2094-40.

                        TargetMonitorNits -> (integer)
                            Specify the HDR10+ target display nominal peak lu-
                            minance, in nits. This is the nominal maximum  lu-
                            minance  of  the  target  display as defined by ST
                            2094-40.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the Image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay  on your video. Enable or disable this feature
                        for each output individually. This setting is disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify  the  images  that  you want to overlay on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These settings  apply  to  a  specific  graphic
                               overlay.  You  can include multiple overlays in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify the time, in milliseconds, for  the
                                   image  to  remain on the output video. This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify  for  the  image insertion and the time
                                   that the image  appears  at  full  opacity.
                                   Full  opacity is the level that you specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for Fade-in, the image will ap-
                                   pear abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds,  between the end of the time that you
                                   have specified for the image overlay  Dura-
                                   tion  and when the overlaid image has faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear abruptly at the end  of  the  inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger  than  the  video resolution height,
                                   the service will crop your  overlaid  image
                                   to fit. To use the native height of the im-
                                   age, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion  of the image that you want to overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the overlaid image and the top edge of  the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify how overlapping inserted images ap-
                                   pear.  Images  with higher values for Layer
                                   appear on top of images with  lower  values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use  Opacity to specify how much of the un-
                                   derlying video shows through  the  inserted
                                   image.  0  is  transparent and 100 is fully
                                   opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify the timecode of the frame that  you
                                   want  the  overlay to first appear on. This
                                   must  be  in   timecode   (HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF)  format. Remember to take into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify the width of the inserted image  in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service  will  crop  your overlaid image to
                                   fit. To use the native width of the  image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  reference  white level, in nits, for
                            all of your image inserter images. Use to  correct
                            brightness  levels within HDR10 outputs. For 1,000
                            nit peak brightness displays,  we  recommend  that
                            you  set SDR reference white level to 203 (accord-
                            ing to ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank to use the  de-
                            fault value of 100, or specify an integer from 100
                            to 1000.

                     NoiseReducer -> (structure)
                        Enable the Noise reducer feature to remove noise  from
                        your video output if necessary. Enable or disable this
                        feature for each output individually. This setting  is
                        disabled  by  default.  When you enable Noise reducer,
                        you must also select a value for Noise reducer filter.
                        For  AVC  outputs, when you include Noise reducer, you
                        cannot include the Bandwidth reduction filter.

                        Filter -> (string)
                            Use Noise reducer filter to select one of the fol-
                            lowing  spatial  image filtering functions. To use
                            this setting, you must also enable Noise  reducer.

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings for a noise reducer filter

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Relative  strength  of  noise  reducing filter.
                               Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                        SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Noise reducer filter settings for spatial filter.

                            PostFilterSharpenStrength -> (integer)
                               Specify strength of post noise reduction sharp-
                               ening filter, with 0 disabling the filter and 3
                               enabling it at maximum strength.

                            Speed -> (integer)
                               The speed of the filter, from -2 (lower  speed)
                               to  3  (higher speed), with 0 being the nominal
                               value.

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Relative strength  of  noise  reducing  filter.
                               Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                        TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.

                            AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                               Use  Aggressive  mode for content that has com-
                               plex motion.  Higher  values  produce  stronger
                               temporal filtering. This filters highly complex
                               scenes more aggressively and creates better  VQ
                               for low bitrate outputs.

                            PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                               When  you  set  Noise  reducer to Temporal, the
                               bandwidth and sharpness of your output  is  re-
                               duced.  You  can  optionally  use Post temporal
                               sharpening to apply sharpening to the edges  of
                               your output. Note that Post temporal sharpening
                               will also make the bandwidth reduction from the
                               Noise  reducer  smaller.  The default behavior,
                               Auto,  allows  the  transcoder   to   determine
                               whether  to apply sharpening, depending on your
                               input type and quality. When you set Post  tem-
                               poral  sharpening  to Enabled, specify how much
                               sharpening  is  applied  using  Post   temporal
                               sharpening strength. Set Post temporal sharpen-
                               ing to Disabled to not apply sharpening.

                            PostTemporalSharpeningStrength -> (string)
                               Use Post temporal sharpening strength to define
                               the amount of sharpening the transcoder applies
                               to your output. Set  Post  temporal  sharpening
                               strength  to  Low,  Medium, or High to indicate
                               the amount of sharpening.

                            Speed -> (integer)
                               The speed  of  the  filter  (higher  number  is
                               faster).  Low  setting  reduces bit rate at the
                               cost of transcode time, high  setting  improves
                               transcode time at the cost of bit rate.

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Specify the strength of the noise reducing fil-
                               ter  on  this  output.  Higher  values  produce
                               stronger  filtering. We recommend the following
                               value ranges, depending on the result that  you
                               want: * 0-2 for complexity reduction with mini-
                               mal sharpness loss * 2-8 for complexity  reduc-
                               tion  with image preservation * 8-16 for a high
                               level of complexity reduction

                     PartnerWatermarking -> (structure)
                        If you work with  a  third  party  video  watermarking
                        partner,  use  the  group  of settings that correspond
                        with your watermarking partner to  include  watermarks
                        in your output.

                        NexguardFileMarkerSettings -> (structure)
                            For forensic video watermarking, MediaConvert sup-
                            ports Nagra NexGuard File Marker watermarking. Me-
                            diaConvert   supports   both   PreRelease  Content
                            (NGPR/G2) and OTT Streaming workflows.

                            License -> (string)
                               Use the base64 license string that  Nagra  pro-
                               vides  you.  Enter it directly in your JSON job
                               specification or in the console. Required  when
                               you  include  Nagra NexGuard File Marker water-
                               marking in your job.

                            Payload -> (integer)
                               Specify the payload ID that you want associated
                               with  this  output. Valid values vary depending
                               on your Nagra  NexGuard  forensic  watermarking
                               workflow.  Required when you include Nagra Nex-
                               Guard File Marker watermarking in your job. For
                               PreRelease  Content (NGPR/G2), specify an inte-
                               ger from 1 through 4,194,303. You must generate
                               a  unique  ID for each asset you watermark, and
                               keep a record of which ID you have assigned  to
                               each asset. Neither Nagra nor MediaConvert keep
                               track of the relationship between output  files
                               and  your  IDs.  For  OTT Streaming, create two
                               adaptive bitrate (ABR) stacks for  each  asset.
                               Do  this  by  setting up two output groups. For
                               one output group, set the value of  Payload  ID
                               to  0  in  every  output.  For the other output
                               group, set Payload ID to 1 in every output.

                            Preset -> (string)
                               Enter one of the  watermarking  preset  strings
                               that  Nagra provides you. Required when you in-
                               clude Nagra NexGuard File  Marker  watermarking
                               in your job.

                            Strength -> (string)
                               Optional. Ignore this setting unless Nagra sup-
                               port directs you to specify a value.  When  you
                               don't  specify a value here, the Nagra NexGuard
                               library uses its default value.

                     TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                        Settings for burning the output timecode and specified
                        prefix into the output.

                        FontSize -> (integer)
                            Use  Font  size  to  set  the  font  size  of  any
                            burned-in timecode. Valid values are 10,  16,  32,
                            48.

                        Position -> (string)
                            Use Position under Timecode burn-in to specify the
                            location the burned-in timecode on output video.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            Use Prefix to place ASCII  characters  before  any
                            burned-in timecode. For example, a prefix of "EZ-"
                            will result in the timecode "EZ-00:00:00:00". Pro-
                            vide either the characters themselves or the ASCII
                            code equivalents. The supported range  of  charac-
                            ters  is 0x20 through 0x7e. This includes letters,
                            numbers, and all special characters represented on
                            a standard English keyboard.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Use  Width  to define the video resolution width, in pix-
                     els, for this output. To use the same resolution as  your
                     input: Leave both Width and Height blank. To evenly scale
                     from your input resolution: Leave Width blank and enter a
                     value for Height. For example, if your input is 1920x1080
                     and you set Height to 720, your output will be 1280x720.

          Type -> (string)
              A preset can be of  two  types:  system  or  custom.  System  or
              built-in preset can't be modified or deleted by the user.
