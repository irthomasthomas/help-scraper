SYNOPSIS
            create-edge-deployment-stage
          --edge-deployment-plan-name <value>
          --stages <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --edge-deployment-plan-name (string)
          The name of the edge deployment plan.

       --stages (list)
          List of stages to be added to the edge deployment plan.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a stage in an edge deployment plan.

              StageName -> (string)
                 The name of the stage.

              DeviceSelectionConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration of the devices in the stage.

                 DeviceSubsetType -> (string)
                     Type of device subsets to deploy to the current stage.

                 Percentage -> (integer)
                     Percentage  of devices in the fleet to deploy to the cur-
                     rent stage.

                 DeviceNames -> (list)
                     List of devices chosen to deploy.

                     (string)

                 DeviceNameContains -> (string)
                     A filter to select devices  with  names  containing  this
                     name.

              DeploymentConfig -> (structure)
                 Configuration of the deployment details.

                 FailureHandlingPolicy -> (string)
                     Toggle  that  determines  whether to rollback to previous

                     investigate the errors yourself.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StageName=string,DeviceSelectionConfig={DeviceSubsetType=string,Percentage=integer,DeviceNames=[string,string],DeviceNameContains=string},DeploymentConfig={FailureHandlingPolicy=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StageName": "string",
              "DeviceSelectionConfig": {
                "DeviceSubsetType": "PERCENTAGE"|"SELECTION"|"NAMECONTAINS",
                "Percentage": integer,
                "DeviceNames": ["string", ...],
                "DeviceNameContains": "string"
              },
              "DeploymentConfig": {
                "FailureHandlingPolicy": "ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE"|"DO_NOTHING"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
