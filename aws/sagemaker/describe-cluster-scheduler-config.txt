NAME
       describe-cluster-scheduler-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Description of the cluster policy. This policy is used for task priori-
       tization and fair-share  allocation.  This  helps  prioritize  critical
       workloads and distributes idle compute across entities.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-scheduler-config-id (string)
          ID of the cluster policy.

       --cluster-scheduler-config-version (integer)
          Version of the cluster policy.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ClusterSchedulerConfigArn -> (string)
          ARN of the cluster policy.

       ClusterSchedulerConfigId -> (string)
          ID of the cluster policy.

       Name -> (string)
          Name of the cluster policy.

       ClusterSchedulerConfigVersion -> (integer)
          Version of the cluster policy.

       Status -> (string)
          Status of the cluster policy.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          Failure reason of the cluster policy.

       ClusterArn -> (string)
          ARN of the cluster where the cluster policy is applied.

       SchedulerConfig -> (structure)
          Cluster policy configuration. This policy is used for task prioriti-
          zation and fair-share allocation.  This  helps  prioritize  critical
          workloads and distributes idle compute across entities.

          PriorityClasses -> (list)
              List  of  the  priority  classes, PriorityClass , of the cluster
              policy. When specified, these class  configurations  define  how
              tasks are queued.

              (structure)
                 Priority  class  configuration.  When  included  in Priority-
                 Classes , these class configurations  define  how  tasks  are
                 queued.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name of the priority class.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     Weight of the priority class. The value is within a range
                     from 0 to 100, where 0 is the default.

                     A weight of 0 is the lowest priority and 100 is the high-
                     est. Weight 0 is the default.

          FairShare -> (string)
              When  enabled,  entities  borrow idle compute based on their as-
              signed FairShareWeight .

              When  disabled,  entities  borrow  idle  compute  based   on   a
              first-come first-serve basis.

              Default is Enabled .
