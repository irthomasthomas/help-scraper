OPTIONS
       --workteam-name (string)
          The name of the work team to return a description of.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

              Workforces  can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC
              Identity Provider (IdP). For private  workforces  created  using
              Amazon Cognito use CognitoMemberDefinition . For workforces cre-
              ated using your own OIDC identity provider  (IdP)  use  OidcMem-
              berDefinition .

                        Amazon S3 and must match in order for  the  Amazon  S3

                        side the VPC is added to the IAM policy as a Condition
                        used to generate the Amazon S3 presigned URL. To  ren-
                        der  the  task  successfully Amazon S3 checks that the
                        presigned URL is being accessed over an Amazon S3  VPC
                        Endpoint, and that the worker's IP address matches the
                        IP address in the IAM policy. To learn more about con-
