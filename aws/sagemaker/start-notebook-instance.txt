START-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()                            START-NOTEBOOK-INSTANCE()



NAME
       start-notebook-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Launches  an  ML  compute  instance  with the latest version of the li-
       braries and attaches your ML  storage  volume.  After  configuring  the
       notebook  instance,  SageMaker sets the notebook instance status to In-
       Service . A notebook instance's status must be InService before you can
       connect to your Jupyter notebook.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-notebook-instance
          --notebook-instance-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --notebook-instance-name (string)
          The name of the notebook instance to start.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
