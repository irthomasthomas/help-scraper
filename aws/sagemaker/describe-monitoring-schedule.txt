OPTIONS
       --monitoring-schedule-name (string)
          Name of a previously created monitoring schedule.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       MonitoringScheduleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleName -> (string)
          Name of the monitoring schedule.

       MonitoringScheduleStatus -> (string)
          The status of an monitoring job.

       MonitoringType -> (string)
          The type of the monitoring job that this schedule runs. This is  one
          of the following values.

          o DATA_QUALITY - The schedule is for a data quality monitoring job.

          o MODEL_QUALITY  -  The  schedule  is for a model quality monitoring
            job.

          o MODEL_BIAS - The schedule is for a bias monitoring job.

          o MODEL_EXPLAINABILITY - The schedule is for an explainability moni-
            toring job.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          A  string, up to one KB in size, that contains the reason a monitor-
          ing job failed, if it failed.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the monitoring job was last modified.

       MonitoringScheduleConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration object that specifies the monitoring schedule  and
          defines the monitoring job.

          ScheduleConfig -> (structure)
              Configures the monitoring schedule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring
                 schedule.

                 The supported cron expressions are:

                 o If you want to set the job to start  every  hour,  use  the
                   following:  Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)

                 o If  you  want to start the job daily:  cron(0 [00-23] ? * *
                   *)

                 o If you want to run the job one time, immediately,  use  the
                   following keyword:  NOW

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Daily at noon UTC: cron(0 12 ? * * *)

                 o Daily at midnight UTC: cron(0 0 ? * * *)

                 To  support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also
                 supported:
                     cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)

                 For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

                 o Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)

                 o Every two hours starting at midnight: cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)

                 NOTE:

                     o Even though the cron expression is set to start at  5PM
                       UTC,  note  that there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes
                       from the actual requested time to run the execution.

                     o We recommend that if you would like a  daily  schedule,
                       you  do  not  provide  this parameter. Amazon SageMaker
                       will pick a time for running every day.

                 You can also specify the keyword NOW to  run  the  monitoring
                 job immediately, one time, without recurring.

              DataAnalysisStartTime -> (string)
                 Sets the start time for a monitoring job window. Express this
                 time as an offset to the times that you schedule  your  moni-
                 toring  jobs  to  run.  You schedule monitoring jobs with the
                 ScheduleExpression parameter. Specify this offset in ISO 8601
                 duration format. For example, if you want to monitor the five
                 hours of data in your dataset that precede the start of  each
                 monitoring job, you would specify: "-PT5H" .

                 The start time that you specify must not precede the end time
                 that you specify by more than 24 hours. You specify  the  end
                 time with the DataAnalysisEndTime parameter.

                 If  you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this parameter is re-
                 quired.

              DataAnalysisEndTime -> (string)
                 Sets the end time for a monitoring job window.  Express  this
                 time  as  an offset to the times that you schedule your moni-
                 toring jobs to run. You schedule  monitoring  jobs  with  the
                 ScheduleExpression parameter. Specify this offset in ISO 8601
                 duration format. For example, if you want to end  the  window
                 one  hour  before the start of each monitoring job, you would
                 specify: "-PT1H" .

                 The end time that you specify must not follow the start  time
                 that you specify by more than 24 hours. You specify the start
                 time with the DataAnalysisStartTime parameter.

                 If you set ScheduleExpression to NOW , this parameter is  re-
                 quired.

                     The name of the job that performs baselining for the mon-
                     itoring job.

                 ConstraintsResource -> (structure)
                     The  baseline  constraint file in Amazon S3 that the cur-
                     rent monitoring job should validated against.

                     S3Uri -> (string)

                 StatisticsResource -> (structure)
                     The baseline statistics file in Amazon S3 that  the  cur-
                     rent monitoring job should be validated against.

                            is  useful for small files that fit in memory. De-
