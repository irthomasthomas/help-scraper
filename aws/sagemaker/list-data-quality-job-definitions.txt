LIST-DATA-QUALITY-JOB-DEFINITIONS()        LIST-DATA-QUALITY-JOB-DEFINITIONS()



NAME
       list-data-quality-job-definitions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the data quality job definitions in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-data-quality-job-definitions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: JobDefinitionSummaries

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          A filter that lists the data quality job definitions associated with
          the specified endpoint.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field to sort results by. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          Whether  to  sort  the results in Ascending or Descending order. The
          default is Descending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --name-contains (string)
          A string in the data quality monitoring job  definition  name.  This
          filter  returns  only  data quality monitoring job definitions whose
          name contains the specified string.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns only data quality monitoring  job  definitions
          created before the specified time.

       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter  that returns only data quality monitoring job definitions
          created after the specified time.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       JobDefinitionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of data quality monitoring job definitions.

          (structure)
              Summary information about a monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionName -> (string)
                 The name of the monitoring job.

              MonitoringJobDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitoring job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the monitoring job was created.

              EndpointName -> (string)
                 The name of the endpoint that the job monitors.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the result of the previous ListDataQualityJobDefinitions request
          was truncated, the response includes a NextToken . To  retrieve  the
          next  set  of data quality monitoring job definitions, use the token
          in the next request.
