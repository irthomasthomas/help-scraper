OPTIONS
       --creation-time-after (timestamp)
          A  filter that returns the projects that were created after a speci-
          fied time.

       --creation-time-before (timestamp)
          A filter that returns the projects that were created before a speci-
          fied time.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of projects to return in the response.

       --name-contains (string)
          A  filter  that returns the projects whose name contains a specified
          string.

       --next-token (string)
          If the result of the previous ListProjects  request  was  truncated,
          the  response  includes  a  NextToken  . To retrieve the next set of
          projects, use the token in the next request.

       --sort-by (string)
          The field by which to sort results. The default is CreationTime .

          Possible values:

          o Name

          o CreationTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The sort order for results. The default is Ascending .

          Possible values:

          o Ascending

          o Descending

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
