SYNOPSIS
            update-feature-group
          --feature-group-name <value>

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the feature group that you're updating.

       --feature-additions (list)
          A list of the features that you're adding to the feature group.

          (structure)
              A list of features. You must include FeatureName and FeatureType
              . Valid feature FeatureType s  are  Integral  ,  Fractional  and
              String .

              FeatureName -> (string)
                 The name of a feature. The type must be a string. FeatureName
                 cannot be any of the following:  is_deleted  ,  write_time  ,
                 api_invocation_time .

              FeatureType -> (string)
                 The value type of a feature. Valid values are Integral, Frac-
                 tional, or String.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FeatureName=string,FeatureType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FeatureName": "string",
              "FeatureType": "Integral"|"Fractional"|"String"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FeatureGroupArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Number (ARN) of the feature group that you're
          updating.
