UPDATE-FEATURE-GROUP()                                  UPDATE-FEATURE-GROUP()



NAME
       update-feature-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the feature group by either adding features or updating the on-
       line store configuration. Use one of the following  request  parameters
       at a time while using the UpdateFeatureGroup API.

       You  can add features for your feature group using the FeatureAdditions
       request parameter. Features cannot be removed from a feature group.

       You can update the online store configuration by using the OnlineStore-
       Config  request  parameter.  If a TtlDuration is specified, the default
       TtlDuration applies for all records added to the  feature  group  after
       the  feature  group  is  updated . If a record level TtlDuration exists
       from using the PutRecord API, the record level TtlDuration  applies  to
       that  record instead of the default TtlDuration . To remove the default
       TtlDuration from an existing feature group, use the  UpdateFeatureGroup
       API and set the TtlDuration  Unit and Value to null .

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the feature group that
          you're updating.

       --feature-additions (list)
          Updates the feature group. Updating a feature group is an  asynchro-
          nous  operation.  When  you  get an HTTP 200 response, you've made a
          valid request. It takes some time after you've made a valid  request
          for Feature Store to update the feature group.

          (structure)
              A list of features. You must include FeatureName and FeatureType
              . Valid feature FeatureType s  are  Integral  ,  Fractional  and
              String .

              FeatureName -> (string)
                 The name of a feature. The type must be a string. FeatureName
                 cannot be any of the following:  is_deleted  ,  write_time  ,
                 api_invocation_time .

                 The name:

                 o Must start with an alphanumeric character.

                 o Can  only include alphanumeric characters, underscores, and
                   hyphens. Spaces are not allowed.

              FeatureType -> (string)
                 The value type of a feature. Valid values are Integral, Frac-
                 tional, or String.

              CollectionType -> (string)
                 A  grouping of elements where each element within the collec-
                 tion must have the same feature type (String , Integral ,  or
                 Fractional ).

                 o List : An ordered collection of elements.

                 o Set : An unordered collection of unique elements.

                 o Vector  :  A  specialized list that represents a fixed-size
                   array of elements. The vector dimension  is  determined  by
                   you. Must have elements with fractional feature types.

              CollectionConfig -> (tagged union structure)
                 Configuration for your collection.

                 NOTE:
                     This is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the follow-
                     ing top level keys can be set: VectorConfig.

                 VectorConfig -> (structure)
                     Configuration for your vector collection type.

                     o Dimension : The number of elements in your vector.

                     Dimension -> (integer)
                        The number of elements in your vector.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FeatureName=string,FeatureType=string,CollectionType=string,CollectionConfig={VectorConfig={Dimension=integer}} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "FeatureName": "string",
              "FeatureType": "Integral"|"Fractional"|"String",
              "CollectionType": "List"|"Set"|"Vector",
              "CollectionConfig": {
                "VectorConfig": {
                  "Dimension": integer
                }
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --online-store-config (structure)
          Updates the feature group online store configuration.

          TtlDuration -> (structure)
              Time to live duration, where the record is  hard  deleted  after
              the expiration time is reached; ExpiresAt = EventTime + TtlDura-
              tion . For information on HardDelete, see the  DeleteRecord  API
              in the Amazon SageMaker API Reference guide.

              Unit -> (string)
                 TtlDuration time unit.

              Value -> (integer)
                 TtlDuration time value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TtlDuration={Unit=string,Value=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TtlDuration": {
              "Unit": "Seconds"|"Minutes"|"Hours"|"Days"|"Weeks",
              "Value": integer
            }
          }

       --throughput-config (structure)
          The  new  throughput  configuration  for  the feature group. You can
          switch between on-demand and provisioned modes or update the read  /
          write  capacity of provisioned feature groups. You can switch a fea-
          ture group to on-demand only once in a 24 hour period.

          ThroughputMode -> (string)
              Target throughput mode of the feature group.  Throughput  update
              is  an  asynchronous  operation, and the outcome should be moni-
              tored by polling LastUpdateStatus field in  DescribeFeatureGroup
              response.  You  cannot update a feature group's throughput while
              another update is in progress.

          ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              For provisioned feature groups with online store  enabled,  this
              indicates the read throughput you are billed for and can consume
              without throttling.

          ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits -> (integer)
              For  provisioned  feature  groups,  this  indicates  the   write
              throughput  you  are  billed  for and can consume without throt-
              tling.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ThroughputMode=string,ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits=integer,ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ThroughputMode": "OnDemand"|"Provisioned",
            "ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits": integer,
            "ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
