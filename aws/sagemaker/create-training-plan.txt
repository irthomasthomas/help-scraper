CREATE-TRAINING-PLAN()                                  CREATE-TRAINING-PLAN()



NAME
       create-training-plan -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new training plan in SageMaker to reserve compute capacity.

       Amazon  SageMaker  Training  Plan is a capability within SageMaker that
       allows customers to reserve and manage GPU capacity for large-scale  AI
       model  training. It provides a way to secure predictable access to com-
       putational resources within specific timelines and budgets, without the
       need to manage underlying infrastructure.
          How it works

       Plans  can be created for specific resources such as SageMaker Training
       Jobs or SageMaker HyperPod  clusters,  automatically  provisioning  re-
       sources,  setting  up infrastructure, executing workloads, and handling
       infrastructure failures.
          Plan creation workflow

       o Users search for available plan offerings based on their requirements
         (e.g.,  instance  type,  count,  start  time,  duration) using the ``
         SearchTrainingPlanOfferings `` API operation.

       o They create a plan that best matches their needs using the ID of  the
         plan offering they want to use.

       o After successful upfront payment, the plan's status becomes Scheduled
         .

       o The plan can be used to:

         o Queue training jobs.

         o Allocate to an instance group of a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

       o When the plan start date arrives, it becomes Active . Based on avail-
         able reserved capacity:

         o Training jobs are launched.

         o Instance groups are provisioned.
          Plan composition

       A  plan can consist of one or more Reserved Capacities, each defined by
       a specific instance type, quantity, Availability  Zone,  duration,  and
       start  and end times. For more information about Reserved Capacity, see
       `` ReservedCapacitySummary `` .

OPTIONS
       --training-plan-name (string)
          The name of the training plan to create.

       --training-plan-offering-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the training plan offering to use for  cre-
          ating this plan.

       --tags (list)
          An array of key-value pairs to apply to this training plan.

          (structure)
              A  tag object that consists of a key and an optional value, used
              to manage metadata for SageMaker Amazon Web Services resources.

              You can add tags to notebook instances, training jobs,  hyperpa-
              rameter  tuning  jobs,  batch  transform  jobs, models, labeling
              jobs, work teams, endpoint configurations,  and  endpoints.  For
              more  information  on  adding  tags  to SageMaker resources, see
              AddTags .

              For more information on adding metadata to your Amazon Web  Ser-
              vices  resources  with  tagging, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
              resources . For advice on best practices for managing Amazon Web
              Services resources with tagging, see Tagging Best Practices: Im-
              plement an Effective Amazon Web Services Resource Tagging Strat-
              egy .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key. Tag keys must be unique per resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.
