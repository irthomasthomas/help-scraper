CREATE-AUTO-ML-JOB-V2()                                CREATE-AUTO-ML-JOB-V2()



NAME
       create-auto-ml-job-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Autopilot  job also referred to as Autopilot experiment or
       AutoML job V2.

       NOTE:
              CreateAutoMLJobV2 and DescribeAutoMLJobV2 are  new  versions  of
              CreateAutoMLJob  and DescribeAutoMLJob which offer backward com-
              patibility.

              CreateAutoMLJobV2 can manage tabular problem types identical  to
              those  of  its  previous  version  CreateAutoMLJob  , as well as
              non-tabular problem types such as image or text classification.

          Find guidelines about how to migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to  CreateAu-
          toMLJobV2 in Migrate a CreateAutoMLJob to CreateAutoMLJobV2 .

       For  the list of available problem types supported by CreateAutoMLJobV2
       , see AutoMLProblemTypeConfig .

       You can find the best-performing model after you run an AutoML  job  V2
       by calling DescribeAutoMLJobV2 .

OPTIONS
       --auto-ml-job-name (string)
          Identifies an Autopilot job. The name must be unique to your account
          and is case insensitive.

       --auto-ml-job-input-data-config (list)
          An array of channel objects describing the input data and their  lo-
          cation.  Each  channel  is  a  named  input  source.  Similar to the
          InputDataConfig attribute in the CreateAutoMLJob  input  parameters.
          The supported formats depend on the problem type:

          o For Tabular problem types: S3Prefix , ManifestFile .

          o For  ImageClassification: S3Prefix , ManifestFile , AugmentedMani-
            festFile .

          o For TextClassification: S3Prefix .

          (structure)
              A channel is a named input source that training  algorithms  can
              consume.  This  channel is used for AutoML jobs V2 (jobs created
              by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ).

              ChannelType -> (string)
                 The type of channel. Defines whether the data  are  used  for
                 training or validation. The default value is training . Chan-
                 nels for training and validation must share the same Content-
                 Type

              ContentType -> (string)
                 The  content type of the data from the input source. The fol-
                 lowing are the allowed content types for different problems:

                 o For Tabular problem types: text/csv;header=present or x-ap-
                   plication/vnd.amazon+parquet   .   The   default  value  is
                   text/csv;header=present .

                 o For ImageClassification: image/png , image/jpeg  ,  or  im-
                   age/* . The default value is image/* .

                 o For TextClassification: text/csv;header=present or x-appli-
                   cation/vnd.amazon+parquet   .   The   default   value    is
                   text/csv;header=present .

              CompressionType -> (string)
                 The  allowed compression types depend on the input format and
                 problem type. We allow the compression type Gzip for S3Prefix
                 inputs  on  tabular data only. For all other inputs, the com-
                 pression type should be None . If no compression type is pro-
                 vided, we default to None .

              DataSource -> (structure)
                 The data source for an AutoML channel (Required).

                 S3DataSource -> (structure)
                     The Amazon S3 location of the input data.

                     S3DataType -> (string)
                        The data type.

                        o If you choose S3Prefix , S3Uri identifies a key name
                          prefix. SageMaker uses all objects  that  match  the
                          specified  key  name  prefix for model training. The
                          S3Prefix   should   have   the   following   format:
                          s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER-OR-FILE

                        o If you choose ManifestFile , S3Uri identifies an ob-
                          ject that is a manifest file containing  a  list  of
                          object keys that you want SageMaker to use for model
                          training. A  ManifestFile  should  have  the  format
                          shown    below:     [   {"prefix":   "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DOC-EXAMPLE-PREFIX/"},
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-1",               "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELA-
                          TIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-2",            ...
                          "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-FOLDER/DATA-N" ]

                        o If  you choose AugmentedManifestFile , S3Uri identi-
                          fies an object that is an augmented manifest file in
                          JSON  lines  format. This file contains the data you
                          want to use for model  training.  AugmentedManifest-
                          File is available for V2 API jobs only (for example,
                          for jobs created  by  calling  CreateAutoMLJobV2  ).
                          Here  is a minimal, single-record example of an Aug-
                          mentedManifestFile :  {"source-ref": "s3://DOC-EXAM-
                          PLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/cats/cat.jpg",    "la-
                          bel-metadata": {"class-name": "cat" } For  more  in-

                          Dataset Metadata to Training Jobs with an  Augmented
                          Manifest File .

                     S3Uri -> (string)
                        The  URL  to the Amazon S3 data source. The Uri refers
                        to the Amazon S3 prefix or ManifestFile  depending  on
                        the data type.

       --auto-ml-problem-type-config (tagged union structure)
          Defines the configuration settings of one of the  supported  problem
          types.

          NOTE:
              This  is a Tagged Union structure. Only one of the following top
              level keys can be set: ImageClassificationJobConfig, TextClassi-
              ficationJobConfig, TabularJobConfig.

          ImageClassificationJobConfig -> (structure)
              Settings  used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the image clas-
              sification problem type.

              CompletionCriteria -> (structure)
                 How long a job is allowed to run, or how  many  candidates  a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The  maximum number of times a training job is allowed to
                     run.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to  run  as
                     part  of  a  hyperparameter tuning job. For more informa-
                     tion,   see   the   StoppingCondition   used    by    the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                     The maximum runtime, in seconds, an  AutoML  job  has  to
                     complete.

                     If  an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is
                     stopped automatically and its processing is ended  grace-
                     fully.  The  AutoML  job  identifies the best model whose
                     training was completed and marks it as the  best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not  com-
                     pleted.

          TextClassificationJobConfig -> (structure)

                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted inside hyperparameter tuning is allowed to  run  as
                     part  of  a  hyperparameter tuning job. For more informa-

                     The maximum runtime, in seconds, an  AutoML  job  has  to
                     complete.

                     If  an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is
                     stopped automatically and its processing is ended  grace-
                     fully.  The  AutoML  job  identifies the best model whose
                     training was completed and marks it as the  best-perform-

                     Stores the configuration information for the selection of
                     algorithms  used  to  train  model  candidates on tabular
                     data.

                     The list of available algorithms to choose  from  depends
                     on  the  training  mode  set  in  ` TabularJobConfig.Mode
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_TabularJobConfig.html`__

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is provided, one AutoMLAlgorithms
                       attribute  must be set and one only. If the list of al-
                       gorithms provided as  values  for  AutoMLAlgorithms  is
                       empty,  CandidateGenerationConfig  uses the full set of
                       algorithms for the given training mode.

                     o When AlgorithmsConfig is not provided, CandidateGenera-
                       tionConfig  uses  the  full  set  of algorithms for the
                       given training mode.

                     For the list of  all  algorithms  per  problem  type  and
                     training mode, see AutoMLAlgorithmConfig .

                     For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithm
                     support section in Autopilot developer guide.

                     (structure)
                        The collection of algorithms  run  on  a  dataset  for
                        training the model candidates of an Autopilot job.

                 How  long  a  job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a
                 job is allowed to generate.

                 MaxCandidates -> (integer)
                     The maximum number of times a training job is allowed  to
                     run.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     the supported value is 1.

                 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job exe-
                     cuted  inside  hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as
                     part of a hyperparameter tuning job.  For  more  informa-
                     tion,    see    the   StoppingCondition   used   by   the
                     CreateHyperParameterTuningJob action.

                     For job V2s (jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJobV2 ),
                     this field controls the runtime of the job candidate.

                 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  runtime,  in  seconds, an AutoML job has to
                     complete.

                     If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job  is
                     stopped  automatically and its processing is ended grace-
                     fully. The AutoML job identifies  the  best  model  whose
                     training  was completed and marks it as the best-perform-
                     ing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as auto-
                     matic  one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not com-
                     pleted.

              FeatureSpecificationS3Uri -> (string)
                 A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing  selected  fea-
                 tures  from the input data source to run an Autopilot job V2.
                 You can input FeatureAttributeNames (optional) in JSON format
                 as shown below:
                     { "FeatureAttributeNames":["col1", "col2", ...] } .

                 You  can also specify the data type of the feature (optional)
                 in the format shown below:
                     { "FeatureDataTypes":{"col1":"numeric", "col2":"categori-
                     cal" ... } }

                 NOTE:
                     These column keys may not include the target column.

                 In  ensembling  mode,  Autopilot  only supports the following
                 data types: numeric , categorical , text , and datetime .  In
                 HPO  mode, Autopilot can support numeric , categorical , text
                 , datetime , and sequence .

                 If only FeatureDataTypes is provided, the column keys (col1 ,
                 col2 ,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input
                 data.

                 If both FeatureDataTypes and FeatureAttributeNames  are  pro-
                 vided,  then the column keys should be a subset of the column
                 names provided in FeatureAttributeNames .

                 The key  name  FeatureAttributeNames  is  fixed.  The  values
                 listed in ["col1", "col2", ...] are case sensitive and should
                 be a list of strings containing unique values that are a sub-
                 set  of  the column names in the input data. The list of col-
                 umns provided must not include the target column.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can ei-
                 ther  specify  the  mode manually or let Autopilot choose for
                 you based on the dataset size by selecting  AUTO  .  In  AUTO
                 mode,  Autopilot chooses ENSEMBLING for datasets smaller than
                 100 MB, and HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING for larger ones.

                 The ENSEMBLING mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to pre-
                 dict  classification  and regression tasks directly from your
                 dataset. This machine learning  mode  combines  several  base
                 models to produce an optimal predictive model. It then uses a
                 stacking ensemble method to  combine  predictions  from  con-
                 tributing  members.  A multi-stack ensemble model can provide
                 better performance over a single model by combining the  pre-
                 dictive  capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algo-
                 rithm support for a list of algorithms  supported  by  ENSEM-
                 BLING mode.

                 The  HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING  (HPO) mode uses the best hyperpa-
                 rameters to train the best version of a model. HPO  automati-
                 cally  selects  an algorithm for the type of problem you want
                 to solve. Then HPO finds the best  hyperparameters  according
                 to your objective metric. See Autopilot algorithm support for
                 a list of algorithms supported by HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING mode.

              GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly -> (boolean)
                 Generates possible candidates without training the models.  A
                 model candidate is a combination of data preprocessors, algo-
                 rithms, and algorithm parameter settings.

              ProblemType -> (string)
                 The type of supervised learning  problem  available  for  the
                 model  candidates of the AutoML job V2. For more information,
                 see Amazon SageMaker Autopilot problem types .

                 NOTE:
                     You must either specify the type of  supervised  learning
                     problem in ProblemType and provide the AutoMLJobObjective
                     metric, or none at all.

              TargetAttributeName -> (string)
                 The name of the target variable in supervised learning,  usu-
                 ally represented by 'y'.

              SampleWeightAttributeName -> (string)
                 If  specified, this column name indicates which column of the
                 dataset should be treated as sample weights for  use  by  the
                 objective metric during the training, evaluation, and the se-
                 lection of the best model. This column is not considered as a
                 predictive  feature.  For  more information on Autopilot met-
                 rics, see Metrics and validation .

                 Sample weights should be numeric, non-negative,  with  larger
                 values  indicating which rows are more important than others.
                 Data points that have invalid or  no  weight  value  are  ex-
                 cluded.

                 Support  for  sample  weights is available in Ensembling mode
                 only.

              Set to True to automatically generate an  endpoint  name  for  a
              one-click  Autopilot  model  deployment; set to False otherwise.
              The default value is False .

              NOTE:
                 If you set AutoGenerateEndpointName to True , do not  specify
                 the EndpointName ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

          EndpointName -> (string)
              Specifies  the  endpoint  name  to use for a one-click Autopilot
              model deployment if the endpoint name is not generated automati-
              cally.

              NOTE:
                 Specify  the  EndpointName if and only if you set AutoGenera-
                 teEndpointName to False ; otherwise a 400 error is thrown.

          For jobs created by calling CreateAutoMLJob , the validation dataset
          must be less than 2 GB in size.

          ValidationFraction -> (float)
              The validation fraction (optional) is a float that specifies the
              portion of the training dataset to be used for  validation.  The
              default value is 0.2, and values must be greater than 0 and less
              than 1. We recommend setting this value to be less than 0.5.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
